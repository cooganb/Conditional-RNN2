['finances', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>Tattered and yellowing, stored away in boxes, attics and safe deposits, millions of unpaid Czarist Russian bonds have for decades kept alive the dreams of many French families that one day they would strike it rich.</p> <p>Many bondholders, it is true, lost faith in Moscow, variously giving away, destroying or misplacing bonds inherited from grandparents and, in some cases, simply using them as wallpaper or selling them as souvenirs as final evidence of their worthlessness.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he was prepared to resign as Soviet President as momentum toward acceptance of the newly proclaimed commonwealth of former Soviet republics built rapidly. The Russian Parliament gave the commonwealth an overwhelming endorsement, and the Asian republics moved toward joining.</p> <p>Mr. Gorbachev continued to argue forcefully against the commonwealth abruptly proclaimed by Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia on Sunday. But in a three-hour session with Soviet journalists in which he was alternately angry, proud and troubled, he appeared to be steeling himself for a resignation that seemed increasingly inevitable.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>After a long day of disputes, the former Soviet republics agreed today that individual members of their new Commonwealth of Independent States could form separate armies, though strategic weapons would remain under a single command.</p> <p>The decision to let the states decide on whether to build their own forces or to remain part of a common defense was agreed to in a bargaining session of sharp differences and private compromise that let each of the 11 former republics decide its own military fate.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>A Lebanese newspaper reported today that Syria was negotiating a $2 billion arms deal with Russia involving advanced jet fighters and bombers and long-range surface-to-air missiles.</p> <p>The daily, Al Hayat, citing Russian informants in London, said the deal was about to be closed after the Syrians had agreed to pay cash in hard currency, as the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded.</p>

Yeltsin's financial advisers are pushing to achieve this goal in the next few weeks -- over the objections of the Russian central bank and the doubts of the Bush Administration.</p> <p>The battle over convertible currency, which would greatly increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors, is the most visible aspect of a larger struggle between those who want the Yeltsin Government to end numerous subsidies and payments to the people as quickly as possible, and those who favor a slower phasing out of Government supports.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'currency']	<p>Protecting its shaky first step toward the free market, Russia introduced border embargoes on most basic consumer goods today to prevent a raid on its limited retail supplies by neighboring republics.</p> <p>From now on, a full array of products from meat, butter and vodka to televisions and samovars will not be permitted to move from the republic, and travelers are to be scrutinized to prevent them from leaving with anything more than subsistence rations.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'public opinion']	<p>With the harsh fact of price rises sinking in across the nation, the Speaker of the Russian Parliament called today for the resignation of the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin for having enacted "uncontrolled, anarchic" economic reforms.</p> <p>The call by the Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, was quickly rejected by a spokesman for the Russian Government, which denied as well that Mr. Yeltsin might resign his second job as Prime Minister in reaction to the growing political protest over price rises. Mr. Khasbulatov is a popular politician who had made it clear lately that he was breaking away from Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Leonid M. Kravchuk said today that Ukraine was in the process of smoothing out its sharp political and military disagreements with Russia.</p> <p>The 57-year-old former Communist leader, who was elected President of Ukraine five weeks ago, also said that he was about to replace a number of old-line Cabinet members with younger officials who favor a quick transition to a market economy.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The Bush Administration, in a policy switch aimed at more quickly assisting the economic transformation of Russia and five other former Soviet republics, urged today that they be admitted to full membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p> <p>Membership in the fund and the World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- the former republics with which the United States is initially establishing diplomatic relations -- could allow them access to billions of dollars in development loans to help make the unsettling transition from a centralized to a free-market economy.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The Bush Administration is considering several plans to provide assistance to Russian nuclear scientists to keep them from accepting offers to work in developing nations trying to build weapons, the State Department said today.</p> <p>Congressional leaders and private organizations concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons are pressing the Bush Administration to act quickly to provide assistance not only to prevent a brain drain but also to speed up the process of dismantling weapons in the former Soviet Union, a process that the scientists could assist.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Under attack from all sides for policies that have let prices soar, the Russian Government won reluctant approval today for the next phase of its painful economic reforms: a budget that it says is virtually deficit-free but calls for deep spending cuts and higher taxes.</p> <p>As Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the reforms, explained to Parliament today, a balanced budget and a tight monetary policy are necessary if Russia is to keep hyperinflation at bay and pull itself toward a market economy.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>The 47-nation conference on coordinating aid to the former Soviet Union opens at the State Department on Wednesday, with a host of tensions between the United States and its allies bubbling just beneath the surface over how best to help Russia and the other republics, officials and experts involved say.</p> <p>At issue are both clashing egos and clashing policies. Many European officials, who were not consulted about the conference before it was announced, say they resent the leadership role being taken by the United States, which some of them argue is an effort to disguise how little Washington is actually doing. No longer feeling the need for Washington's security umbrella after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Europeans are increasingly speaking their mind.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Leaders of an American Jewish group held talks yesterday with the Foreign Minister of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh in what was apparently the first such meeting ever on Saudi soil.</p> <p>Seven executives of the group, the American Jewish Congress, spent nearly an hour with the Foreign Minister, Prince Saud, during which they discussed the stalled Middle East peace talks, which are to resume in Moscow at the end of this month.</p>
['religion and churches', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Institute for Marxism-Leninism, once the inner sanctum of scholarly privilege for Communist ideologues, has changed its slant along with its name.  It is now called the Russian Center for the Study of the Documents of Modern History, a careful title with no ism or ax to grind.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>When the "reactionary forces" in Congress recently voted to slash financing for President Bush's "perestroika" plan to privatize public housing and empower low-income residents to become homeowners, I couldn't help but notice the irony.</p> <p>Today, Russia may be on the verge of the most exciting experiment in entrepreneurial capitalism since 1776. The Russian Government is chopping away at the status quo with enthusiasm. Meanwhile, the most stultified legislative bureaucracy since the fall of the Supreme Soviet -- the U.S. Congress -- is resisting our efforts to launch a historic new war on poverty.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Bush Administration officials said today that the meeting between President Bush and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on Saturday had put ties between their nations "on a new plane" and had set the stage for a visit to Moscow this month by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.</p> <p>At the same time, they expressed some confusion over biting remarks about foreign support for Russia that Mr. Yeltsin made Saturday evening in Canada, only hours after completing talks with Mr. Bush at Camp David.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>After the first five truckloads of 40 tons of donated German butter vanished without a trace into the Russian maw, the administrators of the European Community's emergency food aid program knew well that wariness was at least as important as charity in trying to help this tough and hungry land.</p> <p>"The butter trucks just disappeared," said Elisabeth Apraxine, a Belgian who is one of the visiting community executives administering a program to put $280 million worth of basic foods into the markets of Moscow and St. Petersburg this winter.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Four republics of the former Soviet Union have provided some details to the Bush Administration on plans to eliminate a number of strategic nuclear weapons over the next seven years and to concentrate those remaining on the territory of Russia.</p> <p>Using the framework of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreed to last July between the United States and the Soviet Union, the newly independent republics will remove all strategic nuclear arms from Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the Administration has been advised.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>A delay by the United States in approving a large financing increase for the International Monetary Fund -- motivated in part by election-year politics -- is threatening to upset the West's efforts to provide billions of dollars in aid to Russia and other former Soviet republics, I.M.F. officials say.</p> <p>The United States had promised other I.M.F. members that it would approve a new $12 billion contribution to the lending agency sometime in 1991, but its failure to do so has stalled plans to increase overall financing by $60 billion and thus threatened plans to grant aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Few towns in the world are wealthier than this one, if wealth is measured in oil coming out of the ground. But instead of fine homes and shops, downtown Raduzhny is block after block of eight-story apartment buildings whose outer walls are drab gray concrete slabs, giving the impression that Raduzhny is a huge, rundown housing project.</p> <p>The town's leading citizen, Anatoly Sivak, lives in one of these buildings. Because he is director general of the oil company that runs this Siberian community, his apartment is less cramped than most, and he has three telephones to connect him to his many lieutenants. They are a necessity for his company, which pumps 160,000 barrels a day from the swamps and fields around Raduzhny, a production level that matches that of all of Ecuador.  He Who Would Give Orders</p> <p>But little of the wealth stays in this town, 1,000 miles east of Moscow. Mr. Sivak is maneuvering to change that.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States Embassy, the buttoned-down security compound denounced by its own employees as a bastion of the cold war, is quietly easing its stringent rules against socializing beyond its walls and is once again hiring Russians for menial work.</p> <p>Fourteen of the 15 republics of the former Soviet Union have just been downgraded from "critical" security risks to "high," meaning diplomats can travel to them alone, without chaperones. The regulations for the continuing exception -- Russia -- are likely to be liberalized in the next few weeks.</p>
['space', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As the nation's civilian space program drifts aimlessly, undone by the cold war's demise, calls are rising for the United States to join its former Russian foes in history's most ambitious voyage -- sending humans across many millions of miles of space to explore Mars.</p> <p>The undertaking would tap skills of East and West and give both sides needed new direction, experts say. They note that NASA's $14 billion-a-year budget is under fire and that Moscow's space program is cracking under political and economic problems.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Several thousand assorted opponents of the Russian Government marked Armed Forces Day today by tangling with the police and demanding the restoration of a united Soviet Union.</p> <p>The protest was the latest of several by groups opposed to the new order, primarily staunch Communists but also clutches of nationalists, monarchists and soldiers. Many demonstrators were elderly, pensioners who shouted that they had worked their entire life for the Soviet state and had been left penniless.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'television', 'news and news media']	<p>It began as a low whisper among aides to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But as the plane taking them to Moscow at the close of Mr. Baker's grueling tour of former Soviet republics took off, the whispers grew into a vigorous chant: "Penta, Penta, Penta, Penta."</p> <p>The Penta is the deluxe German-run hotel in Moscow where Mr. Baker always stays. After a week of sleeping often two or three to a room in seedy, run-down former Communist Party guest houses in the wilds of Ashkhabad and Dushanbe, Mr. Baker's aides were desperate for the down comforters, hot water and efficiency of the Penta. It was the first time any of them could recall longing to get to Moscow.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'news and news media']	<p>Leading news publications, including some that helped bring down the Soviet dictatorship, are being forced to curtail operations because of skyrocketing printing costs under free-market reforms now being championed philosophically in newspapers.</p> <p>Muscovites today could not find their daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, which went to alternate-day publication this week because of newsprint costs that have jumped from 300 rubles per ton of paper to 13,000 rubles in the last year. With more than 20 million readers, the newspaper is one of the world's largest.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Beneath the veneer of competence, the Bush Administration's strategy toward the former Soviet Union is a dangerously ineffective response to the greatest democratic awakening and market-opening opportunity of the 20th century. Just as Americans recognize how the Administration has mismanaged the economy, they must now comprehend how its hesitant foreign policy jeopardizes our national security and economic interests.</p> <p>Boris Yeltsin recently told Congressional leaders that Russia is "in a fight for survival" and had only three months to turn things around. Without more international aid, he said, there would be "an explosion."</p>
['espionage', 'biographical information']	<p>They were presented as the last political prisoners of the dreaded Gulag. But when they told their stories, it was more as if the Kremlin had released the last bit-players from an old spy thriller: the Spy, the Prison Guard, the Missile-Targeter, the Cypher-Breaker, the Disgruntled Academic.</p> <p>The stories were as different and as intriguing as their former trades -- one had tried to hijack a plane, one wandered across to China and a year later came back, one spread disinformation in California.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Some of the top nuclear bomb designers of the former Soviet Union, aware of Western concern that they not sell their expertise to hostile powers, presented Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today with a list of commercial scientific projects they were ready to work on if the West would just invest in them.</p> <p>In a remarkable encounter, Mr. Baker became the first Western official known to have visited Chelyabinsk-70, a top-secret military nuclear complex near the old industrial city of Chelyabinsk in the Urals. Chelyabinsk-70 and other secret military towns were not listed on published Soviet maps. A Russian official said the numerical suffix on the name was for postal reasons.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>In a memo circulated privately to his worshipers but meant to bludgeon President Bush publicly, Richard Nixon lays down this warning: If the U.S. doesn't get its act together to save Boris Yeltsin, the question of "Who lost Russia?" will be even more politically devastating in the 90's than "Who lost China?" was in the 50's.</p> <p>I've got three quarrels with the Old Trickster's latest endeavor to help humankind:</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Animosity between Ukraine and Russia broke into the open at a summit meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States today. The Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, publicly lambasted Russia and the commonwealth, saying they had failed to resolve "a single political or military problem."</p> <p>As Ukrainian demonstrators outside branded the commonwealth as a successor to the "evil empire," Mr. Kravchuk asserted that the three-month-old association of former Soviet republics had failed to follow up on any of its decisions, and had proved helpless to stop ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus and in Moldova.</p>
['treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>A long-sought agreement to open the skies over the former Soviet Union, Europe and North America to reconnaissance aircraft flights was reached in Vienna today.</p> <p>Too late for monitoring cold-war troop and missile movements, the Open Skies Treaty will be initialed on Saturday and signed on Tuesday by the 24 nations participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
['ethics']	<p>Acting a bit like the police chief in "Casablanca" who was shocked to find gambling going on in the back room of Rick's, the Russian Government has begun to address the problem of corruption. It is a belated response to the widely held view that under democracy, officials have become even greedier than they were under Communism.</p> <p>"Most residents of the Russian Federation believe the problem has become very acute, that corruption has reached unheard-of proportions," Gennadi Burbulis, the First Deputy Prime Minister, said last Friday as he called for the creation of a new anti-corruption committee.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Responding to criticism by former President Richard M. Nixon that he has not done enough to support democratic reforms in the former Soviet Union, President Bush said today that his Administration does not have a "blank check" to finance extensive aid programs.</p> <p>Mr. Bush did say that his Administration was now considering contributing to a multibillion-dollar international fund to stabilize the ruble, a key ingredient for economic reform in Russia. While other Administration officials have said United States support for such a fund was under consideration, this was the first time Mr. Bush himself had expressed his interest.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Germany has agreed to mediate between Japan and Russia on a longstanding territorial dispute that has until now blocked large-scale Japanese aid for the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>According to German and Japanese diplomats, the German offer was conveyed by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher during talks in Tokyo this month, as part of Germany's effort to build a new and closer relationship with Japan as Germany emerges as a dominant political and economic power in Europe.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'space', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Bush Administration has quietly blocked the purchase of missiles, rocket engines, satellites, space reactors, spacecraft and other aerospace technology from the former Soviet Union, Federal and industry officials said last week.</p> <p>The Federal officials said their opposition to the purchases is part of an Administration policy intended to force the Russian space and military industry into such a decline that it poses no future threat to the United States.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A conference of Western and former East bloc nations today discussed for the first time a possible military role as well as a political one for NATO in ending disputes within the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>Later, after a meeting with European Community ministers devoted to Yugoslavia, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the United States would move quickly to recognize the independence of Croatia and Slovenia and would coordinate with European nations the recognition of the other Yugoslav republics, which could come as early as April.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>By warning that the United States has provided "pathetically" insufficient assistance to Russia, former President Richard M. Nixon has stung the Bush Administration and focused attention on an issue that the Administration and Congress have been hesitating to address for months.</p> <p>President Bush's discomfort was evident today when he was asked about Mr. Nixon's critique just before a meeting with Republican leaders. First, Mr. Bush said he and Mr. Nixon had spoken and they were actually in total agreement. Then Mr. Bush said his Administration had already done a great deal -- contradicting Mr. Nixon's whole critique.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Although there has been much talk about building a new political order in the post-cold-war world, the events here in the last few days make clear that a new economic order is also rapidly emerging.</p> <p>Consider these developments in the whirlwind of high-level economic meetings in Washington:</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The four former Soviet republics that have strategic nuclear weapons have reached an agreement that will expedite the ratification of the strategic arms reduction treaty with the United States, Ukraine's President said today.</p> <p>Under the agreement, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan are to act as equal partners in the signing of a new protocol with the United States reconfirming the treaty, known as Start.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin vigorously defended his Government and economic reforms today before a skeptical Congress of People's Deputies and warned the lawmakers not to short-circuit Russia's transformation by diluting presidential power.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin and his chief economic adviser, Yegor T. Gaidar, gave strongly worded speeches that acknowledged some failures in policy and performance, but said the economy was improving and would stabilize by the end of the year.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>When President Boris N. Yeltsin locks horns with the jealous Russian Congress of People's Deputies next week, the likelihood is that he will prevail. The question is at what price.</p> <p>The main issues before the 1,000-odd deputies, whose Congress is the highest legislative authority in Russia, will be the progress of economic change, the powers of the government and a new constitution.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Russia's Cabinet withdrew its resignation today after the Congress of Peoples' Deputies passed a muted declaration of support for the course of radical economic reform.</p> <p>The declaration did not formally undo the resolution approved last Saturday that prompted the resignation in the first place, and a rushed vote left many lawmakers confused about what they were adopting.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The International Monetary Fund said today that the former Soviet Union would need $44 billion in foreign aid this year to help insure that the transition to a market economy does not break down.</p> <p>In presenting the fund's first official estimate of the needs of Russia and the 14 other republics, Michel Camdessus, the I.M.F.'s managing director, confirmed an estimate by the United States and Germany that Russia required about $24 billion and said the 14 other republics would need about $20 billion more in outside help this year.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>After heated and tangled debate, the Russian Congress of People's Deputies passed a resolution this evening that could curtail some of the powers of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>The Congress voted for an amendment that would require Mr. Yeltsin to give up his concurrent post as Prime Minister within 90 days, and to nominate a new Prime Minister subject to parliamentary approval.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The former Soviet republics with battlefield nuclear weapons told the United States today that all of the weapons would be transferred to Russia by July 1, senior Defense Department officials said.</p> <p>The pledges, which followed threats from Ukraine that it was suspending transfers of its nuclear weapons, came in a series of private meetings Defense Secretary Dick Cheney held today at NATO headquarters with senior defense officials from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>The International Monetary Fund said today that it had endorsed Russia's economic reform plan, paving the way for Moscow to receive up to $4 billion in I.M.F. aid over the next year.</p> <p>I.M.F. officials say Russia could begin receiving loans from the fund as early as May, a move that will place the Russian economy to some extent under the stewardship of the I.M.F. It will still require Moscow to meet certain conditions to qualify for the aid, including stringent targets to control the inflation rate and budget deficit.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>After nearly 75 years of deliberate isolation, Russia is expected to rejoin the world economy next week, when it should be formally accepted as a member of the International Monetary Fund. This is occurring at a critical time for President Boris N. Yeltsin, who must make some politically difficult decisions to keep his vaunted economic reform moving.</p> <p>Without these decisions -- primarily to restructure the bulky industrial economy and thereby bring about the inevitable displacement of thousands of workers -- the reform could fail to go far enough to get the billions of dollars of aid being prepared by the I.M.F. and Western nations. Russian leaders know that to receive the much needed Western aid, they will have to submit to I.M.F. discipline and tighten the collective economic belt ever tighter. Credit Is Expanded</p> <p>But already some serious signs of slippage have occurred in Mr. Yeltsin's program of economic reform. Aware that the sudden rise of prices without a similar rise in income has led to widespread grumbling, the Russian Government in recent weeks has begun to loosen up on its tight-money policy.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'law and legislation']	<p>On the 10th day of their tempestuous deliberations in the Kremlin, the 1,000 or so People's Deputies voted to return to their state its historic name, Rossiya, or Russia.</p> <p>A standing ovation greeted the conclusion of an arduous debate over six proposed names ranging from Russian Federation (Russia) to Russia (Russian Federation). The argument ranged from the semantic pedantic to fervent nationalist. Settling finally on simply Russia, to cut short the arguments, the deputies rushed off to give snap interviews about the momentous event.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Showing some irritation toward Washington, Japanese officials said today that it was "inappropriate" and "premature" for President Bush to announce a $24 billion aid package for Russia without having worked out details with Japan.</p> <p>Several officials who insisted on anonymity said they assumed that Mr. Bush had rushed into the announcement this week because of pressure from critics, including former President Richard M. Nixon and Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>The Russian aid package announced last week by the Bush Administration and some Western allies is less concrete and less complete than many officials made it seem, interviews with Administration officials, American lawmakers and senior officials in Europe, Japan and Canada indicate.</p> <p>The officials said eagerness to show support for President Boris N. Yeltsin before his crucial encounter with the Russian Parliament this week accounted for the hasty announcement.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>In the passageway outside the punishment isolation cells, the Soviet prison commandant stopped to argue.</p> <p>Lieut. Col. Nikolai Osin knew from my dossier sent ahead from Moscow that I had visited a Federal maximum security penitentiary in Illinois. He was saying that at least his prison camp in the Urals was better -- wasn't that so?</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's entire Cabinet formally offered to resign today unless an unexpectedly aggressive Parliament halted efforts to scale back the Government's program of economic reform.</p> <p>Any such dilution of the Russian President's program could lead the West to reconsider its offer of billions of dollars in assistance and jeopardize Mr. Yeltsin's plans for economic recovery.</p> <p>Yegor T. Gaidar, the Deputy Prime Minister and chief architect of the economic reforms, said the Cabinet had submitted its resignation en masse, reflecting a growing power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Congress of People's Deputies, the highest legislative authority in Russia.  Keep Working, Yeltsin Says</p> <p>Mr. Gaidar said Mr. Yeltsin had asked his ministers to continue working until the end of the Congress session in the next few days, when he will decide whether to accept their resignations.</p> <p>Their action was in protest against a resolution adopted by the Congress on Saturday ordering Mr. Yeltsin to relinquish the post of Prime Minister and to name a new Government within three months, as well as to make broad changes in the economic program, which came under sharp criticism.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Russian Government and congress officials spent the day today in secretive huddles, seeking ways to retreat from the confrontation that took shape on Saturday when the country's highest elected council adopted a resolution limiting President Boris N. Yeltsin's right to name his officials.</p> <p>After a meeting between senior members of Mr. Yeltsin's Government and the Presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies, the two sides said in a statement that "as a result of constructive discussions, it became possible to narrow the positions and to agree on cooperation in advancing radical economic reform."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council today to impose an immediate and virtually total economic embargo, including a ban on all oil sales, on the rump Yugoslav Government in Belgrade to force it to end Serbian intervention in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p> <p>Britain, France and Belgium, the Council's three European Community members, accepted the American position in consultations at the Security Council today after favoring a weaker plan for imposing sanctions in stages. But Russia and China, two permanent Council members with veto power, which are also Serbia's principal oil suppliers, have appeared reluctant about sanctions. It was not certain that they would accept the embargo plan being pushed by Washington. Medicine and Food Are Exempt</p> <p>The sanctions the United States now wants are as comprehensive as those imposed on Iraq before the Persian Gulf war. They include a ban on trade, with the exception of medicine and approved supplies of food. An embargo on arms deliveries is already in effect.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>At least 13 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia, appear ready to support tough economic sanctions against the Government of Yugoslavia when the issue comes to a vote on Saturday, diplomats said tonight.</p> <p>They said that after a day of consultations, it appeared that four of the five Security Council members with veto power would support the sanctions resolution drafted by the United States, and that the fifth, China, would abstain.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Japanese leaders told Vice President Dan Quayle today that after months of coaxing by the Bush Administration, they would lend and invest as much as $400 million in private enterprises in Eastern and Central Europe. But Japan again refused to send substantial aid to the former Soviet republics until four disputed islands are returned to Japanese hands.</p> <p>Japan's announcement came at the end of a four-day visit here by Mr. Quayle, a trip intended to repair the damage from President Bush's ill-fated trade mission to Tokyo in January and refocus attention on a "global partnership" between the two countries. While both sides declared the trip a success, they also conceded that the most vexing economic issues facing the two countries were deliberately kept off the agenda.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev completed his two-week tour of the United States today with a renewed plea for aid to Russia and praise for the United States as a nation that faced its own problems and set an example for the world.</p> <p>The former Soviet President's last two public appearances were heavily laden with tributes to President John F. Kennedy, who he said had led the way to an end to the cold war in 1963 with his disarmament speech at the American University.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'immigration and refugees', 'atomic weapons', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today that his country had "reached the limit of our capacity" to help the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and he launched an unusually blunt appeal to Japan to offer them more aid.</p> <p>Addressing members of the American Newspaper Publishers Association gathered at the United Nations, Mr. Kohl said that Germany had done as much as it could to help these countries make the transition from Communism to democracy and market economies.  He insisted that the time had come for Japan "to contribute more than it has up to now toward this reform effort."</p>
['foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In an eleventh-hour effort to head off mandatory Security Council sanctions, the leadership of the Serbian-led Yugoslav Government offered today to work with the United Nations to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to speed the flow of emergency relief supplies there.</p> <p>It also asked the 15-nation Security Council to send a delegation to visit the region in order to assess the situation and avoid what it described as "judgments based on assumptions rather than established facts."</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>A senior Russian diplomat received a visitor at his modest embassy with a rueful smile. "You are probably the last to visit us here," he said. "We are moving to our big new embassy today."</p> <p>The new chancellery was designed for a relationship that no longer exists. While there was a Soviet Union, it was this impoverished country's main source of economic, technical and military sustenance. "Now our relations are at bottom," the diplomat said.</p>
['finances', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Rejecting last-minute Serbian appeals for a delay, the Security Council voted overwhelmingly today to follow the Bush Administration's lead and impose tough economic sanctions on the Yugoslav Government in an effort to force Belgrade try to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p> <p>In addition to calling for the establishment of a "security zone" around the Sarajevo airport to allow emergency supplies to be flown into the Bosnian capital, today's resolution committed the Council to "consider immediately, whenever necessary, further steps to achieve a peaceful solution in conformity with relevant resolutions of the Council."  [ Excerpts from the resolution, Page 8. ] U.S. to Seize Yugoslav Assets</p> <p>Although the resolution, which passed with 13 votes in favor and two abstentions, made no specific reference to using force, some Council members are informally discussing the possibility of a naval blockade of the Adriatic ports and closing Bosnian air space to Serbian planes that are supporting forces fighting there. In Sarajevo today, Bosnian Serbs and Muslim Slavs battled at an army barracks, but the Serbs were later reported to have ordered their troops to halt artillery fire..</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Stung by Russian indifference to his American tour and by President Boris N. Yeltsin's disdain for his advice, Mikhail S. Gorbachev has issued a broad attack against the Russian Government, which he said was in danger of losing control.</p> <p>In an interview with the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, the former Soviet President went further than he has since his resignation in December in criticizing the political style of his old rival Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The world's five largest arms suppliers to the Middle East failed to agree this week on how to put into effect a year-old American initiative limiting conventional-weapons sales to the region.</p> <p>After talks on Thursday and Friday, the five countries -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- which supply the Middle East with between 85 and 90 percent of its conventional arms, reported no progress. China opposed a proposal to disclose agreements about the sales of weapons before they are delivered.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was trying to persuade former Soviet republics in recent weeks to give up their nuclear weapons, the only holdout was Kazakhstan. Though it ultimately went along, the largest nation of Central Asia was toying with the idea of using nuclear weapons as political bargaining chips to get international attention.</p> <p>The affairs of Kazakhstan, along with those of the other four former Soviet republics of Central Asia, have been largely overshadowed by developments in republics like Russia or Ukraine, which are better known outside the former Soviet Union. With their Islamic, often anti-Russian populations, moreover, the Central Asia countries -- nicknamed the "stans" after their common suffix -- are emerging from the collapse of the Soviet empire as a world apart from Moscow, policy analysts and area specialists say.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space']	<p>The United States has threatened trade sanctions against Russia and India if the Russians sell missile technology that can help the Indians develop long-range weapons, Indian and Russian officials say.</p> <p>Moscow and New Delhi say the technology, for giant rockets to launch satellites into space, is entirely for peaceful purposes. But Western diplomats here say the sale would violate the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime, an agreement adopted by the United States and other Western countries to block the spread of medium- and long-range missiles that are able to carry nuclear warheads.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends', 'currency', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In his five days of meetings here, Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, sketched a sweeping yet detailed vision of Russia's economic future, including plans to make the ruble convertible by July 1 and to speed up privatization.</p> <p>Mr. Gaidar, who is chief architect of Russia's economic reforms, said he would put an emphasis on increasing oil and agricultural production.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Since the end of the cold war, the military might of the former Soviet empire has actually grown modestly in size just across from this Arctic border outpost. The heavily armored divisions protecting the old Soviet northern flank have not withdrawn as they have in Central Europe.</p> <p>But in all other ways, the cold war seems as dead here as anywhere and security in the Nordic countries facing the old empire to the east is being defined increasingly in nonmilitary terms, like environmental security, economic and social stability in Russia and the improvement of Arctic trade. And if anything, these new security challenges are no less daunting than the old and familiar ones.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space']	<p>India said today that Russia had pledged to honor a commitment made by the former Soviet Union to deliver advanced rocket-engine technology to India despite an American threat to suspend technical cooperation with both Moscow and New Delhi if the deal went through.</p> <p>Both sides, however, indicated that they would allow a review of the program by a committee of experts in order to satisfy the United States that this is not a weapons project.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>The Bush Administration's multibillion-dollar assistance package for Russia is stalled in Congress, as election-year politics and the Los Angeles riots have sapped much of the enthusiasm for the foreign aid legislation.</p> <p>Both Administration and Congressional leaders say the bill will not be passed before President Boris N. Yeltsin's meeting with President Bush on June 15 -- as Mr. Bush had requested in April -- and that they do not know when, or if, it will be approved.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin flew to the Black Sea today to dampen tensions with Ukraine and Georgia. But he had only new threats for Moldovans locked in fresh violence with their secessionist Russian and Ukrainian minority.</p> <p>Arriving in the Russian resort city of Sochi on the northeastern Black Sea coast for talks with President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine, Mr. Yeltsin said the discussions would cover the gamut of disputes between their countries, from economic issues to control of the Crimean Peninsula and the Black Sea Fleet, as well as the region's ethnic conflicts.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'children and youth', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States is helping Russia and other former Soviet republics track and identify prisoners of war held in Afghanistan by Afghan guerrillas who fought the Soviet Army from 1979 to 1989, officials said today.</p> <p>American officials visiting Kabul recently stopped in Moscow and Kiev on the way home to deliver photographs of prisoners obtained from the Afghans, along with other information on P.O.W. cases. These officials say they believe that Afghan militias hold 30 to 50 former Soviet soldiers, most of the from Russia or Ukraine.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia's vote to join United Nations sanctions against Serbia has set off a protest from right-wing nationalists in the Russian Parliament, who are accusing the Government of "betraying" their Slavic brothers and selling out to "pro-American interests" in Europe.</p> <p>Moscow's about-face on Yugoslavia has proved to be a litmus test not only of Russia's longstanding historical and cultural ties to Serbia, but also of the perception in some political circles here that Russia has had to fall in line behind the West's policy as the price for Western credits and aid.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic energy', 'law and legislation']	<p>Like other post-totalitarian societies before it, Russia has fallen heir to a vast trove of secrets from a fallen dictatorship, a legacy as intriguing and instructive as it is deeply troubling.</p> <p>Almost daily the dark secrets trickle out: a plea from the censors that they need new equipment to monitor the modems and faxes of foreign correspondents, an order from the Central Committee to arm Palestinian terrorists or to send money to the Polish Communist Party as recently as October 1990.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>It is a year now since Boris N. Yeltsin became the first elected President of Russia, and the reviews are as diverse as the extraordinary chain of events that transformed him from the maverick leader of a Soviet republic to the master of the Kremlin.</p> <p>Though he travels widely and gives frequent interviews, the burly, 61-year-old President remains a complex and elusive figure. He is still enormously popular at home, but abroad his stiff and formal demeanor have denied him the celebrity status enjoyed by his archrival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  In Wake of Gorbachev</p> <p>That contrast is certain to hang over Mr. Yeltsin's visit to the United States starting Monday, which comes in the wake of Mr. Gorbachev's successful voyage. The trip is Mr. Yeltsin's second to the United States as Russia's President and his first full-dress summit meeting, and he will have the rare honor of addressing a joint meeting of Congress.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>When President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Bush meet on Tuesday, they will seek to cement Washington's budding friendship with the new Russian nation in two ways: through arms control and by bolstering Russia's economic reforms.</p> <p>Both efforts are needed, Administration officials say, because if Russia's painful transition to a Western-style market economy fails, a fledgling democracy could be snuffed out and a hostile dictator could come to power.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Although the biggest news out of this week's summit meeting was the agreement to sharply reduce American and Russian nuclear arsenals, the centerpiece turned out to be economic relations between the two former rivals.</p> <p>In effect, these two days marked the moment when the currency of American-Russian relations shifted from warheads to dollars. Stripped to its essence, what President Boris N. Yeltsin did this week was promise Mr. Bush that Russia would trash thousands of warheads in exchange for long-promised trade privileges, a bilateral investment treaty, removal of cold-war trade barriers and the hope of lucrative American investment and quick Congressional approval of a Russian aid package.</p>
['elections', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In olden times, we hard-liners said: Don't trust the Russians. Fight them every step of the way until the free human spirit wins.</p> <p>The soft-liners said: Accommodate. Try to understand their fear of us, and some peaceful day the two systems will converge.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>On a day that the United States gave Russia a set of trade incentives to boost its struggling economy, President Boris N. Yeltsin swept through official Washington like a conquering hero today and announced that he was deactivating the most potent nuclear missiles aimed at America.</p> <p>Amid chants of "Boris, Boris, Boris!" reverberating through the House of Representatives chamber, Mr. Yeltsin stirred Congress to 13 standing ovations as he vowed that the "idol of Communism" had "collapsed, never to rise again."  [ Excerpts, page A18. ]</p>
['space', 'russia-international relations-us', 'space stations']	<p>Presidents Bush and Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to more cooperation between the world's two major spacefaring nations, including arrangements for American and Russian astronauts to fly aboard the other nation's spacecraft and for studying how Russian technology can be incorporated into the proposed international space station and other projects.</p> <p>The United States and Russia decided to complete plans for an astronaut exchange, which had been agreed upon before the collapse of the former Soviet Union but has been in limbo since. They also agreed to begin planning for a United States space shuttle to meet and dock with the Russian space station Mir in 1994 or 1995.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>A mere two days in Washington, and Boris N. Yeltsin already has some Americans muttering, "Mikhail who?"</p> <p>This Russian-American summit meeting has in many ways been Mr. Yeltsin's cotillion -- his debut as a world leader -- and in the minds of many here he has demonstrated that he knows all the steps mastered by the President of the old Soviet Union, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. In the process, he seems to have gained a purchase on the title that Mr. Gorbachev inherited, but which Mr. Yeltsin has had to earn through hard labor: that of a global figure.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>With oratory that thrilled even Congressional critics of aid, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia appeared today to have virtually eliminated an important obstacle to passage of an aid program for the former Soviet republics.</p> <p>After his speech at a joint meeting of Congress interrupted by standing ovations, legislative leaders said they thought that Mr. Yeltsin had persuaded even skeptical lawmakers of his determination to help find missing American servicemen, and had thus won vital votes for the American portion of a $24 billion international assistance package for former Soviet republics.</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>Another cold-war assumption about the way of the world has softly crumbled here with a state visit by President F. W. de Klerk of South Africa. He made it to Moscow even before Nelson Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, which Moscow has long supported.</p> <p>South Africa and the Soviet Union were two promontories over one of the cold war world's greatest rifts. Moscow openly backed Mr. Mandela and the then-outlawed African National Congress, while Pretoria, despite its apartheid system of strict racial segregation, sought American and Western aid for its fierce anti-Communism.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, failed to conclude an agreement today on how to cut the number of nuclear warheads below the levels set in the recently signed strategic arms reduction treaty.</p> <p>But the two said they would keep trying in the week remaining before the next Russian-American summit meeting.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Some nine months after gaining independence from Moscow, the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia remain stunted and struggling, their fledgling political and economic institutions still seeking stability.</p> <p>But in this city, founded in 1201, as in the nearby capitals of Tallinn and Vilnius, the months since the break with Moscow have produced a sometimes bewildering rush of change and new possibilities.</p>
['foreign aid', 'law and legislation']	<p>The concept of "linkage" used to be at the center of negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union, as concessions on one issue often had to be compensated by the other side's backing down somewhere else.</p> <p>The idea now may be passe diplomatically. But it is at the heart of political dealings between President Bush and House Democrats over aid to the nations of the former Soviet Union. The Democrats insist they won't help Russia and the rest if President Bush won't support their efforts to help Americans.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Only hours after the leader of Georgia, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, survived an apparent coup attempt, he and President Boris N. Yeltsin signed an agreement today to end the fighting in the rebellious Georgian province of South Ossetia.</p> <p>Immediately after the signing, Mr. Yeltsin flew off to Turkey for a meeting in which ethnic fighting between Azerbaijanis and Armenians is expected to be the dominant issue.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Administration officials said today that they would press President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring Russia's budget deficit under control to help enable Moscow to sign an economic reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>If Russia controls its deficit, reins in its money supply and moves to make the ruble convertible, then the Administration will press the I.M.F. not to delay an agreement because of concerns about details, the officials added.</p>
['foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'elections', 'treaties', 'war and revolution']	<p>On the face of it, the sweeping arms agreement announced today by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia seems precisely the kind of political medicine Mr. Bush needs.</p> <p>It displays Mr. Bush in his preferred role of accomplished international negotiator and peacemaker, which since the Persian Gulf war has been gradually eclipsed, in terms of public opinion, by concerns about health care, jobs, education, the environment and the credibility of politicians. Nuclear disarmament is obviously an easier sell than sluggish economic growth.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>The latest Russian-American arms control agreement not only reduces their total nuclear arsenals from about 22,500 warheads to 7,000, but also does so in a way that eliminates the most threatening Russian nuclear weapons while allowing the United States to maintain its most advanced missiles, American officials and arms control experts said today.</p> <p>"We are talking about a very good deal," said Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Association. "On paper, it looks like the two forces will be reduced equally, but in fact the Russians will be giving up the backbone of their arsenal -- land-based multiple warheaded missiles -- while we will be retaining the area of our greatest strength, sea-based ballistic missiles."</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'law and legislation', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced an agreement today that not only sharply reduces their stocks of long-range-missile warheads, but also eliminates all multiple-warhead missiles based on land, the core of the old Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>The accord was announced by the leaders in the White House Rose Garden just hours after Mr. Yeltsin began the first state visit to Washington by a Russian President. It must still be translated into a formal treaty, which United States officials said could be done within three months, then approved by the United States Senate and the Russian Parliament.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties', 'public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Like so many of the drastic changes taking place in Russia, the agreement to sharply reduce the strategic arsenals of Russia and the United States is likely to be welcomed for the new era it heralds and resented for the collapse of empire it confirms.</p> <p>The agreement announced by Presidents Bush and Boris N. Yeltsin on the first full day of the Russian leader's visit to Washington seemed to come as a major surprise. None of the newspapers here had predicted it, and none of the evening news programs had any advance notice.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>Following are excerpts from statements and a brief news conference by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who spoke through an interpreter: BUSH STATEMENT</p> <p>Mr. President, let me just say that I'm pleased to announce that President Yeltsin and I have just reached an extraordinary agreement on two areas of vital importance to our countries and to the world. First, we have agreed on far-reaching new strategic arms reductions. Building on the agreement reached with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, our two countries are now agreeing to even further dramatic strategic arms reductions substantially below the levels determined by Start.</p>
['war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told a Senate committee in a letter today that the Soviet Union detained and imprisoned American servicemen during World War II, when the two countries were allies, and afterward, often in violation of conventions governing prisoners of war. He also said Soviet officials had lied to the United States about the fate of missing Americans.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's letter, released in translation by the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, acknowledged for the first time that nine American aircraft had been shot down over the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war in the 1950's and that there had been survivors.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia and the United States announced today that they had narrowed their differences over an agreement to radically reduce their nuclear arsenals. But they said further negotiations would be necessary at next week's summit meeting between President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d flew to London today and met his Russian counterpart, Andrei V. Kozyrev, for three and a half hours of talks that were scheduled at the last minute in an effort to wrap up a new arms accord before the summit meeting. But the two men emerged to say that though both sides had offered new compromises, gaps still remained.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Eleven nations of the Balkan Peninsula and the former Soviet Union joined today in a group for economic cooperation.</p> <p>In a solemn ceremony, Presidents Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine, Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia and Prime Ministers Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece signed the Declaration of Black Sea Economic Cooperation.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The introduction of a tough troika of former Soviet industrial managers into Boris N. Yeltsin's Government in the past two weeks has stirred a new round of speculation about the Russian President's true intentions.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin has argued that the managers, all with solid track records both in industry and in reform politics, were needed to bring a critical economic sector into the Government as it moves toward the complex next stage of privatization and conversion.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>A backlash against President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reforms is forcing a delay of several months, and perhaps much longer, in the approval of an aid package intended to give Russia at least $24 billion in Western assistance, Russian and American officials say.</p> <p>The delay comes as there are strong signs in Washington that Congress has lost its enthusiasm for giving money to Russia to help finance the International Monetary Fund package that is threatened by the Moscow backlash.</p>
['foreign aid', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Of the many things that Russia lacks, peanut butter is one. To be sure, no one here knew they were missing it. But this week, in a gesture of self-interested humanitarian aid, the National Peanut Council of America presented this hungry nation with its first peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich.</p> <p>The formal tasting took place at the Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, a centerpiece of gilded fountains, giant airships and other monuments of the Soviet era. The first verdict by a troupe from the Moscow Children's Theater was that peanut butter -- or arakhisovoye maslo -- was "on the salty side." No one complained about it sticking to the roof of his mouth.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Ambassador Robert S. Strauss says he is planning to spend several weeks in Washington to "work the phones" there until the Bush Administration's Russian aid package "is out of the way."</p> <p>Mr. Strauss, a Texas Democrat with a reputation as a dealmaker, said Friday at a briefing before his departure today that he recognizes the difficulties members of Congress have in voting for foreign aid in an election year, and that he believes he can spend the next few weeks acting as a nonpartisan lobbyist for the Russian aid package, which passed the Senate last week but is facing a tougher time in the House. Democrats Seek 'Cover'</p> <p>He said that he thought House Democrats favored the bill, but that they wanted enough Republican votes to provide "political cover" in an election year.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A Russian-Georgian peacekeeping force wearing United Nations blue began operations today to stop the fighting in the South Ossetia region of Georgia.</p> <p>It was the first such peacekeeping effort in the former Soviet Union, which has been ripped by conflict between long-suppressed nationalities.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The leaders of seven major industrial democracies warned the belligerents in Bosnia and Herzegovina today that they would support United Nations-backed military action if it became necessary to get aid through to civilians in Sarajevo and other parts of the war-torn country.</p> <p>The leaders issued a strong warning to the leaders of Serbia and of the armies it controls that further fighting was unacceptable. Resurgent nationalism and ethnic tensions there and in parts of the former Soviet Union, they said, were causing "death, destruction, and widespread dislocation of innocent people."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>The economic summit meetings of the seven industrial democracies, begun 17 years ago in France, are facing a crisis of credibility. With all the talk, pomp and expense, accompanied this year by scant action, people are asking: Where's the beef?</p> <p>The nearest thing, it seemed, was President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. In an unusual twist, the head of an economy in virtually complete chaos, with an "inflation rate" of 640 percent in the past four months, was welcomed today by the Group of Seven as a potential savior.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'news and news media']	<p>On Friday, the Russian Parliament voted to take over Izvestia, an independent newspaper with 3.8 million readers that once was an organ of the Soviet Government. On Saturday, President Boris N. Yeltsin said he would step into the fight as a guarantor of the freedom of the press.</p> <p>Today, Izvestia appeared with three pages devoted to this latest crisis of nerves.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>The Senate approved today a long-delayed aid package to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that authorizes nearly $1 billion in new spending and billions of dollars in credits and loans, all conditioned on continued movement toward democracy and a free market.</p> <p>By a 76-to-20 vote, the Senate passed a bill that supporters said established a new framework for friendly relations between Washington and its former cold-war foes. The House is expected to take up a similar package later this month.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The Russian Foreign Minister has caused a stir in Moscow by his warning this week that Communist and nationalist forces are manipulating the military in an effort to destabilize or overthrow the democratic Government here.</p> <p>The minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, speaking to Izvestia, warned that pressure for the Russian Army to intervene in support of Russian-speakers living outside Russia's borders, in hotspots like Moldova and South Ossetia, was being orchestrated by politicians opposed to President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>A plan from the new chairman of the Russian Central Bank to reduce the enormous debt burden carried by state industries has deepened the dispute inside the Government over how sharply to curb deficit spending.</p> <p>The plan, proposed last week by the chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, was reportedly the subject of a heated discussion today by top economic officials, the news agency Interfax said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Eleven months after the failed Communist coup and seven months after the breakup of the Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin's reformist Government is in retreat and its radical economic plan is faltering.</p> <p>There is a growing sense that the administration of Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who designed Russia's economic reform plan, miscalculated its plans and has lost its authority and bearings. Indications are that the radical reformers are rapidly losing ground to tough directors and managers of state-owned industries who demand a far slower pace of change.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>On the eve of celebrations for the anniversary of last year's failed coup d'etat, President Boris N. Yeltsin went on television tonight with details of a privatization program that will provide vouchers worth 10,000 rubles (just over $60) for each man, woman and child in Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, back from a two-week vacation, gave a somber, even defensive assessment of his economic reforms. "Some people say we plunged into the stream before learning to swim," he said. "But we have not choked, nor have we drowned."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>For seven decades this ancient city, renamed Gorky by the Bolsheviks, led the Soviet Union in making weapons of destruction. Now a new breed of bold leaders hopes that as Nizhny Novgorod once again the city can lead Russia -- this time, into a new phase of economic reform.</p> <p>From offices in the medieval citadel, a brash young Governor, a Mayor who used to fight white-collar crime and a crusading economist, backed by some imported Western talent, are plotting an ambitious and independent economic path that they believe could provide a model for the stalled reforms of Moscow, 250 miles to the west.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>A year after his triumphant victory over the plotters of a hard-line coup, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he -- unlike his old rival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- is in no danger of being thrown from power, either by his friends or by his enemies.</p> <p>"I have always said, and I repeat it today, that there is no chance of a putsch No. 2," Mr. Yeltsin said at a news conference, recalling with some relish that the Soviet President's fall had come at the hands of his own hand-picked associates.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The main office building of the Bolshevik factory, part of a huge military-industrial concern, is built from the shell of a former church. On the wall outside is a plaque to the factory's true patron saint, Marshal Dmitri F. Ustinov.</p> <p>Marshal Ustinov, who was Soviet Defense Minister when he died in 1984, was known as "Mr. Military-Industrial Complex." This factory, which he directed from 1938 to 1941, before Stalin named him Armaments Commissar in World War II, is his monument.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>After 45 years of voting for foreign aid to combat the Soviet Union, the House voted today to provide billions of dollars in assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.</p> <p>The action assures Congressional approval of an aid package that President Bush has called essential to the post-cold-war world and that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told Congress in June would help guarantee the success of his efforts to nourish democratic and economic reform.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Discarding another vestige of the cold war, Russia and the United States announced today the lifting of all restrictions on travel by each other's journalists and business people.</p> <p>In effect, the agreement made it possible for American reporters and trade representatives to roam the far reaches of the vast Russian land for the first time in more than five decades.</p>
['foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>A quarrel between the United States and Russia, on one side, and Germany, on the other, is snarling efforts of finance ministers here to postpone the repayment of the former Soviet Union's $70 billion foreign debt, senior financial officials here said today.</p> <p>Russian officials, here for the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, want to postpone for at least five years their repayments of interest and principal. But German officials are resisting. Half the debt is owed to German banks and German Government agencies, while very little is owed to American banks or Federal agencies here.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>Most countries responded to the collapse of Soviet Communism last year by abandoning years of hostility to support the new Government in Moscow. Japan's response was more complex: the Government insisted that, until a World War II territorial dispute was resolved, Japan would not recognize that anything had really changed in Moscow.</p> <p>Neither the passage of time nor the end of the cold war has softened Japan's insistence that it was robbed by Stalin. The contested property is a group of bleak, lightly populated islands in the far north. Until they are returned, Japan insists it will not normalize relations with Russia or even sign a peace treaty for World War II.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Robert M. Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, will visit Moscow this fall to discuss, among other issues, potential cooperation with Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>The visit by Mr. Gates is considered symbolically important because it would be the first visit to Moscow by the highest-ranking United States intelligence official.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>As the Soviet welfare system collapses, the feminization of poverty may become the new Russia's largest and cruelest problem.</p> <p>In Moscow, 70 percent of the newly unemployed are women between the ages of 45 and 55. When I visited one of Moscow's recently established unemployment offices this summer, women in line described the kind of discrimination they now face in the job market. Some were turned away because they were too old -- in their 40's. Others had been told that their maternal responsibilities made them unreliable workers.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The United States announced yesterday that it had agreed in principle to buy billions of dollars' worth of bomb-grade uranium from scrapped Soviet nuclear arms in an attempt to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents or theft.</p> <p>The agreement, which would require the formal approval of both Governments, calls for highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear arms to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel. It would be the first such agreement, and, if approved, would be a major step to reducing the dangers that made the cold war so unnerving.</p>
['treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'law and legislation']	<p>Irritated by Moscow's failure to provide information about its secret biological weapons program, the Bush Administration asked Russia today to demonstrate that it has ended the program.</p> <p>Administration officials said they did not question the commitment of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to end the manufacture or stockpiling of these weapons. But they said they believed that the political authorities in Moscow were having difficulty getting the Russian military to divulge details about a program that violated the 1972 biological-warfare treaty.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>After voluntarily pulling out of Afghanistan and Eastern Europe and watching their huge empire crumble, the Russians suddenly drew the line at four obscure islands off Japan -- alienating, in the process, a major potential donor.</p> <p>That, at least, was the impression on Wednesday, when President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly postponed his trip to Japan after a wave of public discontent made it virtually impossible for him to grant Tokyo even a tentative pledge of eventual sovereignty over a group of islands in the Kurile chain that the Soviet Union captured in the closing days of World War II.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia appealed to the United Nations today to consider setting up international trusteeships to oversee the move to independence by former Soviet non-Slavic republics to prevent them from discriminating against minorities.</p> <p>"Previously, victims of totalitarian regimes and ideologies needed protection," Mr. Kozyrev told the General Assembly. "Today, ever more often one needs to counter aggressive nationalism that emerges as a new global threat."</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>With a decade of negotiations and an era of superpower rivalry gone by, the Senate endorsed an arms control treaty today that sharply reduces the numbers of long-range nuclear weapons held by the United States and four republics of the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>Even greater cuts in nuclear arms are already planned under a later agreement reached last June by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. That agreement, currently being translated into treaty language, would cut warheads to 3,000 in the Russian arsenal and 3,500 in the American one, less than a third of today's levels.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'news and news media']	<p>In an atmosphere of mounting political confrontation, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called today for the disbanding of the National Salvation Front, an opposition group made up of ultra-nationalists and old-guard Communists that held its founding congress last weekend.</p> <p>At a meeting with top officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Yeltsin said the front was both unconstitutional and politically destabilizing, and declared its activities "inadmissable."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The debate over Russia's future has broken out into the open with a vengeance as an increasingly vocal opposition prepares for a bitter battle over President Boris N. Yeltsin's program of economic reform.</p> <p>Acting in open defiance of the Russian leader, the Parliament's conservative majority today rebuffed his appeal for a postponement of the Congress of People's Deputies, the country's top legislative body, which is to convene on Dec. 1. By delaying the session until spring, Mr. Yeltsin had hoped to head off a certain showdown over the fate of the Government as his own broad authority to rule by decree expires.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Bush said today that the United States was ready to use its military forces to impose a ban on combat flights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a step that could introduce American air power into the Balkan war for the first time.</p> <p>In a written statement issued by the White House, Mr. Bush said he was seeking a United Nations resolution banning all flights in Bosnian airspace except those authorized by the world body. He said Serbian bombing attacks showed a "flagrant disregard for human life."  [ Excerpts, page 5. ]</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>A day after President Boris N. Yeltsin suspended a pullout of Russian troops, the independent Baltic states reacted with anger and dismay today and new questions were raised in the West regarding aid to Moscow and Russia's long-term intentions in the Baltics.</p> <p>A spokesman from NATO headquarters in Brussels urged Russia not to delay the pullout, despite the logistical difficulties of housing returning troops.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Campaigning for his embattled reforms two weeks before a crucial session of the Russian legislature, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out today at the political forces ranged against him.</p> <p>"Of late, there has been an unbridled campaign in the country to fire political hysteria," Mr. Yeltsin said before the powerful lobby of industrial managers.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Returning from 16 months as Ambassador in Moscow, first to the Soviet Union and then to Russia, reminds me again that people change their minds. This is true in the United States and in Russia.</p> <p>In my lifetime, Americans have changed their minds about Prohibition, isolationism and racial and sexual equality. They have changed their minds several times about the role of government in the economy and society. The ebb and flow of changing minds is what politics and government are all about.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Until this year, the diamonds mined here at the giant Peace pit, dug a quarter-mile deep into the harsh Siberian landscape, have been more a source of misery than of wealth for the residents of Yakutia, the largest and arguably the richest of Russia's autonomous regions.</p> <p>Yakutia's diamonds, which account for 99 percent of Russia's production and one-fourth of the world's, were discovered here in 1957. But Mirny, the hub of the diamond industry, started to pave its roads only five years ago, and still has 40 percent of them to go. Despite winter temperatures of 40 degrees below zero, many residents still live in wooden huts where, as one inhabitant put it, all the facilities are outside except the beds, and the only running water comes in spring when the snow melts.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The Peace Corps is sending its first volunteers to Russia this week. On Friday, 102 business executives and graduates of business schools will arrive in Moscow for three months of language training before being assigned to small business centers throughout Russia.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>South Korea, which granted and then cut off $3 billion in economic assistance to the former Soviet Union, is preparing to resume its aid to Russia, Government officials said today.</p> <p>The formal announcement of the restoration of the aid package will be made when President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia visits here for three days starting on Wednesday.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'treaties', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told his top military leaders today that he would keep the total military budget at last year's level, but would increase spending on arms and equipment 10 percent.</p> <p>That plan presumably offered a measure of reassurance to the armed forces, which have been disoriented and demoralized by the collapse of the Soviet Union and a radical drop in military spending. But Mr. Yeltsin also assailed the officers for moving far too slowly in reorganizing and reducing the vast Soviet military machine, and he demanded that they crack down on arms pilferage and corruption.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>LOOKING LIKE POOH Bear in the lions' den, Yegor Timurovich Gaidar, the Acting Prime Minister of Russia, strode to the podium to face his harshest audience, the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament chosen 21 months before the Soviet Union collapsed.</p> <p>Gaidar, only 36 years old, was sweating, clearly nervous. The Parliament had come back into session this day, Sept. 22, after a summer of increasingly bitter denunciations of Gaidar and his Government, which is dominated by young, westernized economists like himself.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>A year ago, the stories out of Moscow were full of dark warnings about starvation, destitution, chaos and coups as the Soviet Union lurched toward its end.</p> <p>This has not been a wonderful year for the Russian economy, as an inexperienced Government tries to manage an extraordinary transition to a capitalistic system. There is more poverty, purchasing power is down, industrial production has dropped to 75 percent of what it was a year ago, inflation is running at about 25 percent a month and the ruble is hovering around 450 to the dollar, compared with 135 at the end of June.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>Concluding a three-day visit here, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia promised today to put pressure on North Korea to give up its effort to develop nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Speaking at a news conference with President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia had already stopped supplying North Korea with nuclear technology and materials. Without Russian help, he said, North Korea would not be able to develop nuclear arms.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>When Robert S. Strauss arrived here to take up his post as the United States Ambassador, there was a coup going on, so on the drive in from the airport he settled back for a nap. "There won't be much time to sleep later on," he explained to his surprised wife.</p> <p>Leaving Moscow a tempestuous 15 months later, Mr. Strauss said he was still not sure when there would be rest. But he said he was convinced that if Russia could hang tough through an additional 18 to 24 months without an explosion, the country's economic crisis would begin to lift.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'television', 'news and news media']	<p>Having set off a storm of criticism by dismissing the outspoken chief of central television, President Boris N. Yeltsin took another step today toward appeasing his opposition by accepting the resignation of his pugnacious Information Minister.</p> <p>Coming only days before an important session of Russia's legislature, Mr. Yeltsin's sudden dismissal of two men known for their support of openness in the press suggested to many today that he was so deeply committed to working out a compromise with the conservative legislators to achieve qualified support of his economic reform plan that he was willing to appear less than dedicated to an independent press and television.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'treaties', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>Looking to win a firm show of Western backing, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia swept through London today, signing a flurry of broad agreements on economic and political cooperation with Britain and then making a fresh appeal to the West to do more to ease his country's crippling burden of debt.</p> <p>Closing the first day of a two-day visit, Mr. Yeltsin told a group of London bankers and business people that if Moscow is to find a way out of its cash crisis, money borrowed by the Soviet Union in its last 11 months of existence must be included in any debt-rescheduling plan.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>A few days after Lithuania's former Communists surged ahead in the first round of elections for a new parliament, pranksters put up a mock Lenin statue, made of cardboard with Russian rubles pinned on its chest, in what used to be Lenin Square.</p> <p>The figure draw a crowd of agitated citizens ready to dissect the elections on Oct. 25 for signs that Lithuania, once again, is setting a trend.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Lithuanian voters angry at economic difficulties and cold apartments have repudiated the Sajudis movement that brought them independence, giving a party of former Communists a working majority in a new Parliament.</p> <p>After a stinging defeat on Sunday in a second, runoff round of elections for Parliament, the bitter leader of the defeated party, Vytautas Landsbergis, who announced independence in March 1990, warned that "we are moving back toward the one-party rule we saw before 1988."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Last year at Christmas time, Boris N. Yeltsin moved into the Kremlin, taking over the offices and much of the power of his old rival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p> <p>Nearly a year later, as the Kremlin's ancient walls echoed with another power struggle, the Russian President appeared strangely isolated and humiliated by a rambunctious conservative opposition at the Congress of People's Deputies.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'treaties']	<p>Saying he needed to "restore order" and protect the reformist core of Russia's Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin cut short his visit to China this morning and headed back to Moscow.</p> <p>His new Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, whom Mr. Yeltsin chose this week after parliamentary pressure forced him to abandon acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, was on his own visit to Kazakhstan, and Moscow itself seemed quiet early this morning.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>The plight of the 25 million Russians outside of Russia has become a foreign policy concern of President Boris Yeltsin's Government. In this issue are the seeds of another crisis more dangerous than the breakup of Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Estonia has passed and Latvia has proposed discriminatory citizenship laws requiring Russians, as well as other ethnic minorities, to go through a difficult naturalization process during which they cannot vote, own property or hold certain jobs.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The debates of Russia's Congress of Peoples' Deputies, the country's highest legislative body, can range from the vituperative to the petulant, from the cogent to the perverse. But among the deputies who have come from all over the vast Russian Federation, many are sensible and relatively businesslike, eager to influence the Government, not undermine it, and to represent the hopes and fears of their constituents.</p> <p>Discussions with deputies this week, as the television cameras have focused on speeches by President Boris N. Yeltsin and his acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, reveal a general sobermindedness about Russia's problems and a distaste, as Deputy Nikolai A. Cherepkov of Chelyabinsk put it, "for the clowns who live only for the microphone and the television camera."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>Large-scale foreign economic and financial aid to Russia, which many economists still believe is essential for a transformation to a market economy, has been pushed off the international agenda by political uncertainties here and by a global recession that affects potential donors.</p> <p>The political struggle in Russia between pro-market forces, led by President Boris N. Yeltsin, and legislators who resist the painful aspects of change leaves many Western investors and diplomats skeptical about investing large amounts.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'law and legislation']	<p>A compromise between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his legislative opposition, presented with much drama and some confusion late Saturday, holds the promise of an end to Russia's long constitutional crisis and the development of more ordinary democratic politics, some Government officials and senior Western diplomats said today.</p> <p>By scheduling a popular referendum on major constitutional questions for April 11, the country's squabbling leaders have allowed the people of Russia a crucial say in their future that was previously denied to them.  Yeltsin Still Holds Reins</p> <p>In the meantime, the status quo before this venomous session of the Congress of People's Deputies began on Dec. 1 will essentially be restored, with Mr. Yeltsin keeping his powers of decree over economic policy and very possibly keeping his Acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The Russian Congress voted today against naming Yegor T. Gaidar as Prime Minister, issuing an embarrassing rebuff to President Boris N. Yeltsin but evidently leaving Mr. Gaidar and his team at the helm of Russia's economic reforms for at least another three months.</p> <p>The secret ballot was 467 for Mr. Gaidar and 486 against. To be approved, he would have needed 521 votes. But deputies from all sides agreed that Mr. Yeltsin still had the authority to retain Mr. Gaidar as Acting Prime Minister, the position he now holds.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>In a last-ditch push to conclude a nuclear arms treaty before he leaves office next month, President Bush has agreed to compromise on two of the remaining three hurdles to an agreement, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said today.</p> <p>Mr. Eagleburger disclosed the Administration's willingness to compromise in remarks to reporters today en route to Geneva, where he will meet on Monday with senior Russian officials.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>Looking down into the abyss of hyperinflation a condition that bred totalitarianism in Germany -- Russian leaders, old and new, are now deciding which economic model to follow.</p> <p>One model is Western-style capitalism that couples political democracy with free markets. The Poles and Czechs, having accepted the hardship of such "shock therapy," are making this dual freedom work.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'international trade and world market', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As Bill Clinton prepares for inauguration, his Presidency already seems haunted by the great issue he pointedly avoided in the campaign -- national security and foreign policy. History will judge the Bush Administration's missed opportunities and neglect of a revolutionary world as an almost epic blunder, leaving a legacy of contradiction and hazard.</p> <p>Unless the new Administration develops a coherent view of a transformed world and of America's new international interest, role and purpose, there will be no more than a marginal, politically arbitrary reapportionment of huge national security budgets, which are now largely wasted on cold war vestiges yet are essential to finance domestic revival and deficit reduction. The same capricious politics are likely to raid non-military international spending or exploit trade tensions for short-run advantage, all with insidious effect.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>After announcing he will meet with President President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on Saturday, President Bush began a foreign trip Wednesday to Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Russia on what he called a purely humanitarian -- and not personal -- mission of good will.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia have agreed to hold a summit meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi early in January if an arms control treaty can be completed by then, the White House said today.</p> <p>Mr. Bush called Mr. Yeltsin this morning to discuss the accord. Afterward, a senior Administration official said that Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger would leave Washington on Sunday for a meeting in Geneva with Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to try to thrash out the remaining differences.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament']	<p>In the bad old days of the Soviet Union, a frequent answer to the question "What's going on?" was "Nobody knows." Still, somebody usually knew. But now, in Russia, nobody really does know. Least of all experts in the West.</p> <p>Some obscure older-style bureaucrat named Viktor Chernomyrdin replaces Yegor Gaidar, the West's reformist darling, as Prime Minister. One day President Boris Yeltsin looks like a master democratic strategist; the next day he doesn't seem to have a clue. The Russian Foreign Minister gives a frightening hard-line speech at an important international conference -- then an hour later says it was all a joke. The Russian economy shows promise in places, but mostly it's fallen into a deep depression, ripe for repression.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Outmaneuvered in the end by the hostile Russian Congress, President Boris N. Yeltsin today surrendered Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect and symbol of his economic program, and in his stead named a veteran manager of the state energy sector to be Prime Minister.</p> <p>The stunning reversal, and the question mark it raised over the continuation of the already limping program of economic change, concluded a two-week power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the bellicose Congress of People's Deputies, during which the tide of battle shifted frequently and furiously.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Russian Foreign Minister shocked an international conference today with a blustering anti-Western speech that sounded as if it had been given at the height of the cold war.</p> <p>For nearly a half hour, senior diplomats rushed around, conferring with each other on what had seemed a drastic shift in Moscow's policy enunciated by the Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. Even members of his own delegation said they had been caught unawares.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>By a hair's breadth, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today survived the most serious challenge yet mounted by hard-line opponents in Parliament intent on altering the course of his economic changes and curbing his powers.</p> <p>In secret balloting, the country's highest-ranking legislative body fell a few votes short of adopting constitutional amendments that would have diluted Mr. Yeltsin's control over the Government and given new powers to a Parliament dominated by an increasingly militant majority of hard-liners.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>After five months of intense and sometimes emotional testimony, Russia's highest court today upheld President Boris N. Yeltsin's ban on the Communist Party but sidestepped any broad condemnation of the still potent legacy of Soviet Communism.</p> <p>The 13-member Constitutional Court found that Mr. Yeltsin's decrees banning the Soviet and Russian Communist parties after the aborted putsch of August 1991 were basically sound. But it ruled that the issue of property was for civil courts to decide, and that low-level party units were legitimate.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>From the political turmoil in Russia in recent days, two men have emerged with enhanced influence: Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the new and relatively unknown Prime Minister, who has spent most of his life in the oil and gas industry, and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, who has burst from obscurity to make his job of Speaker of the legislature into a new power center.</p> <p>In separate news conferences today, both appealed for calm and consensus, but in radically different tones.</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>Russia's new economics czar, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, takes office just as President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government is preparing to ask the industrial nations to postpone collection of $18 billion that should have been repaid this year but was not. Talks on rescheduling the debt reopen tomorrow in Paris.</p> <p>Bush Administration officials and bankers said that Mr. Chernomyrdin's appointment as Prime Minister, replacing Yegor T. Gaidar, is not likely to change the outcome of the negotiations. "We will continue to support debt rescheduling," one Administration official said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, in a brief but sharp address to an increasingly fractious Congress of People's Deputies, urged lawmakers today not to approve a set of constitutional amendments that he said would weaken the Government, endanger economic reform and lead the country to anarchy.</p> <p>The Congress, the country's highest legislative body, is set to vote on Saturday in secret balloting on changes to the Constitution that would require the President to submit the nomination and dismissal of top Cabinet ministers to Parliament for approval.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'law and legislation', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, opening a session of the Russian Congress, acknowledged today that his economic changes were shriveling the living standards of most Russians. But he insisted that a change in course was not the answer.</p> <p>In a speech to 1,041 deputies in the glittering Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr. Yeltsin asked for "a respite of a year to a year and a half" from the disputes over his program, but preliminary skirmishes suggested that the session would not pass peacefully.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Democracy is making an impact on the Great Kremlin Palace, once used by Russian czars as their Moscow residence and by the Communists for their wooden imitation of a parliament.</p> <p>Now, when Russian politicians are just getting the hang of pressure groups, hallway lobbying and wheeling and dealing, the place resembles a high-school gym at election time.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In completing a new strategic arms treaty, Washington and Moscow have for the first time agreed to bring their strategic nuclear arsenals into line with their new cooperative relationship.</p> <p>Throughout the cold war, each side amassed an expanding arsenal of strategic weapons. But the agreement will drastically cut the size of each side's arsenal and, most important of all, ban the most threatening type of nuclear weapon -- the land-based missile with multiple warheads. Removing the Hair Trigger</p> <p>Despite the waning of the nuclear threat brought about by the end of the cold war, the agreement on the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was not inevitable. And it was a testimony to the difficulty of the Start II negotiations that the final hurdles were not overcome until this week, six months after President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that they had reached a basic agreement on the treaty at a June summit meeting in Washington.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'treaties']	<p>The United States and Russia announced agreement today on terms for an ambitious nuclear-arms-reduction treaty, paving the way for a summit meeting as early as this weekend between President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>Rushing to conclude the agreement before the Bush Administration leaves office, and backed by President-elect Bill Clinton, the United States compromised on three technical but important demands by Russia. Mr. Bush is to meet Mr. Yeltsin in Sochi, a Russian resort city on the Black Sea, on his way back to Washington from Somalia, where he is going on Friday.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'banks and banking', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'treaties']	<p>Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States met today in the Belarus capital, Minsk, for a summit meeting that once again failed to give real shape or purpose to the association that emerged 13 months ago as the successor to the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The meeting, which was delayed three times, ended without resolving a quarrel between the commonwealth's two largest members, Russia and Ukraine, over the control of strategic nuclear weapons.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia declared today that despite opposition from the United States, Moscow remained committed to the supply of powerful rocket engines for India's space program.</p> <p>"We do not plan to backtrack," Mr. Yeltsin said at a news conference here, adding that he would discuss the issue with President Clinton. Mr. Yeltsin said he hoped that the United States would respond with "common sense, sensibility" to the announcement.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>On the eve of President Bush's arrival here to sign a nuclear arms reduction treaty, President Boris N. Yeltsin is being criticized for pushing through an accord that some say serves American interests and confirms Russia's subordinate status in a post-Communist world.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, his authority eroded by a bruising battle with the Legislature last month, pressed the White House into a rapid completion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II. Mr. Bush had let it ride during his election campaign, but both sides were eager to complete the treaty. The terms were approved on Tuesday and the signing will be on Saturday.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President-elect Bill Clinton spoke with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today, accepting his invitation for an early summit meeting but cautioning that the date would depend on how quickly he and Congress could get to work on his domestic agenda.</p> <p>The invitation and Mr. Clinton's response underscored the sharply different political timetables on which the two leaders are operating. Mr. Yeltsin has a strong incentive to bond quickly with the new American administration, and Mr. Clinton, an incentive not to seem to be following in Mr. Bush's footsteps by traveling abroad when problems need to be addressed at home.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia said today that he had offered Ukraine security guarantees against nuclear or conventional attack that would come into effect after Kiev's Parliament ratifies the first strategic arms reduction treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p> <p>The offer came in a meeting with the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, who has promised that Ukraine will become a non-nuclear state within seven years, disposing of the 176 strategic nuclear missiles and other nuclear weapons it inherited after the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin spoke by telephone today and agreed to arrange a summit.</p> <p>The White House Press Secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin had agreed that Secretary of State Warren M.

['immigration and refugees']	<p>Raised on tales of Soviet defectors embraced by the United States, Aleksei Bazhenov and four other Russian seamen expected a warm welcome when they jumped ship in Puerto Rico during the July Fourth tall-ships regatta. But not long after they proudly requested political asylum at police stations in San Juan, they began to realize that times have changed.</p> <p>The five young sailors were sent to a maximum-security prison in Maryland, where it gradually occurred to them that asylum seekers from the former Soviet republics might be losing the special status they had during the cold war. And indeed, on Dec. 16, immigration authorities tried to deport them.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia prepare to sign a treaty cutting deep into their nuclear arsenals, Ukraine has been tugging at their sleeves with an awkward and unwelcome question: How much will it cost to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, and who is going to foot the bill?</p> <p>The United States has pledged $800 million to help the states of the former Soviet Union cope with the enormous task of dismantling a vast arsenal of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons. But diplomats here say the cost is likely to be considerably greater.</p> <p>In Moscow this week, a Ukrainian diplomat told reporters that the cost to Ukraine alone will be more than $1.5 billion, a sum he called on the international community to pay. Some experts say that Ukraine's hesitations about renouncing its nuclear status are already casting a pall over the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II, even before it is signed in Moscow this weekend. Lisbon Pacts Await Approval</p> <p>Concerns about costs, but also about Ukrainian security, are the main reasons the Ukrainian Parliament has balked at ratification of arms-reduction agreements reached earlier this year in Lisbon. There, all four of the Soviet Union's successor states with nuclear weapons -- Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- agreed to abide by Start I, which made the first step toward cutting nuclear stockpiles.</p> <p>But only Russia and the United States have actually ratified the treaty. The parliaments of the other three republics have so far held off not only formal approval of Start I, but also ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Until its neighbors agree to these accords, Russia has made it clear it will not begin the slow and costly process of eliminating its own nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>Of the three, Ukraine has protested the loudest, calling the attention of both Russia and the West to what it considers the inequities of the financial burden of disarmament. At a news conference in Moscow this week, Ukraine's Ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Kryshanovsky, said the "very complicated, very difficult economic situation in the Ukraine" was one of the obstacles to the Parliament's ratification of Start I and the non-proliferation treaty.</p> <p>Most observers see the Ukrainian inaction as a bargaining tactic, designed to wrest greater pledges from both the West and Russia for assistance in helping convert to a non-nuclear status. But there is also a parliamentary minority that wants to take another look at Ukraine's commitment to renounce nuclear weapons, as a way both of keeping the West's attention and of protecting itself against Russia.</p> <p>The longer Ukraine withholds final approval of Start I and the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, the longer the shadow it will cast over the agreements to be signed in Moscow this weekend.</p> <p>"If the Ukrainians don't ratify, then it is a show-stopper for both agreements," said one Western diplomat, referring to Start I and Start II.</p> <p>As it is, President Yeltsin is likely to face a tough debate in the Russian Parliament over the ratification of Start II, perceived by some here as favoring the United States.</p> <p>With 176 intercontinental missiles and 16 long-range Backfire bombers based in Ukrainian territory, the republic's participation is crucial to the dismantling of the old Soviet nuclear system. Under the terms of Start I, most of these weapons would be transferred to Russia over the next seven years. The rest would be removed under the non-proliferation pact. Security, Environment, Trade</p> <p>In Kiev this week, Dmytro Pavlychko, head of the Parliament's foreign affairs commission, said he was certain the Parliament would ratify Start I, but not before February. He said the Parliament had three main concerns -- a commitment by nuclear powers to defend Ukraine against aggression, guarantees against environmental damage and the ability to trade directly with buyers of the nuclear material taken from missiles.</p> <p>As it watches Russia sell the plutonium used in nuclear weapons to the United States for cash, Ukraine is seeking compensation for the nuclear material inside the missiles on its territory, either by selling it to Russia, or to the United States directly, or trading it for fuel for nuclear power stations.</p> <p>Given the unknowns surrounding the technology required to dismantle weapons of mass destruction, no hard estimate can be made on how much it will cost either Russia or the United States to neutralize the 18,000 nuclear warheads due to be eliminated under Start I and II. But the sum is expected to be considerable, and the burden is likely to be carried mainly by the United States, diplomats said.</p> <p>"The assumption of the Russians is that this is a continuous process, and clearly there is an American interest involved here in seeing them maintain it," said one Western diplomat. "I think we will be stunned by the costs of taking apart the arsenals built up on both sides."</p> <p>The first installment of the American aid, $165 million, has been earmarked for several specific disarmament projects, including $25 million for a center to monitor the dismantling, $25 million for the disposal of chemical weapons, $50 million for special containers to transport radioactive material and $20 million for special railway cars.</p> <p>The Ukraine has been promised $175 million to help pay for removing and transferring weapons to Russia.</p> <p>Teams of American specialists have already visited Russia several times as advisers on nuclear-dismantling techniques. But several important decisions remain, including whether to build just one center for storage and dismantling, and where the center or centers should be located.</p> <p>With 20 intercontinental missile bases and about 850 multiple-warhead missiles, Russia has by far the largest arsenal of the former Soviet republics. But these bases are widely dispersed within Russia and, unlike American bases, they are not equipped with storage facilities for nuclear warheads. So the removal of the warheads requires that they be transported, often over long distances, and then stored in specially constructed warehouses as they await destruction.</p> <p>--------------------</p> <p>Talks Set for Washington</p> <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Reuters) -- Ukraine is sending a top official to Washington for talks with the Bush Administration and President-elect Clinton's team.</p> <p>Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk will be in the capital Jan. 5-7, a Ukrainian Embassy spokesman, Dimitro Markov, said today.

But he said he had made no decision as to when and where such a meeting would take place.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters at the Hilton Head airport just before returning to Little Rock, Ark., after a six-day family vacation, Mr. Clinton said he was "very pleased" to have received the invitation from Mr. Yeltsin but added: "I have not made a decision about when we're going to meet and where we're going to meet. I think that is going to depend in part on the timetable of the Congress and the work that I have to do here on the problems of America."</p>

['russia-international relations-us']	<p>In principle, summit meetings are not to talk about the weather. But history shows that Russian winters have a way of forcing themselves onto the agenda.</p> <p>First it was a thick wet snow that forced Presidents Bush and Boris N.

Then Mr. Bush flew into a Moscow that was bitterly cold, with temperatures hovering around zero Fahrenheit and the city powdered a fine white.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin accused the United States today of a tendency to "dictate terms" in places like Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, but he added that President Clinton seemed more inclined to seek dialogue.</p> <p>The comments were Mr. Yeltsin's first explicit expression of dissatisfaction over the latest round of American-led bombings of Iraq, or over Washington's stance on the Balkan conflict.</p>

Advertisers who want to appear in the paper's daily four-page spread have to wait for more than a month, while the line to place classifieds spills out of the cramped third-floor offices and into the stairwell.</p> <p>The reason for the flood of advertising is the popularity of Moskovsky Komsomolets, the only major Moscow-based daily to have discovered how to survive in a rough-and-tumble marketplace without government subsidies or outside investors, and with new ideas like advertising, profit and the need to define a paper's relationship to power.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States and allies on the United Nations Security Council told Iraq today that it had 48 hours to remove the newly deployed surface-to-air missiles that threaten their planes patrolling the country's southern skies, or face military retaliation.</p> <p>The ultimatum was presented this afternoon to Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi representative to the United Nations, by the American, British, Russian and French representatives.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Uneasy at the renewed attacks on a former Soviet ally, Russia urged today that the Security Council be reconvened to consider the tensions in Iraq.</p> <p>A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry reiterated Moscow's contention that Iraq was responsible for the conflict and that the solution was for Baghdad to abide by United Nations decisions. But the statement was muted in its support of the United States air strikes.</p>

['reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>At a recent Moscow luncheon hosted by the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, an octogenarian former summiteer summed up his host's political-diplomatic dilemma:</p> <p>"If you seem to walk in lockstep with America," said Richard Nixon, "you give a weapon to your political opponents to beat you over the head. If you don't, the American opponents of aid to Russia will beat you over the head. That's why Foreign Ministers seldom get elected President."</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>In an unusually strong criticism, the International Monetary Fund's top official faulted Russia's Government today for letting inflation get out of control, saying the risk of hyperinflation threatened Russia's fledgling democracy.</p> <p>The official, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said hyperinflation would hurt Russia's poor the most, would jeopardize other economic reforms, and was causing a severe flight of capital that would make economic recovery more difficult.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Reflecting the complexity of Russia's problems, one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most senior analysts today laid out the divisions within the intelligence community and among independent Western and Russian experts on how best to reform Russia and promote its nascent democracy.</p> <p>George Kolt, the National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia, told a Senate panel of three broad areas of disagreement over the degree and pace of reform. His testimony illustrates how difficult it will be for the Clinton Administration to reach a consensus on a strategy for Russia as it begins its formal policy review.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Struggling to earn hard currency and preserve jobs, Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union are selling arms and technology to Iran, China and other countries whose military buildups are causing great concern in the West.</p> <p>The Russian arms exports in particular rankle Washington even though they are down sharply from cold-war days and appear to have little ideological motivation. Critics of the sales also concede that Moscow has extensive control over high-technology arms sales and that it tries to adhere to United Nations arms embargoes.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>Bowing to growing pressure from all but the dwindling minority of democratic reformers, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced today that he was prepared to scrap a constitutional referendum if other means could be found to resolve the paralyzing power struggles with Parliament.</p> <p>The referendum had been scheduled for April 11 to decide the basic principles of a new constitution. It was originally announced last December as the key element in a compromise between Mr. Yeltsin and Speaker of the Parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov, after their struggles at the Congress of People's Deputies last December threatened to become a political war.</p>

Mr. Bartholomew, appointed by President Clinton on Wednesday, had come to Moscow to seek Russia's direct involvement in reaching a broader peace, given Moscow's traditionally close ties to fellow Slavs in Serbia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a move underscoring Russia's hopes of playing a major role alongside America in resolving the Balkans crisis, Moscow told the Security Council on Friday that it was sending a high ranking expert on the former Yugoslavia to serve as its own mediator in the peace talks under way here.</p> <p>The envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly I. Churkin, who has been directing Russian policy on the Balkans in Moscow, will occupy a similar position to that of Reginald Bartholomew, the senior American diplomat named by President Clinton earlier this week as Washington's special envoy at the New York negotiations.</p>

Only he is not fighting against Communists now, but for Russia.</p> <p>In speeches, on Op-Ed pages and today in Russia, the former President has become one of the most dedicated advocates of the notion that the United States must not ignore Russia now that Communism has collapsed.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's Supreme Soviet voted overwhelmingly today for a nonbinding resolution that would overturn Russian policy on the conflict in the Balkans.</p> <p>Several days after President Clinton's special envoy on the Bosnian crisis met with Russian legislators and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, the Supreme Soviet voted 162 to 4 to urge the United Nations to impose sanctions on Croatia or, if not, to lift them on Serbia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>For the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow is moving into the center of the diplomatic arena as a result of President Clinton's conclusion that Russia can exert significant influence, for better or worse, over the fate of the United States plan to end the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p> <p>By making clear today that it wants to involve President Boris N. Yeltsin in the search for a Balkan settlement, the Clinton Administration appears to be seeking both to persuade Moscow to pressure the Serbs to compromise and to insure that Russia does not use its Security Council veto to obstruct the plan.</p>
['foreign aid', 'biographical information']	<p>The State Department today announced the appointment of a career diplomat who is an expert on Russia as the new coordinator for American aid to the former Soviet republics.</p> <p>The announcement came a day after the publication of comments by the current coordinator who had forecast the political demise of President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>The Clinton Administration intends to create a supercommittee in the State Department to shape a unified strategy toward Russia and the other former Soviet republics, but has no intention of immediately increasing foreign aid to the area, senior Administration officials say.</p> <p>In an effort to avoid what it considers President Bush's haphazard approach to the problem, the Administration has chosen Strobe Talbott, a journalist and author who has written extensively about the Soviet Union, to head the committee in his capacity as Ambassador-at-Large to Russia and the other newly independent republics.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The chairmen of the international mediation effort to end the war in the Balkans pressed the United States today to endorse their peace plan, but Secretary of State Warren Christopher declined to do so, setting the stage for a possible confrontation between the mediators and the Clinton Administration.</p> <p>Cyrus R. Vance, the former American Secretary of State who represents the United Nations in the negotiations, and Lord Owen, the European Community representative, moved the Balkan talks to the United Nations today in an attempt to bring the influence of the Security Council more directly to bear on the three factions in the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina to accept their plan. But first the United States, a key Security Council member, had to be persuaded.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin suddenly left Moscow today for what was described as an unexpected 12-day vacation in the countryside. His departure was announced a day before he was scheduled to meet with his outspoken political rival, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the parliamentary Speaker, to discuss whether a constitutional referendum scheduled for April 11 was going to be held.</p> <p>Mr. Khasbulatov, who opposes the referendum he originally agreed to in December, has been caustic about Mr. Yeltsin in recent days, questioning his fitness for office.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>The main contenders in Russia's paralyzing political struggle, President Boris N. Yeltsin and the head of the legislature, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, have agreed to try to work out a power-sharing agreement over the next 10 days, an aide to Mr. Yeltsin said today.</p> <p>The aide, Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, said at a news conference that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Khasbulatov held a 20-minute meeting on Tuesday and agreed to set up a commission to work out a compromise that would allow them to postpone a national referendum on a new constitution. The vote is scheduled for April 11.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market']	<p>President Clinton declared today that having spent trillions of dollars to win the cold war, the United States must summon the will to spend much more than planned in Russia and the other former Soviet republics "to support democracy's success where Communism failed."</p> <p>Documents sent to Capitol Hill with the President's economic message last week, but little noticed at the time, indicated the President will ask for $700 million in aid next year for the former Soviet republics, nearly doubling the $417 million allotted for this year. Mr. Clinton, who plans to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on April 4, said "the world will suffer" if Russia's tottering economic reforms collapse.  [ Excerpts, page 6. ] Wants America to Compete</p> <p>In a speech at American University consciously evocative of one delivered there 30 years ago by John F. Kennedy, the President endorsed the broad thrust of former President George Bush's trade policies. But at the same time, he sent two signals of change with his call for greater support for Russia and a suggestion that he would demand progress on human rights as the price for continued growth in trade with China.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>A new kind of "boat people" are landing on the shores of the Nordic countries, especially Sweden, whose liberal asylum policies have made it a prime destination. They are the product of a traffic in people by which smugglers are making large profits from the refugees' desire to reach safer and more prosperous shores.</p> <p>The new refugees, mainly Iraqis but also families fleeing the fighting in the former Yugoslavia or the devastation of Somalia, take a circuitous route by road, rail, air and sea and pay large amounts of money to be delivered to Sweden or other Nordic countries by "people smugglers," whose trade is centered in Moscow.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin dodged an opening attack by his belligerent legislative opposition today as the Congress of People's Deputies, meeting in emergency session, voted down a proposal that would have stripped him of most of his powers.</p> <p>The proposal won 420 votes, short of the majority needed in the 1,033-member Congress. But it was seen as a sign of Mr. Yeltsin's eroding support and of the open hostility he faces in his battle with the legislature.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration's energetic new campaign to help Boris N. Yeltsin comes at a time when the Russian President's political future is again precarious and he is engaged once again in the trenches with a hostile Congress.</p> <p>And once again, the instinct of the more democratic, prosperous West to protect the tender shoots of freedom in Russia has run up against difficult questions: Can Western aid really help Russia until it sorts out its political and economic mess? What sort of aid does Russia need? Is Mr. Yeltsin really on the ropes? Should the West be concentrating so hard on Mr. Yeltsin -- or on Russia?</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>For a brief moment today, a whiff of the Bastille wafted through the Kremlin.</p> <p>As the Congress of People's Deputies prepared for a secret ballot on toppling President Boris N. Yeltsin and its own chief, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, a spokesman for the Mayor of Moscow warned that the deputies had better have lunch inside the crenelated ramparts of the Kremlin. Outside, he said, the crowds were big.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'television', 'elections']	<p>After narrowly surviving an unexpected vote on his ouster in the Congress of People's Deputies, President Boris N. Yeltsin tonight appeared triumphant before a crowd of jubilant supporters, claiming victory over a "Communist coup d'etat."</p> <p>But after a tense day that began with an aborted compromise and ended with a dramatic showdown, the foes of Mr. Yeltsin were heartened by his close call. Of 1,033 deputies, 617 voted against him in secret balloting, only 72 fewer than the two-thirds required for his removal from office.</p>
['elections']	<p>With the showdown between Russia's executive and legislative branches now in his arena, the head of Russia's highest constitutional tribunal made an 11th-hour appeal Monday to President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Legislature to find a peaceable resolution to their menacing duel.</p> <p>There was no indication, however, that the President was backing down from his declaration on Saturday assuming broad powers and calling for a national vote of confidence on April 25.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Lose Yeltsin, lose the peace dividend. From Richard Nixon on down, commentators treat the prospect of higher defense spending as the clinching argument for increasing Western aid to Russia. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the same case yesterday in his speech before the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Yet the pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later choice they and others pose is less hard-boiled analysis than wishful thinking, and it reflects a failure to imagine the immense problems that will flow from the failure of Russian democracy.</p> <p>Increasing the defense budget bought security during the cold war. It will buy much less if things now go wrong in Russia. The real cost we face is not the loss of the peace dividend, but the loss of American pre-eminence.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'foreign aid', 'war and revolution']	<p>International efforts to end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina appeared in disarray today after Russia delayed a NATO plan to shoot down warplanes flying there and the mediators warned that they might wrap up their peace talks this week unless they make more progress.</p> <p>After agreeing in principle on Friday to adopt a resolution enforcing its ban on flights over Bosnia today, the Security Council was forced to postpone the vote after Russia indicated that it was not ready. Under the proposed resolution, NATO would be given the task of patrolling Bosnian airspace and shooting down any aircraft violating the ban.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin has rolled the dice one more time in the name of democracy, and he and his Vice President and former ally, Aleksandr V.

['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'law and legislation']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher today endorsed President Boris N. Yeltsin's call for a national referendum, and coupled it with an appeal to the American people to support increased financial aid to Russia.</p> <p>In the Administration's fullest statement on Russia since Mr. Yeltsin claimed emergency powers on Saturday, Mr. Christopher described the Russian political crisis as the "greatest strategic challenge of our time." He gave strong backing to the embattled Russian leader, signaling that the United States would support him as long as he acted peacefully and guaranteed civil liberties.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>The Constitutional Court, established in July 1991, is the first independent judiciary in Russian history. Previously, all courts had been part of executive structures.</p> <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin developed the idea of a Constitutional Court in early 1991, when he was head of the Russian Parliament under the Soviet Union. In a draft of a new constitution for the Russian Republic, Mr. Yeltsin envisioned a court that would be a true third branch of government to maintain a democratic constitutional system in which rule of law would replace arbitrary decision making.</p>

It took him 45 years, but Father Sergei came back.</p> <p>Two years ago, he quit his large, rich parish in Moscow, made his way by train, bus and foot to his grandfather's church deep in the forests and bogs of the upper Volga valley, picked up a broom and started sweeping out the decades of debris and neglect.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Adjourning after a tumultuous four-day session, the Congress of People's Deputies agreed today to a referendum next month on Russia's rule, setting the stage for another round in its overheated confrontation with President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>One day after it narrowly failed to oust the President, the Congress accepted his call for a national vote of confidence in his leadership on April 25, but wrapped it in additional questions and conditions that threatened to make the results indecisive.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The Clinton Administration is likely to ask Congress to increase direct American aid for Russia next year from the $700 million previously proposed to more than $1 billion, and to direct the assistance to Russian farmers, entrepreneurs and military officers, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>Several key lawmakers involved in foreign aid said they would be inclined to go along with the increased spending for Russia if the President is willing to make the case to the American people.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'foreign aid', 'war and revolution']	<p>The airdrops of relief supplies into Bosnia and Herzegovina by the United States and the offer of similar help by Russia have been welcomed by many Serbs, who see such cooperation within the United Nations as the only hope of ending the Balkan war.</p> <p>It is not clear how much influence these people have on the president of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, whose nationalistic policy the United Nations has blamed for much of the violence.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'public opinion', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Those who would disagree, as I do, with some of the specific proposals in President Clinton's economic program must give him credit for his boldness and political courage in advocating them and for his indefatigable efforts to sell them to the American people.</p> <p>If he demonstrates the same leadership qualities in addressing the major foreign policy issue of our time, he can secure his place in history as a great President. That issue is the survival and success of political and economic freedom in Russia.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and his parliamentary opponents were deadlocked today after the Constitutional Court said that Mr. Yeltsin's assumption of "special powers" had violated the Constitution. The expected judgment, by a young court with untested powers, did little to still Russia's political war of nerves.</p> <p>There seemed no early end to the continuing power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Parliament. The President has called for a plebiscite on April 25 to decide whether the country should be ruled primarily by the executive branch or by the legislature, while the conservatives and Communists who dominate the Parliament have talked of impeaching Mr. Yeltsin since his speech on Saturday.</p>
['medicine and health', 'elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'reform and reorganization', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Following is a transcript of the question-and-answer portion of President Clinton's first official news conference, held in the East Room of the White House today, as recorded by The New York Times:</p> <p>Q.  Mr. President, would you be willing to hold the summit meeting in Moscow if it would be best for President Yeltsin's political health? Have you spoken to President Yeltsin? And don't you think that if you did go through Moscow it would engage the U.S. too closely in the power struggle in the capital?</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'credit', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The need to clarify U.S. policy toward Russia has been heightened by the political crisis in Moscow. Our long-term interests there can be promoted by practical aid and people-to-people programs.</p> <p>Boris Yeltsin's solution to the impasse between a popularly elected President and a Parliament that, under the Constitution, is the supreme organ of the state shows he believes the answer to the problems of emerging democracy is more democracy. He has cast his fate on the seas of his own waning but still significant popularity.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton today brushed aside criticism that he was too closely tied to President Boris N. Yeltsin, saying that Mr. Yeltsin's decision to circumvent the Russian Parliament was "appropriate" and that he would give Mr. Yeltsin "an aggressive and quite specific plan" of aid at their summit meeting.</p> <p>"Boris Yeltsin is the elected President of Russia, and he has shown a great deal of courage in sticking up for democracy and civil liberties and market reforms, and I'm going to support that," Mr. Clinton said, adding that he would begin briefing Congress this week on his aid proposals.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States is preparing to pare down the military power created by almost a half-century of American strategy and investment and a national lifetime of industrial growth.</p> <p>Aside from those whose jobs are threatened, most Americans are paying about as much close attention as to the peeling of a banana.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>The People's Congress voted overwhelmingly today to sharply curb President Boris N. Yeltsin's powers and to cancel a planned referendum next month that he had hoped would give him a popular mandate to accelerate economic change.</p> <p>A final vote is expected Friday. But already this evening it was evident that the thousand deputies, elected three years ago under the Communist system, intended to reject any proposals put forth by Mr. Yeltsin and to assume more authority for themselves and for their chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>As it watches the unfolding political turmoil in Moscow, the Clinton Administration is caught between its desire to support President Boris N. Yeltsin and its concern that he might take authoritarian measures to stay in power.</p> <p>In strong statements of support in recent days, President Clinton has portrayed Mr. Yeltsin as the best hope for economic and political reform in Russia and has promised to "do what we can" to help him succeed.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Russian Parliament voted today to summon an emergency session of the full Congress of People's Deputies next week, setting the legislative branch on course for a showdown with President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>The Congress is the highest legal authority in Russia, and a session had been sought by both the standing Parliament and by Mr. Yeltsin to resolve whether there should be a national referendum in April, or under what conditions it should be called off.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In an effort to bolster President Boris N. Yeltsin's political position, the White House is considering offering him loan guarantees to house demobilized Russian troops and an enterprise fund to support emerging Russian capitalists, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>These ideas are being considered as part of what President Clinton said would be "some innovative solutions" for aiding Russia that he will propose to President Yeltsin when the two meet next month, officials said. Mr. Clinton announced today that the meeting would be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>The Clinton Administration, working to assemble a new aid package to help President Boris N. Yeltsin, has proposed that the International Monetary Fund greatly increase its assistance to Russia.</p> <p>The Administration has also suggested that the I.M.F. ease some restrictions that blocked the delivery of much of the Western aid promised last year.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>With the campaign to oust President Boris N. Yeltsin collapsing, a specially summoned Congress of People's Deputies moved today toward a compromise that would include new elections both for President and the legislature.</p> <p>After two weeks of brutal maneuvering and clashes, nerves and tempers were taut, and the Kremlin rang with some of the bitterest invective yet in the drawn-out power struggle.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The failure of the Congress of People's Deputies to find a workable compromise for governing Russia raises questions not only about President Boris N. Yeltsin's political future and economic reforms but also about the very survival of the Russian Federation.</p> <p>The threat to the unity of the Russian Federation is probably most significant. Already over the last 15 months, Russia's various semi-autonomous regions, provinces and cities have seized considerable autonomy.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia asked President Clinton today to help stabilize his country's teetering economy by purchasing its oil, lifting trade restrictions, rescheduling the repayment of its debt and lobbying for the country's admission to the club of industrialized nations.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton in turn pledged to continue his efforts on behalf of Russia by telephoning foreign leaders, asking Americans for support for an extensive economic aid package and avoiding potentially inflammatory comment on Russia's political turmoil.</p>
['public opinion']	<p>From the Finnish border to the Arctic expanses of eastern Siberia, local reaction to the power struggle in Moscow has been varied and contradictory, offering a realistic picture of the strains within the giant and increasingly wobbly Russian Federation.</p> <p>In some regions, the conflict in the capital has been mirrored on the local level, with regional councils, known here as "soviets," taking the side of the Russian Parliament, and the heads of local administrations following the lead of President Boris N. Yeltsin, who in most cases had a direct hand in their appointments.</p>
['public opinion']	<p>Snow fell again today, a fast end to a false spring, and as the Russian power struggle ground on without quick compromise, in the cafes and streets of Moscow there was confusion, exhaustion and, suddenly, some real fear about what is at stake.</p> <p>With a tradition of autocratic rule, many Russians tend to regard politics as above and beyond them, a different circle of existence, best avoided. In the beginning of this latest collision between President Boris N. Yeltsin and the legislature, the reaction of many ordinary people was to regard it as one more clash of egos among politicians.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin softened his emergency measures today, but efforts at compromise with the legislature faltered and the full Congress of People's Deputies was summoned for Friday to take up the question of removing him from office.</p> <p>Hopes for a political settlement rose in the early afternoon when the four top officials of the Russian federation -- Mr. Yeltsin; the chairman of the Congress, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov; the chairman of the Constitutional Court, Valery D. Zorkin, and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin -- agreed to meet.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>In his first public appearance since his drubbing at the hands of the Russian legislature, President Boris N. Yeltsin told the visiting French President today that Moscow needed urgent help from the West to block what he described as a threatened Communist comeback.</p> <p>Describing the results of the Congress of People's Deputies as a "cause for serious worries," Mr. Yeltsin said he was still considering what steps to take next.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As political odd couples go, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon surely rank with the oddest. But there they were today, the Vietnam dove and the Vietnam hawk,sitting around the White House living room, bonded together by their shared feelings about Russia.</p> <p>Never mind that Mr. Nixon rose to the Presidency riding the issue of opposition to Communist Russia, while Mr. Clinton's only noteworthy experience with the place was a youthful tourist visit, for which he was attacked during the Presidential campaign. Today, the two men find themselves sharing a political trench in the renewed debate over how much aid to give Russia, at a time when its first democratically elected President is at risk of being toppled.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid']	<p>The Clinton Administration said today that Russia had agreed to send military transport planes to join the airdrop of relief supplies to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that nine other countries had offered to donate food and medicine.</p> <p>Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, speaking in Moscow after meeting with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, said the Russian operation could begin "pretty quickly" after technical questions like guaranteeing the security of Russian aircraft had been resolved. Russia has been an ally of Serbia in the past.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he was prepared to take unspecified "extreme measures" if the Russian Congress rejects his proposals for an agreed separation of powers.</p> <p>Speaking to members of the Democratic Choice faction, which broadly supports his reform programs, Mr. Yeltsin renewed a warning to the Congress of People's Deputies, which has become a powerful force against him.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The political unrest in Russia has stalled efforts to substantially reduce nuclear arsenals in the United States and the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>In Ukraine, new fears of Russian nationalism have encouraged an increasingly vocal group of legislators who advocate keeping some nuclear weapons. President Leonid Kravchuk had promised last year that Ukraine would ratify not only the 1991 Soviet-American agreement reducing nuclear warheads, but also the non-proliferation treaty of 1970, which would oblige it to give up all nuclear weapons.  Treaties Need One Another</p> <p>The breakup of the Soviet Union left nuclear weapons in four republics: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. All but Ukraine have ratified the July 1991 treaty, which called for one-third cuts in the nuclear warheads on Soviet and American ballistic missiles, and Ukrainian legislators, who are debating the treaty, are hesitant about giving up the weapons they inherited from the Soviet Union.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>A program to use $800 million in American funds to help dismantle Russia's nuclear weapons has bogged down over chaos within Russia, Moscow's lingering obsession with secrecy and its determination to make as much money as it can on the nuclear materials that the country is giving up, a Senate committee was told today.</p> <p>Sixteen months ago, Congress authorized the first half of the $800 million, but only $25 million has been spent. A total of $303 million has been committed to particular projects, but much of that is contingent on decisions by Russia or the other three former Soviet states that have nuclear weapons -- Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>Deputies converged on Moscow today from the far reaches of Russia for the latest showdown with President Boris N. Yeltsin. Despite three months of brutal maneuvering by both sides, nobody could predict how this session of the Congress of Peoples' Deputies might play out, or even how long it might last.</p> <p>The Congress, whose 1,000-plus members are the highest legal authority in Russia, was officially summoned to an emergency session beginning on Wednesday to decide a relatively simple question -- should Russia go ahead with a national referendum on the Constitution that the deputies and Mr. Yeltsin agreed to last December.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'treaties', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Clinton said today that he would support an emergency meeting of the major industrialized democracies to discuss how they can bolster the Russian democracy movement, adding that the group's next planned summit in July might be too long to wait.</p> <p>"The important point I'd like to make," Mr. Clinton said, after talks with President Francois Mitterrand of France, "is I don't believe we can wait until July for the major countries of the world, who care about what happens in Russia and who would like very much to keep political and economic reform on track there, to move."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Germany, France and other European countries sided cautiously today with President Boris N. Yeltsin as the elected leader of Russia in his showdown with the Russian Parliament, a holdover from the Communist era.</p> <p>In statements that reflected a consensus that Mr. Yeltsin was the best hope for continued democratic and economic change, European leaders expressed hope that the confrontation would be short-lived and peaceful.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>As events unfold in Moscow with dizzying speed and unpredictability, the Administration is struggling to temper its strong support for President Boris N. Yeltsin with a dose of Realpolitik.</p> <p>Ultimately, the Administration knows that what is most important in Russia -- the continuation of democratic and economic reform -- transcends the personal fortunes of one man.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots', 'biographical information']	<p>A shaken Russian Parliament resolved today to take President Boris N. Yeltsin to the Constitutional Court, but the angry legislators stopped short of directly moving against the President or trying to block the emergency powers he claimed against them on Saturday.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin did not attend the session. The evening television news program said that his mother had died at 84 and that he had gone home to Yekaterinburg.</p>
['public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>As demonstrators gathered by the Russian Parliament building today on the banks of the Moscow River, President Boris N. Yeltsin got his first set of early returns from the Russian people, who will be asked in a month to break the country's political stalemate.</p> <p>By midafternoon, two opposing crowds had formed, facing off across barricades reinforced by rows of parked jeeps and buses. One was rallying under a forest of red Soviet flags, symbol of the Communist-nationalist opposition to Mr. Yeltsin's Government; the other, across the street, was waving the white, red and blue of the Russian tricolor, which has become Mr. Yeltsin's emblem.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Revving up their all-out verbal attack against President Boris N. Yeltsin and his battered economic program, his major opponents in the Russian Congress have dropped all pretenses and revealed their unreconstructed Communist instincts.</p> <p>As the members of the Congress of People's Deputies gather for the ninth time since their election in 1990, the word "democrat" is spoken with a contemptuous sneer, while "comrade," once used solely by the staunchest of Communists, has become fashionable again.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>Faced with a severe new assault from an aroused Congress of People's Deputies, President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly changed course today and urged that he and the leaders of the legislature, the Government and the Constitutional Court meet until they reach accord.</p> <p>The unexpected, emotional and apparently improvised appeal from Mr. Yeltsin came at the end of a day in which the tide of battle between the President and hostile deputies rocked back and forth to the constant din of heated insults.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Despite the battering of President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Government by conservatives in the Congress of People's Deputies, no one expects a return to the centralized command economy of socialism, which is widely understood to be as failed an economic idea as Communism is a political one.</p> <p>The consensus among diplomats, economists and other analysts is that some sort of market economy will emerge, in large part because no alternative seems readily available.</p>
['religion and churches', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The President of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government agreed today to a plan to end the year-old war that has torn apart his country, and international mediators said later that the world must prepare to take tougher action against the Serbs, whose leadership in Bosnia still refuses to make peace.</p> <p>After a day of last-minute bargaining and delays, President Alija Izetbegovic approved a map dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into 10 near-autonomous provinces and an amended plan for governing the country while a new constitution is drawn up.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>As the Bosnian war approaches its first anniversary next week, Serbian forces have embarked on a major offensive apparently intended to bury current peace plans beneath the upheaval and devastation on the ground.</p> <p>Given their growing diplomatic isolation, the Serbs seem to have concluded that the only thing on their side is military might. And that isolation increased today when the head of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government signed an international mediation team's peace plan in New York.  [ Page A12. ]</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'law and legislation', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The leader of Russia's Legislature indicated on the eve of a session of the Congress of People's Deputies that he would try to head off a vote on ousting President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>His statement reinforced speculation that the deputies lacked the two-thirds majority needed to vote the President out of office. But as the deputies converged on Moscow from around Russia and both sides issued their final appeals, it was evident that this would be the most contentious and fateful session of the Congress in the three years since it was elected.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>President Clinton has fashioned a no-lose policy to go the extra mile in aid and showmanship to "save" President Yeltsin and democracy in Russia. If it succeeds, he becomes Saint Bill. If it fails, somebody else has to take the blame -- Congress or the allies for not coughing up enough aid, or George Bush for doing practically nothing or the big bad Russians themselves.</p> <p>No President could resist such a policy. Politically, it's foolproof. No one will ever be able to tar him with losing Russia. Strategically, it's probably his best shot. He knows that Western efforts can help only at the margins. But sometimes great historical scales are tipped by a single act of courage or one vote or a seemingly futile outstretched hand.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin was not the only one to leave the Congress of People's Deputies in disgust this week. Today, Viktor P. Mironov, a 43-year-old deputy who took office three years ago on the first wave of Russian democracy, went up to a microphone and announced that he was handing in his mandate as a deputy to protest the "return of the Communist dictatorship."</p> <p>"Enough is enough," he said later outside the coatroom of the Grand Kremlin Palace, explaining his solitary walkout. "I don't want to be an extra in this spectacle, with 700 Communists running the show. For all intents and purposes, this Congress was a coup d'etat."</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton today rejected criticism that his policy toward Russia was too dependent on the survival of Boris N. Yeltsin, but he declined to say how he would react if the Russian President moved to suspend Parliament or resorted to military force.</p> <p>In his most detailed comments on the beleaguered Russian leader, Mr. Clinton also asserted that the Group of Seven major industrialized nations should play a more aggressive role in helping Mr. Yeltsin. He said countries with a stake in the future of Russia had given him "an inadequate response to date."</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>A Russian Deputy Prime Minister arrived here today to ask officials of leading industrial nations for economic help for his country and political support for President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>The Russian official, Boris G. Fyodorov, was invited to confer with top officials from the Group of Seven who are planning the summit meeting of those nations' leaders to be held in Tokyo in July. The officials from the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan are expected to issue a statement showing support for Russia's transition to democracy and a market economy.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Barely pausing for a backhanded rejection of President Boris N. Yeltsin's final bid for a national referendum on who should govern Russia, the Congress of People's Deputies today concluded a four-day rout of the President and dispersed for another three months.</p> <p>Abandoning even the pretense of national unity that they made at previous sessions, the 1,000 or so deputies left with a statement to the nation that harshly criticized the President and his reforms and left little doubt that the confrontation would only get worse.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Russia's Foreign Minister said today that he was looking to the United States to put some substance into its protestations of support for Moscow at President Clinton's meeting next month with President Boris N. Yeltsin, not only through material aid but by making room for Russia in the international market for high technology and arms.</p> <p>Interviewed in the Stalinesque ministry building where he seemed to be working almost alone on a holiday weekend, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said the United States could not sit back waiting for Russia to sort out its domestic problems but must rather "actively support the reformers" -- above all Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In an effort to support President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and his democratic reform movement, President Clinton is to meet with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia in Washington next week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today.</p> <p>The meeting comes as the Administration is struggling, in the absence of major new financing, to put together a package of small-scale incentives to promote Russia's economic and political reform movement before the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>After a final rebuff by a hostile Congress of People's Deputies, President Boris N. Yeltsin stalked out of the Grand Kremlin Palace today and said he would call a nationwide referendum on his own to decide who should rule Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin threw down his challenge after the 1,041-member Congress -- the country's highest legislative body, which has become the bulwark of opposition to change -- adopted a resolution undercutting the President's authority and making him vulnerable to threats of impeachment. "I came to the Congress hoping that the spirit of concord would prevail here in spite of everything," the President said in a brief, unemotional speech. "Despite everything, the Congress has turned toward still greater confrontation."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'russia-international relations-us', 'law and legislation']	<p>In a strong signal of support for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, a senior Administration official said today that Washington would not oppose a move by Mr. Yeltsin to suspend his Parliament or abolish the Soviet-era Constitution to put down his political opposition.</p> <p>But the official said the United States would react strongly if Mr. Yeltsin resorted to military force to keep power in the face of action by the Congress of People's Deputies that could strip him of much of his authority. Confidence About Yeltsin</p> <p>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Clinton Administration did not believe that Mr. Yeltsin would do any of these things, despite his threats to abolish the congress and impose military rule.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton gave strong support to President Boris N. Yeltsin today after the Russian leader's declaration of special rule and said he would meet Mr. Yeltsin as scheduled in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4.</p> <p>But Mr. Clinton stopped short of backing any further actions Mr. Yeltsin might take to cling to power. The President spoke approvingly of the democratic process in Russia and Mr. Yeltsin's role in it, rather than of Mr. Yeltsin as an individual.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Fighting back against an opposition that showed him little mercy last week, President Boris N. Yeltsin reached tonight for his last, and perhaps only, weapon: a direct appeal to an exhausted people to place their trust in him once again.</p> <p>In effect, Russia's President is seeking to overturn the country's feeble and flawed constitutional system by popular mandate, rather than with tanks. But for all its boldness, the President's gamble only revealed the weakness of his position, setting the stage for a conflict that promises to extend far beyond the walls of the Kremlin.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Declaring it his duty "as a citizen, as a patriot and as a decent man," President Boris N. Yeltsin today assumed virtually unlimited powers and ordered national balloting to decide how and by whom Russia is to be governed.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's dramatic appeal to the nation in a televised address plunged the country into an immediate crisis.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>The elderly woman, confined to her room on the fourth floor of a rundown building in Moscow's proletarian district, knew how she wanted to vote in Russia's referendum today. "For Yeltsin," she said, firmly addressing the two young election workers who had brought her a sealed ballot box upon her request.</p> <p>As they explained patiently, that meant that she would have to cross out the "nyet,"or "no," on the ballot. However puzzling it might seem, the only way to register support for President Boris N. Yeltsin was to negate a negative -- just one of many confusing moments in this befuddled, though potentially crucial, vote.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Voters across Russia gave what looked to be a firm vote of confidence to President Boris N. Yeltsin today in the long-awaited referendum on the country's future. But even before the results were in, opposing sides in the country's power struggle girded for battle over them.</p> <p>Preliminary indications were that Russians had turned out in large numbers and had rallied strongly behind Mr. Yeltsin, while demanding even more strongly new elections to the Congress of People's Deputies, which has obstructed Mr. Yeltsin's economic programs and nearly ousted him in March.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton told Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa Tuesday night that American contributions to Russia would increase by at least $2 billion, officials here said today.</p> <p>The figure would more than double the original $1.6 billion the President had pledged to Russia.</p>
['foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United Nations issued an emergency appeal for more food for Bosnia and Herzegovina today as five Security Council members raised the flag of revolt against the attempt by the United States and Russia to delay new sanctions against Serbia.</p> <p>In Geneva, Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote to aid-giving governments expressing "deep alarm" at the shortage of food for the 2.8 million people now dependent on United Nations rations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>One week before Japan is to be host for a high-level international conference on providing aid to Russia, Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa decided today to name a relative newcomer to international affairs to replace his ailing Foreign Minister, setting off an intense power struggle in the governing Liberal Democratic Party.</p> <p>Some commentators said the decision to name Kabun Muto, who formerly held the posts of Minister of Agriculture and of International Trade and Industry, to replace Michio Watanabe, a plain-spoken political veteran, could make it more difficult for Japan to break from its policy of reluctantly providing aid to Russia and establish a new course as a leader in the industrial world's efforts to encourage change in the former Soviet Union.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Vietnam provided American investigators with documents today that it says prove the fraudulence of a report found in Russia which suggests that hundreds of American prisoners of war were never freed.</p> <p>John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general who is President Clinton's envoy to Vietnam, said it was too early to assess the Vietnamese documents. But at a meeting with Hanoi officials, he warned that the report, a Russian translation of a 1972 Vietnamese document, appeared to be authentic and had "created very serious questions" about the fate of missing Americans.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>A week before a crucial referendum on Boris N. Yeltsin's presidency, the Yeltsin Foundation, organized to marshal support for him here in his hometown, has total assets in hand of 80,000 rubles, or about $101.</p> <p>Alya I. Tanachyova, a former Yeltsin aide and family friend who runs the foundation, rather apologetically displays a small pile of placards and leaflets urging support for Mr. Yeltsin in the nationwide vote on April 25. Mr. Yeltsin has portrayed the vote as pitting the democratic future against the totalitarian past and says it will decide who will govern Russia: he or the conservative legislature, a holdover from the Communist era.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>At Moscow's urging and with the support of the Clinton Administration, the Security Council today postponed voting new economic sanctions against the Yugoslav Serbs until after a referendum in Russia on April 25.</p> <p>The postponement is an effort to help President Boris N. Yeltsin win his struggle with the Russian Parliament.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Despite its strong statements supporting new sanctions against the Serbs, the Clinton Administration bowed today to a Russian request that such a move be delayed to give Moscow more time to pressure the Serbs directly, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said.</p> <p>The United Nations Security Council delayed voting on sanctions until after Russia holds a referendum on April 25 on constitutional revisions.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Russia wrapped up its preparations today for Sunday's referendum, showing that it had fully learned at least those lessons of democracy that deal with brash campaigning, pork barrels, pressed flesh and dirty tricks.</p> <p>Despite initial warnings that Russians were tired of politicking and would not bother to vote, the latest opinion polls predict a turnout as high as 75 percent in virtually all parts of the country.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Like most events in Russia these days, the announcement by the Group of Seven on Thursday of a new Western aid package was quickly turned into a weapon by each of the opposing sides in Moscow's political wars.</p> <p>Pravda, the old Communist Party daily that now reflects the opinion of the conservative-nationalist opposition, reacted to the package approved in Tokyo by the leading industrial nations with a rhetorical question: "What then does Russia get out of this?" The answer: "A further increase in its dependence on the West in different spheres."</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Russia is at a painful turning point, facing momentous alternatives but appearing powerless to make a deliberate choice. Its people stand at the junction of their authoritarian traditions and their novel experiment with political freedom; they hover between a state economy and a free market; they are simultaneously bound together and driven apart by their history and their current striving for a new identity.</p> <p>Hardly any nation's future is more crucial to global well-being than Russia's and hardly any nation's future is more uncertain. After decades of gray, predictable Soviet inertia, the land that sprawls some 6,000 miles from Europe to the Pacific rim churns with volatility. Even tomorrow is a question.</p> <p>As President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton were preparing for their summit meeting, scheduled for this weekend, the rising confrontation between Yeltsin and his legislature reached a crescendo. In the absence of a firm constitutional structure, any outcome seemed possible.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After Presidents Clinton and Boris Yeltsin leave Vancouver, it would be a good time to ratchet down the ceremony between American and Russian leaders.</p> <p>One cannot help but be struck that in atmospherics the Vancouver summit resembles less the low-key sessions Mr. Clinton recently has had with Western leaders than the media events of the cold war: two leaders flying to a third country at a moment of world drama, the throwaway remarks as they vanish behind closed doors, the TV correspondents filling time outside, the instant assessments.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>It could have been a really bad hair day.</p> <p>With the summit meeting beginning on a dreary, rainy note, everyone here was on tenterhooks to see how two of the world's most celebrated silvery and unruly manes would fare.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>No Russian or Soviet President has ever traveled abroad watching his back quite as anxiously as President Boris N. Yeltsin must in Vancouver.</p> <p>In his very first comments on arrival here for his summit meeting with President Clinton, Mr. Yeltsin gave a measure of the danger he faced when he acknowledged that even overly generous Western aid could be a weapon against him in the vicious political struggle back home.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Not so long ago, Boris Yeltsin was Communist Party boss in Sverdlovsk and Bill Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. Now both country pols have made good: the back-slapping Russian bear and the bear-hugging American. And now they are binding their fortunes and futures in Vancouver, the Russian plotting to survive and the American to succeed in a place appropriately much closer to Washington than to Moscow -- and at a meeting it is no longer fitting to call a summit.</p> <p>Both men overcame long odds with perseverance and daring to get to Vancouver. Each in his own way, each according to his circumstance.</p>
['foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>As President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia began their first summit meeting today, Mr. Clinton presented the Russian leader with some $1 billion in American aid programs intended to support Russian democrats and spur the Western allies to make Russian reform their top foreign policy priority.</p> <p>Among the new or expanded programs in the package were loan guarantees to build apartments for demobilized Russian soldiers; loans for Russian entrepreneurs; medical supplies, food and grain assistance; funds to help the Russian Government sell state-owned industries, and technical advisers to help repair pipelines and oil wells and begin exporting again.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>Despite a new round of appeals and incentives from abroad to push for economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin is raising wages, increasing spending and issuing low-cost credits for bankrupt industries as part of a campaign to win a crucial referendum this month.</p> <p>The steps being carried out by Mr. Yeltsin include linking interest on savings to inflation, raising benefits for the military and maintaining price controls -- all of which economists say swell the Government deficit and aggravate inflation.</p>
['foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Underscoring the international community's problems in pushing through even modest measures to punish the Serbs for resisting a peace accord for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia refused today to accept a toughened set of American-sponsored sanctions against Belgrade.</p> <p>In a threat to Washington's hopes for a positive vote on the new sanctions at the United Nations on Monday, Russia told the Security Council that it cannot agree to their main points: seizing Yugoslav transport equipment, banning all ships entering Yugoslav waters and more strictly enforcing an existing trade embargo.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>Under heavy pressure from the Clinton Administration and other Western governments, the International Monetary Fund is moving to ease restrictions on aid to Russia with the aim of freeing several billion dollars in assistance.</p> <p>The much-needed burst of new assistance to the suffering Russian economy would follow a year when the monetary fund gave Moscow far less money than anticipated because Russia failed to take the strict austerity measures the fund demanded.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>As a vast European tragedy unfolds a tragedy unprecedented in 50 years -- where is the Western political leadership that will halt this slaughter of the innocents?</p> <p>Sanctions have not persuaded the Serbians to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan and honor a cease-fire. The case for Western intervention in Bosnia has become overwhelming. Margaret Thatcher may have been emotional in calling for military intervention against Serbians. But she struck a chord with millions.</p>
['elections']	<p>A ruling today by the Constitutional Court made it statistically more likely that President Boris N. Yeltsin would win a vote of confidence in Sunday's referendum.</p> <p>But even such a victory is not expected to resolve the political impasse that has brought Russia to a near-standstill.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>With nearly complete tallies confirming President Boris N. Yeltsin's impressive vote of confidence in the referendum on Sunday, speculation turned today to his options in trying to turn this moral victory into political advantage.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, who had much to lose, is in a significantly stronger position than he was a week ago, but his quandary remains the same. He wants to crack the iron mold of a Soviet-era Constitution and holdover legislature, the Congress of People's Deputies, but he can do so only with extra-constitutional means.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'public opinion', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Behind Western Europe's reluctance to agree to air strikes or ground operations to halt Serbian attacks against Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fear, expressed today by the European Community's peace negotiator, Lord Owen, of becoming involved in somebody else's civil war.</p> <p>"Europe must not become combatants in a civil war," Lord Owen said in an interview. "It will be very difficult for the Europeans to take American suggestions of military action seriously until your forces are also on the ground as peacekeepers."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia pressed tonight for further postponement of a Security Council vote planned for Monday on tightening the economic embargo against Yugoslavia, diplomats said.</p> <p>Consultations continued between Council members over sanctions that are intended to press what remains of Yugoslavia to use its influence to help end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been fighting Muslims and Croats for more than a year. One diplomat involved in the issue thought postponement of the vote was likely, but others said a final decision on whether to proceed with the new sanctions probably would be made on Monday.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In an effort to minimize the chances of a clash with Serbian forces, NATO planes policing the no-flight zone over Bosnia have been instructed to refrain from firing on Serbian aircraft that violate the ban, except as a last resort.</p> <p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to begin enforcing the zone on Monday. But NATO's rules of engagement stand in sharp contrast to the aggressive enforcement of the air-exclusion zones over northern and southern Iraq by the United States and its British and French allies.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>After a day of tense negotiations, the United Nations Security Council brushed aside a new cease-fire agreement in the battered Bosnian Muslim town of Srebrenica and voted late tonight to impose Draconian new sanctions on the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro.</p> <p>Russia had fought hard to delay the vote until after the April 25 referendum on President Boris N. Yeltsin and his economic reforms because his nationalist opponents sympathize with the Serbs. But after hours of brinkmanship, Russia finally accepted defeat and abstained instead of using its Security Council veto to block the new sanctions. China also abstained.  'Total Isolation'</p> <p>But all 13 other Security Council members voted in favor of the punishing new sanctions, which France's representative, Jean Bernard Merimee, described as "the total economic and financial isolation of Serbia."</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid', 'finances']	<p>With the cold war won and gone, you thought you had heard the last of pols and policy experts using the Moscow menace to justify excessive military spending. Think again.</p> <p>Many in Washington are now arguing that if Russian hard-liners topple President Yeltsin, they'll unearth their old military Frankenstein, quickly charge him up and dispatch him once again to terrorize the world.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>We are coming up to April 22, which I like to celebrate with a smear of caviar on a small potato, washed down by a shot of very cold vodka -- as the day Aleksandr Kerensky was born 112 years ago.</p> <p>For four tempestuous months in 1917, between the overthrow of the Romanov Czar and the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, Kerensky -- a fiery orator of mildly Socialist views -- headed the first republican experiment in Russia. If he had been tougher on the Bolsheviks and had some outside help, the 20th century might have been far less bloody.</p>

['russia-international relations-us', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Russian officials today began the process of selling the results of the Vancouver summit meeting at a Kamchatka fuel stop, even before landing in Moscow. But the view here was that President Boris N. Yeltsin had done himself some good with a dignified, "presidential" summit organized to insure that he had to give few public concessions to President Clinton.</p> <p>Still, Russian analysts and ordinary citizens interviewed today agreed that the meeting was unlikely to be a decisive factor on April 25, when Russians vote -- or decide not to vote -- in an plebiscite on Mr. Yeltsin's performance as President and the possibility of early presidential and congressional elections.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>If you have any ideas about new options in Serbia and Bosnia, the President said on the phone after the summit talks, let me know. So I did.</p> <p>The answer popped out: Mr. President, please get your Administration and the Western allies to pay a lot more attention to Serbian democrats.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's victory in the referendum on Sunday produced expressions of relief today from the White House, the State Department and Congressional supporters of the proposed $1.8 billion aid package for Russia, which would have been killed by a vote of no confidence.</p> <p>"This is a very, very good day, not only for the people of Russia, but for the people of the United States and all the people of the world," President Clinton said today during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House where he greeted members the University of Arkansas track team.</p>
['public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents moved quickly today to discredit the results of Sunday's referendum. According to incomplete returns, a solid majority of Russian voters backed both Mr. Yeltsin and his program of economic change.</p> <p>An unexpectedly large turnout, estimated at 65.7 percent, helped Mr. Yeltsin score a popular victory over the Congress of People's Deputies, the bulwark of his conservative opposition, which was brusquely rebuffed by voters. But even with 93.5 percent of the vote counted, it was clear that the referendum had failed to resolve Russia's political wars, and instead only opened a new front.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin hadn't spent more than two hours in Siberia's coal country, considered one of his most loyal strongholds, before he was accosted by his first angry pensioner of the day.</p> <p>As the elderly woman, her head wrapped in a tight red kerchief, continued her tirade about the miseries of life on a monthly pension of 6,000 rubles, the President became exasperated.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>The world's seven leading industrial nations pledged support today to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia but were still struggling to assemble an aid program to promote his economic reforms and to help him win a nationwide referendum in less than two weeks.</p> <p>Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan opened the two-day conference saying that Russia was at a "critical juncture, with the reform efforts under the leadership of President Yeltsin facing tremendous challenges both politically and economically."</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>When Japan announced this week that the Russian Foreign Minister would attend next week's meeting of senior officials from the wealthiest industrial nations, the news set off a furious debate among Government officials here. The issue was not how democracy could be fostered in Russia, but whether Japan would be able to use the visit to press Moscow to return a group of islands seized at the close of World War II.</p> <p>The chief cabinet secretary, Yohei Kono, first said the territorial issue would not be raised, since the point of the meeting is to provide financial support for the programs of the beleaguered Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin. But later Mr. Kono abruptly changed course, saying the long-sought northern islands might be discussed when the Japanese and Russian foreign ministers meet separately.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'law and legislation']	<p>In the wake of his victory at the polls, President Boris Yeltsin seems to be doing a very smart thing. He's giving the surly Parliament, dominated by ex-Communists, a chance to negotiate its own suicide -- before he tries to kill it outright.</p> <p>"If there is a one-in-a-thousand chance that the present deputies will accept the referendum results and take this path of constitutional reform,  [ we ]  are obliged to give them this chance," was how Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai explained step one. Then came the twist into step two: "I'm not saying it will necessarily work."</p>

['elections', 'ethics']	<p>Just three days before a referendum on Boris N.

Pavel S. Grachev were made by Valentin G. Stepankov, the Procurator General of Russia, whose job is roughly that of an attorney general in the United States. They came only days after Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who has broken with Mr. Yeltsin, accused various Yeltsin officials of corruption.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Dr. David W. Strangway and his wife, Alice, had to give up their rambling, 7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style home on a magnificent promontory above the sea in western Vancouver this week. But they have no hard feelings.</p> <p>"We're actually thrilled," said Dr. Strangway, an Ontario-born geophysicist who studied moon rocks for NASA and is now the president of the University of British Columbia. "What a privilege to be able to say it happened here."</p>
['public opinion', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Declaring that the United States "cannot stop investing in the peace now that we have obtained it," President Clinton today began the arduous task of convincing Americans preoccupied with domestic woes that it is also necessary to help restore the economy of Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, laid the groundwork for the summit meeting he will hold with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this weekend by signaling that he does not intend to neglect concerns at home.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>Making his first political move since his triumph in Sunday's referendum, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia summoned regional leaders to Moscow today to receive a new draft constitution that would strengthen the presidency and eliminate the Congress of People's Deputies, which had led the attacks on him.</p> <p>Clearly seeking to bypass the Congress, Mr. Yeltsin asked the 88 regional leaders to name two representatives to a constituent assembly, which would wrap up a new constitution that would be somewhat modeled on the French system. The Congress has supreme powers under the current Constitution, which dates to the era of Leonid I. Brezhnev.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>Finance ministers from the major industrialized nations urged President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today to use his victory in the referendum last weekend to press ahead faster with reforms to create a market economy.</p> <p>After the finance ministers met in Washington, several officials said Russia would be able to take maximum advantage of the $28 billion in aid that the Group of Seven promised it only if it pushed rapidly ahead with change.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>When an American President enters a war, widens a war or prolongs a war, it becomes his war.</p> <p>It makes no difference who started it. Japan, North Korea and Iraq started wars that became the center of life and office for Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Bush. Neither Presidents Johnson nor Nixon started the war in Vietnam but it became theirs from the moment of their oaths.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The summit meeting between President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Clinton was the first item tonight on "Itogi," Russia's popular and respected news and commentary program, but the focus was not summitry or foreign aid. Rather, it was the political crisis that rocked the country last week and its likely impact on the April 25 constitutional referendum.</p> <p>After the high drama of Mr. Yeltsin's showdown with the Congress of People's Deputies, the meetings in Vancouver, British Columbia, seem tame and distant to many Russians. Add to this the fact that no Russian newspapers come out on Sundays, and it is understandable that the first day and a half of news from Vancouver has received only cursory treatment.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>"April is the cruelest month," wrote the poet T. S. Eliot, ". . . mixing Memory and desire."</p> <p>In the April that features the first global presidential campaign, Boris Yeltsin is reminding both his compatriots and former superpower competitors of the threat to freedom of revanchist apparatchiks, while fanning the desire "to move from general assurances to pragmatic, specific acts."</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Vancouver may well be remembered as the first quality-of-life summit meeting -- a couple of world leaders up to their necks in debt, dwelling more on materialism than on the military, and on standards of living rather than life and death.</p> <p>The meeting had all the drama of a bankrupt businessman applying for a bridge loan from the president of a failing S. & L. In part, this was due to the fundamental change in the relationship between Moscow and Washington since the end of the cold war. Before, Russian leaders presented their American counterparts with a threat. Now, they just present them with a bill.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Clinton today threw his full political support behind Boris N. Yeltsin in Russia's fateful political struggle and pledged a larger-than-expected $1.6 million in assistance intended to show "immediate and tangible" support for Russia's reforms.</p> <p>"Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it comes to democracy in Russia," Mr. Clinton pledged in a statement that drew on Walt Whitman to bolster the President's insistence that it was the "high duty" of the world's democracies to rise to Russia's support.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The affable Boris and Bill Show nearly collapsed in a fit of hurt feelings at dinner on Saturday night over a misunderstood pronoun.</p> <p>At a trendy nouvelle Vancouver restaurant called Seasons, overlooking the beautiful harbor, the two leaders sipped chardonnay, ate Dungeness crab ravioli and broiled salmon and talked business.</p>
['foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>While there were arguments here today over how much of the $28 billion in aid pledged by the wealthy industrial nations will reach Russia quickly, there were fewer doubts about another group likely to benefit: foreign businesses eager to finance risky operations in Russia.</p> <p>No sooner had the delegates to the conference on Russian aid handed out fact sheets explaining their complex new program, than they moved on to the issue of expanding trade and developing jobs -- in their own countries.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council is expected to hold an emergency session on Friday to consider imposing tough new sanctions on Yugoslavia immediately if the besieged Bosnian town of Srebrenica falls to Serbian forces.</p> <p>"I would definitely convene the Council, and I personally think we should move ahead immediately with the new sanctions," Jamsheed K. A. Marker of Pakistan, this month's Council president, said after reports that the Bosnian defenders of Srebrenica are negotiating the town's surrender.</p>
['elections']	<p>Campaigning at full tilt for the national referendum now 10 days away, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out today at his Vice President, the legislature and the chairmen of the Central Bank and the Constitutional Court.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's stage today was a meeting at the Bolshoi Theater with supporters from the creative intelligentsia. On two preceding days, the President visited with miners in Siberia and spoke to reporters in the Kremlin, aggressively attacking his detractors and asking for support in the April 25 referendum.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Seeking to help President Boris N. Yeltsin's political fortunes, the leading industrialized nations committed themselves today to $28 billion in aid for Russia, most intended to be delivered this year, although much of it was contingent on austerity steps that Moscow may find difficult to adopt.</p> <p>Most of the package announced today is to be provided by various international lending agencies, not the United States Treasury. But it did include about $2 billion in United States credits or loan guarantees to pay for Russian imports of American goods, and separately the Administration announced a new commitment of $1.8 billion in direct aid that seems likely to require Congressional approval.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'public opinion']	<p>That Boris N. Yeltsin won a vote of confidence in the national referendum three weeks ago, nobody denies. But what that means is a matter of sharp debate.</p> <p>Ardent supporters of radical change, who had hoped that the President would seize on the victory to sweep aside the bothersome legislative opposition and to ram through sweeping market reforms, have been disappointed.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Under preliminary plans being drawn up by NATO military authorities, American and allied peacekeeping forces are to sweep into Sarajevo and other key Bosnian cities before fanning out into the Bosnian countryside to police a new peace accord.</p> <p>The initial troops sent to Sarajevo would be the vanguard of a force of more than 50,000, which is to include about 20,000 to 25,000 American troops, according to Western diplomats and military officials. Other European officials said that the United States has advised NATO that it is prepared eventually to contribute up to 34,000 troops.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>THE top nuclear weapon designers of East and West, who for decades labored in secret to devise better ways of destroying each other's homelands with radioactive fire, are teaming up to conduct a joint scientific experiment for the first time.</p> <p>The collaboration in basic science, to begin this summer, is seen as a post-cold-war milestone. While many East-West partnerships have formed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, including a few among scientists with atomic skills, no experimental work has yet involved the highly specialized researchers who usually devote themselves to devising new kinds of nuclear armaments.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>A day after President Clinton said he expected to produce "a common approach" with Europe soon on stronger action in Bosnia, Washington and its allies were increasingly at odds today over precisely what the next steps should be.</p> <p>The Clinton Administration, officials said, would like to move ahead quickly with some form of military action that could pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace settlement. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher reported to President Clinton today that the Europeans -- particularly Russia -- wanted to wait and see if a Bosnian Serb referendum scheduled for May 15 and 16 resulted in a vote in favor of the settlement. This might spare the Europeans -- and the United States -- from having to take any military action.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>After riot policemen and pro-Communist demonstrators battled Saturday in the worst disturbance in Moscow since the failed coup attempt in August 1991, Russia's politicians maneuvered today to try to turn the violence to advantage.</p> <p>The Chairman of the conservative Parliament, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, ordered an investigation into the "use of force against the participants in a peaceful demonstration." Supporters of President Boris N. Yeltsin urged Mr. Yeltsin to deal harshly with the "provocateurs" who went after the police with staves, spears and steel bars.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Clinton Administration is now telling the Europeans it is willing to use air power to protect United Nations peacekeeping forces guarding safe havens for Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But President Clinton reiterated his opposition to any American soldiers participating on the ground while the war continues, even as part of the peacekeeping effort.</p> <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher informed the Europeans of the shift in the American position in meetings with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia on Thursday and with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain today, senior European officials said. The shift is also reflected in a draft statement of principles, written by Mr. Christopher as a basis for an anticipated joint announcement by the allies, the officials said.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A plan for creating well-guarded Muslim safe havens in Bosnia approved by the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Spain last weekend has been skeptically received by other Security Council members and still appeared today to lack the nine votes needed for adoption by its 15 members.</p> <p>As a result, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has proposed reconvening the London peace conference on Yugoslavia, an unwieldy group of more than 30 nations, in an effort to define a new and more comprehensive approach to ending the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Despite all their reluctance to agree with the United States about military steps to stop the killing in the Balkans, what the European allies have really wanted from President Clinton is firm leadership now that he has consulted with them.</p> <p>More than one European diplomat has said in recent conversations that Mr. Clinton should stop asking them their opinion on what he plans to do and start telling them instead what he plans to go ahead with, preferably with their support.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin went on television today to claim his victory in the April 25 referendum and to condemn the "irreconcilable opposition" for the clash with the police in Moscow on May Day.</p> <p>But beyond vague promises of "the most decisive measures," Mr. Yeltsin announced no new actions.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return home on Friday without winning an endorsement of President Clinton's proposal for the use of military force to curb Serbian aggression in Bosnia, despite the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of an international peace agreement.</p> <p>French, British and Russian leaders all agreed with Mr. Christopher's view that they must jointly take tougher action against the Bosnian Serbs. But none embraced what senior British and French officials described as the core of the American plan: the selective lifting of the United Nations arms embargo so that the United States and its allies can arm the Bosnian Muslim Government.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>Japanese officials reacted with barely veiled anger and exasperation today when they learned that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia had once again abruptly canceled a visit to Tokyo, for the second time in eight months.</p> <p>Like Mr. Yeltsin's last cancellation, Japanese officials first heard about it over the television rather than through diplomatic channels. And while both countries attempted to lay the blame on scheduling problems, officials here made it clear that the trip had been scuttled largely after it became clear that no progress would be made toward resolving the dispute over the fate of the four Kurile islands that were seized by the former Soviet Union in the last days of World War II.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Insisting that the President of Serbia still backed the international peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina despite its rejection by Bosnian Serbs, Russia's Foreign Minister said today that he hoped the United States would yet agree to a Security Council meeting to carry out the plan.</p> <p>The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia here after seeing the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, in the Adriatic resort of Split. Mr. Kozyrev said that the Croatian leader agreed to accept an international monitoring force along the Croatian-Bosnian border.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States and Russia agreed today to forge a common strategy with other European nations that accepts, at least for the moment, the territorial gains made by the Serbs in Bosnia.</p> <p>The goal would no longer be to roll back any of the gains achieved by the Bosnian Serbs in 14 months of fighting, but rather, in the words of a senior Administration official, "to contain and stabilize the situation and to put the brakes on the killing."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>After months of discord and vacillation, the United States, Russia and key European allies agreed today on a joint strategy devised to contain the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to guard enclaves of Muslim civilians besieged by Serbian nationalists there.</p> <p>The plan, announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, Russia and Spain after a brief meeting here, calls for the United States to use air power if necessary to protect United Nations peacekeepers guarding six Bosnian towns that have been designated "safe havens" by the United Nations Security Council. Issue Goes to Security Council</p> <p>But the size and duties of the peacekeeping mission will have to be decided by the Security Council, and Mr. Christopher did not specify what American aircraft would be authorized to do. That means that no use of American military force is imminent.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A new round of peace talks on the Balkans began today at this resort south of Athens amid hopes that the Bosnian Serbs would agree to an international plan to end the yearlong civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p> <p>Arriving at Athens airport today, Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said peace could come "within two weeks" if minor modifications were made to the plan. On Friday, Dr. Karadzic said he hoped to bring back a modified version of the original peace plan put forward by the United Nations and European Community that the Bosnian Serb assembly would accept when it meets in Pale, Bosnia, on Wednesday. Both the Croatian leadership in Bosnia and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government have already accepted the plan.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Despite the apparent lack of progress in a week of diplomatic consultations, President Clinton said today that he expected to produce "a common approach" with Europe soon on a strategy to bring the Bosnian Serbs to the peace table.</p> <p>"There's still some disagreement around the edges about what the overall specific tactical steps should be," Mr. Clinton told reporters after a meeting at the White House with representatives of the European Community. "But I think there's a lot more agreement than you think, and I think in the next few days we'll see a common approach emerging."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Angry and feeling betrayed by an American, Russian and European strategy aimed at curbing the fighting in this war-ravaged country, Bosnia's Muslim President today rejected the plan as "absolutely unacceptable."</p> <p>The plan, announced in Washington on Saturday, effectively rules out international military intervention for the time being against the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of the country.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Security Council plans to approve the modest new Western strategy for containing the war in Bosnia this week, but diplomats said today that the vote would not remove obstacles like an inadequate number of peacekeeping troops or resistance from Serbs and Muslims.</p> <p>The Council plans to adopt three resolutions endorsing the "step by step" approach to curbing the fighting, which was hammered out by the United States, Russia and key European allies on Saturday after months of indecision and discord.</p>
['finances']	<p>With United Nations peacekeeping costs expected to rise by more than a third this year to $3.7 billion, the failure of member countries to pay their share is raising doubts about the organization's ability to finance future operations or adequately sustain peace efforts under way now in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.</p> <p>Officials here say governments of many developing countries are angry because the United Nations has failed to reimburse them fully for the cost of the troops they send on peacekeeping missions. In some cases those countries are withdrawing forces or refusing to take part in new operations.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States said today that it would not attend a Security Council meeting of foreign ministers on the war in Bosnia.</p> <p>Underscoring a rift with its European allies, the United States said it could not support pushing ahead to implement a peace plan that relied on the cooperation of Bosnian Serbs, who appear strongly opposed to the idea.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Taking its most visible international role since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is trying to fill the policy vacuum left by President Clinton's decision to yield to European opposition and shelve his plan to bomb the Serbs and arm the Bosnian Muslims.</p> <p>The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, after a tour of Europe and the Balkans to try to organize support for a new Russian initiative, will meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Thursday in Washington. Mr. Kozyrev wants to begin carrying out the Vance-Owen peace plan despite formal Bosnian Serb opposition, an approach that has brought skepticism from Washington.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>As part of its campaign to forge a new relationship with the West, Russia promised today to contribute troops to an international peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina if a peace agreement goes into effect there.</p> <p>[ Moscow made the commitment just hours before the Bosnian Serbs' assembly voted early Thursday to reject the plan offered by United Nations and European Community mediators. ]</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Even as the Bosnian Serbs debated the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States and the United Nations were at odds today over who would control the troops enforcing it.</p> <p>For the moment, the matter is moot, because the assembly of Bosnia Serbs voted late tonight -- early Thursday morning in Bosnia -- to reject the peace plan.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>A 25-year-old riot policeman, wounded during clashes between the police and pro-Communist demonstrators on Saturday, died in a Moscow hospital today, becoming the first victim of political violence in the capital since the failed coup in August 1991.</p> <p>The death of Vladimir Tolokneyev, a member of the Interior Ministry's special OMON unit who was crushed between two trucks during the rioting, is bound to raise tensions in Moscow as the city prepares for another major political demonstration on Sunday, the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons']	<p>With a Congressional moratorium on nuclear testing due to expire on July 1, President Clinton is expected to approve a plan that would allow underground blasts to resume by the end of the year, Administration officials said today.</p> <p>But the officials said Mr. Clinton was likely to emphasize that he intended to call a final halt to the testing in 1996.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States has imposed sanctions on Russian companies for selling missile technology in violation of international export controls, Clinton Administration officials said today.</p> <p>But the sanctions have been waived until mid-July while Washington and Moscow make a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Providing an extraordinarily frank glimpse of struggles in the Government to stabilize the economy, the Finance Minister directed criticism tonight at his Cabinet colleagues, at the persistence of "pseudo-Soviet thinking" and at the "financial tourism" of Western business executives who visit but do not invest.</p> <p>The official, Boris G. Fyodorov, 35, is considered the leading economic reformer in the Government and the most tireless proponent of financial and monetary discipline. But he described a Government in which his small band of Westernized economists are fighting a constant battle against colleagues who wish to restore many of the plans and price controls of the Soviet era, in which they were trained.</p>
['space', 'space stations']	<p>The expert panel advising the White House on redesigning the space-station has called for the proposed astronaut outpost to be launched into a "world orbit" where it could be reached not only by American space shuttles but also by Russian, Japanese and Chinese rockets.</p> <p>The recommendation by the White House group for a different orbit is in a draft report to the White House that has not yet released. If kept in the final report and adopted by President Clinton, the shift would be a watershed in the history of the American space program.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>On any given day, the various strands of St. Petersburg's myriad Communist, nationalist, even fascist movements come together by the wooden fence that surrounds an old merchants' emporium, Gostini Dvor, on Nevsky Prospekt in the heart of the old city.</p> <p>There, young nationalists and aging Communists mingle peacefully beneath wall art that features handwritten quotes from Lenin or more current idols of the ultra-patriots, behind tables stacked with copies of Pravda, the old Communist Party daily, or newer publications like Russian Order, Russian Cause, To the Ax and Nationalist, each trying to outdo the others in proving that this or that member of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government is Jewish, a paid agent of the C.I.A., or both.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>With rare unanimity, the European allies reacted with approval today to the United States missile strike against Iraq.</p> <p>Britain, Italy and Germany, all of whose leaders were apparently informed about the plans shortly before the strike began, all gave strong backing to the move today despite reports of civilian casualties.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>In a blunt expression of differences between Russia and the United States over policy toward nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, today criticized an American plan to place Ukraine's warheads under international control.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Defense Secretary Les Aspin in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, General Grachev said the nuclear warheads left in Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union were Russian and should remain under Russian control.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Back in May, when political analysts and even the White House budget director were making dire predictions about the fate of President Clinton's Russian aid package, David Nagle, a former Iowa Congressman, figured about 40 people would come to a meeting to put together a lobbying strategy for the program.</p> <p>About 90 showed up.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States is trying to block the shipment of rocket-fuel ingredients from Russia to Libya, officials said today. The shipment is the latest in a string of exports that have caused major worry in the Clinton Administration.</p> <p>With a deteriorating economy, Russia has been increasingly dependent on military sales to earn hard currency.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Japan's Foreign Minister, Kabun Muto, said today that a Clinton Administration proposal to create a $4 billion fund to help turn Russia's state-owned enterprises into private companies was "preposterous," and added that an agreement had been reached to scale the fund back to about $500 million.</p> <p>The proposal was made in April during a meeting here of the finance and foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrial democracies. The meeting produced an agreement to provide $28 billion in aid to support Russia's transition to a capitalist economy, but the $4 billion fund was not part of that total.</p>
['treaties', 'religion and churches', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Concerned about instability along Russia's southern frontier, Russian military officials have told the Clinton Administration that they would like to revise the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe so they can put more forces in the region.</p> <p>The Russian request was conveyed to Defense Secretary Les Aspin by Gen. Pavel E. Grachev, the Russian Defense Minister, when they met this week in Germany. But a senior Administration official said Washington was not interested in reopening the treaty, fearing that such a move might lead to a general unraveling of the accord.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'international trade and world market']	<p>With trade issues deadlocked and resistance building to American aid strategy for Russia just days before the economic summit meeting in Tokyo, the Clinton Administration has turned its attention to the group's political declaration as a way of making the meeting a success.</p> <p>"There's less progress on the economic side than the political side, so we're focusing on things we can control," a senior Administration official said.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council today defeated a resolution, supported only by the United States and five nonaligned countries, that would have lifted the arms embargo against the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government. Britain, France and Russia abstained in a successful effort to defeat the measure.</p> <p>Six countries voted in favor of the resolution; the other nine members of the Council abstained. In order to pass, the resolution needed eight votes in favor.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi stepped up his attacks on President Boris N. Yeltsin today and called on the Russian Parliament to disband his Government "completely and immediately."</p> <p>Mr. Rutskoi's new offensive came as Russia's warring political factions head into a major battle over a new constitution, which Mr. Yeltsin will put on the table this weekend at a specially summoned conference. The conference, which opens on Saturday, was expanded today, as Mr. Yeltsin ordered each of the Russian Federation's 88 regions and territories to double their representation.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Serbian leaders here and in Bosnia are now acting with increasing confidence, sensing that they have out-bluffed Europe, Russia and the United States, and no longer see any major obstacles to their drive for hegemony in former Yugoslavia.</p> <p>This is the conclusion of foreign diplomats here and a number of Serbs, who say recent events have made it clear that the major powers have no stomach for direct military intervention in the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration said today that a $4 billion international fund it proposed to help Russian state enterprises convert to private businesses would have to be shrunk because Japan and the Western European allies are too squeezed for cash to join.</p> <p>"We are doing some serious arm-twisting on the Japanese and Europeans to try to salvage as much as possible," a senior Administration official said. "People understand that the idea is not a bad idea, but they keep saying to us: Where are we going to come up with this dough?"</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>The United States is pressing the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations to set up an office in Moscow to coordinate Western aid, but Britain and France oppose the idea, Western officials said this week.</p> <p>The goal of the plan is to give the seven nations a more effective and aggressive role in distributing aid to Russia, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Meeting with President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine at a country house outside Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin today confirmed Russia's willingness to give Ukraine security guarantees.</p> <p>The guarantees would come as the Ukrainian Parliament considers ratification of the first strategic arms treaty, known as Start I, and a related vote on the country's non-nuclear status.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>As a constitutional conference intended to chart Russia's political future opened today, the chairman of Russia's Parliament stormed out, accusing President Boris N. Yeltsin of pushing ahead with a new constitution that would move the country toward a dictatorship.</p> <p>The departure of the chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, who was followed by about 50 other delegates, cast a pall over prospects for the smooth adoption of the country's first post-Communist constitution, an effort that Mr. Yelstin described as "a most important watershed in the life in the Russian state."</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin sent Russia's constitutional conference back for a third round of work today, confirming that major differences remained between Moscow and the outlying regions over the basic political shape of a proposed federation.</p> <p>Speaking briefly at a full session of the 700 delegates, Mr. Yeltsin declared that the "intensive work" of the conference had succeeded in crafting a single draft from competing documents and innumerable proposals.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'treaties']	<p>The three main Slavic states that dominated the old Soviet Union and effectively dissolved it in December 1991 have decided to press ahead with an economics and customs union, including coordinated economic policies.</p> <p>Last weekend, after secretive meetings in a rest house outside Moscow, the Prime Ministers of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine announced agreement on the principles of economic integration and a "single economic space," with a draft treaty embodying that agreement to be ready by Sept. 1.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Heavy shelling from Armenian forces in central Azerbaijan set off a wave of refugees and augured another Armenian advance into Azerbaijan as warfare spiraled across the Caucasus.</p> <p>Having now secured virtually all of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which has been the focus of the longest ethnic war in the former Soviet Union, the Armenians appeared to be clearing a swath along the Azerbaijani side of the border, presumably as a security zone.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space']	<p>India said today that it would develop powerful rocket technology that it says it has been denied as a result of an accord between Washington and Moscow.</p> <p>"The Government of India will not allow any setback to India's space technology and space program," the Foreign Office said in an official statement.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Traveling in Russia recently as a writer, I came quickly to feel like a spy -- not a foreign agent for America, but a spy for each emerging social class to the others.  Members of the Russian mafia -- the organized-crime circle -- were fascinated to hear that intellectuals think the criminal class exerts social influence. The intelligentsia were obsessed with the greed of the new rich businessmen, whom they blame for the end of heroic idealism. A return to the Orthodox Church has left homosexuals worried about repressive neo-conservatism; nightclub owners are wondering whether the artists who flourished underground can survive in the new daylight. Politicians wonder whether power will remain in the hands of government or will devolve to these chaotic elements. Within all these social strata, the changes are most clear among members of the younger generation.</p> <p>Overall, their outlook is harsh indeed. According to an article in the mainstream newspaper Argumenty i Fakty in April, "Young Russian malcontents are considering suicide every second." One-third want to leave the country. Since 1989, the birth rate has dropped 30 percent, as discouraged young people choose not to have children. Even so, some young Russians are plunging ahead with often-decadent abandon to find freedom, wealth and power, defying the timidity, and idealism, of the older generation.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>American and Russian negotiators are close to a compromise in a bitter rift over the Russian sale of missile technology to India in violation of international export controls, senior State Department officials said today.</p> <p>The two sides remained locked in intense discussions tonight in an effort to avoid the automatic imposition of American sanctions against Russian and Indian companies involved in the deal. The sanctions were scheduled to go into effect at midnight, but senior officials said that they were close to a settlement and that discussions would likely continue on Friday.</p>
['religion and churches', 'law and legislation']	<p>At the urging of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Russian Parliament passed a measure on Wednesday restricting the activities of foreign religious groups here.</p> <p>The measure was apparently aimed at controlling the activities of foreign evangelical preachers and of sects like the Hare Krishna. They regularly hold mass meetings in stadiums or appear on television, to the growing irritation and consternation of the established Orthodox Church.</p>
['foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>Revising its aid proposals for the former Soviet Union, the Clinton Administration has told the Senate that it wants to get American companies more involved in efforts to build a private sector and to expand money allocated for republics other than Russia.</p> <p>The new proposal came in the form of a request for $2.5 billion in appropriations sent to the Senate Thursday night and intended to carry out the Administration's aid pledges for Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Russian Parliament recessed for the summer today after rushing through an extraordinary string of measures. If put into force, they threaten to disrupt the economy, undermine the turning over of public property to private interests, fracture relations with Ukraine, jail a key Yeltsin aide and, among many other things, expand the privileges of the legislators.</p> <p>The long list ranges from a budget that is twice as large as anticipated revenues to little-noticed actions like closing K.G.B. archives for an extra 20 years. It includes a declaration claiming the Crimean port of Sevastopol to be Russian, not Ukrainian -- and another condemning the United Nations Security Council for denouncing the measure.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>The constitutional conference called by President Boris N. Yeltsin last month formally approved the draft of a new constitution today, but prospects for its acceptance any time soon were dimmed by a growing rivalries among the provinces and ethnic republics that make up the Russian Federation.</p> <p>The final draft was not immediately made public, but its broad outlines have already become known: a presidential republic with a two-house parliament and extensive restraints on each branch of government.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reached a major accord this morning on a hard-fought "framework" for resolving a series of mounting trade disputes between the two nations. Mr. Clinton said it committed Japan to bring about "a highly significant reduction" in Japan's huge trade surpluses with the United States and the world.</p> <p>The accord was announced after negotiations that lasted all night -- including a decisive 2 a.m. meeting in the President's hotel suite -- and hours after the Group of Seven summit meeting ended Friday, with Mr. Clinton declaring that his first major effort to create jobs through international trade negotiations had been a success.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday in Tokyo after the 19th summit meeting by the Group of Seven industrial nations, as recorded by the Associated Press: STATEMENT</p> <p>The summit we have concluded sends a message of hope to America and to the world.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>The Russian Parliament passed a resolution today declaring the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, which is within Ukraine, to be a Russian city.</p> <p>The resolution was not likely to have much impact, since Ukraine has no intention of ceding Sevastopol and President Boris N. Yeltsin, who is in Tokyo attending the Group of Seven meeting, is unlikely to try to enforce it.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia announced today that they will meet in Moscow for their second formal summit conference, probably later this year.</p> <p>The two men conferred for more than an hour today after the conclusion of the summit meeting of the leaders of the world's seven leading industrial democracies and pronounced themselves pleased with the outcome of Mr. Yeltsin's appearance at the meeting.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Arriving at the economic summit meeting as leaders of the seven leading industrial nations were preparing a new aid package for his country, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia offered unusually conciliatory words today in an effort to warm decades of icy relations with Japan.</p> <p>The financial package, announced as a near certainty late today by Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen, includes funds for training, grants and loans to help put Russia's state-owned companies into private hands.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Under pressure from the United States, Russia agreed today to halt its planned sale of equipment and technology to India that American experts said could be used to make a ballistic missile, the State Department announced today.</p> <p>In a compromise that ended a bitter year-long dispute, the United States won Russian approval for the halt of the sale in return for waiving economic sanctions that had been set to go into effect today against two Russian companies involved in the deal.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton's national security aides have recommended that the United States adopt a more assertive role in United Nations peacekeeping operations, Administration officials said tonight.</p> <p>The recommendation, in a classified draft of a Presidential directive, also calls for Washington to take a more active diplomatic role in seeking to resolve disputes within and among the former Soviet republics, the officials said. The recommendations were first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed later by the officials.</p>
['terrorism', 'medicine and health', 'accidents and safety']	<p>The execution of one of the biggest killers in history, the smallpox virus, is being planned for the end of this year.</p> <p>The virus's death sentence comes 13 years after the World Health Organization declared that it had eradicated smallpox, a disease that killed, blinded and disfigured uncounted millions of people. The organization's global vaccination campaign broke the chain of person-to-person transmission of the disease, which occurred only in humans.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>When President Clinton returns to Washington on Sunday from his vacation, he is expected to approve a Presidential directive that would set out the United States' policy toward peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, beset by ethnic and nationalist strife.</p> <p>But this attempt by the United States to clarify its role in keeping the peace in the post-cold-war world has had unintended consequences, prompting an angry reaction among Russians opposed to President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Looking for a way to break out of a tense political standoff, President Boris N. Yeltsin warned his legislative opposition today that he was prepared to call early parliamentary elections this fall, whether the members wanted them or not.</p> <p>Such a step could force Russia into another constitutional crisis since the President now lacks the authority to dissolve the Parliament on his own, and the Parliament -- whose term is supposed to end in 1995 -- is increasingly inclined to hang onto its seats until next spring at the earliest.</p>
['ethics']	<p>A presidential commission investigating charges of high-level corruption accused Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi today of involvement with a Swiss bank account containing millions of dollars of state funds.</p> <p>The charges, made at a nationally televised news conference, were a particularly vivid example of how politics is played these days in Russia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances']	<p>The struggle and drift in Russian economic policy was particularly vivid today, as President Boris N. Yeltsin convened an expanded meeting of his divided Government in the Kremlin while the Parliament was busy suspending his privatization program for the second time in a month.</p> <p>As a measure of the state of affairs, it was considered a victory for the market-oriented wing of the Government that the industrialist Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, did not throw his support behind a Soviet-style effort by the Economics Ministry to resurrect the essentials of centralized planning.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'ethics']	<p>The spectacle of senior Russian officials hurling mud at one another, alleging corruption without evidence and citing documents that they refuse to release, is undermining the already weak authority of the state.</p> <p>Russia is paralyzed by open conflict between the executive and legislative branches and the inability to agree on a new Constitution or new elections. But if the warfare were merely between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament, led by the Speaker, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the current battle would have the somewhat tedious character of the recent past.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin moved today to isolate the defiant Parliament and tighten pressure on the maverick deputies. Parliament attempted to fight back by convening an emergency session of the full Congress of People's Deputies.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, moving to consolidate his power after dissolving Parliament Tuesday night and calling elections for a new legislature in December, issued a decree taking control of all parliamentary newspapers, radio and television programs and rescinding the lawmakers' diplomatic travel passes. He also set a date for new presidential elections six months after the voting for a new legislature.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>In what Clinton Administration officials said was a strong signal of support for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, the Senate today overwhelmingly approved a 1994 foreign aid bill that includes $2.5 billion for Moscow.</p> <p>The bill, which contains $12.5 billion in foreign aid programs, passed by a vote of 88 to 10 after Administration officials argued that failure to approve the measure, or the attachment of restrictions to the Russia aid, would seriously undermine Mr. Yeltsin, who is locked in a power struggle with the Russian Parliament.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The danger of a rift within the Russian military makes it unlikely that supporters of President Boris N. Yeltsin will ask the armed forces to intervene in his current struggle with Parliament, Russian military experts and Western diplomats say.</p> <p>For now, even a military that is neutral appears sufficient to help Mr. Yeltsin, who says he has no intention of using force to subdue the Parliament. But Russian scholars and Western diplomats said that Mr. Yeltsin's restraint could also reflect concern about the risk of an open battle for their loyalty.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin received crucial pledges of support today from leaders of Russia's military and police forces, while opposition members of Parliament issued a stream of defiant resolutions against them.</p> <p>There was no change in the basic situation since the startling developments of Tuesday, when Mr. Yeltsin ordered the disbanding of the Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, which includes many Communists and nationalists opposed to Mr. Yeltsin's policies.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Governments and politicians around the world have lined up solidly behind President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with the Russian Parliament, declaring that only he could bring a measure of political stability and hope for economic reforms.</p> <p>Western leaders appeared to have swallowed discomfort at Mr. Yeltsin's suspension of Parliament, finding ample solace in his call for new legislative elections to be held in mid-December.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>"Our people look at Moscow like a spectacle, some kind of show, and they treat it like that," said the chairman of the Podolsk City Council. "They wonder how many times someone can step on a rake. That Russia still exists at all is due only to the sober-minded people in the provinces."</p> <p>Aleksei A. Umansky was holding forth just before an open council meeting in this industrial city of 210,000, some 30 miles south of Moscow, called urgently to deliberate the city's stance toward the dual developments of the night before -- President Boris N. Yeltsin's disbanding of the federal Parliament and Parliament's election of Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi to replace Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Senior Clinton Administration officials and top American lawmakers agreed today that the $2.5 billion American aid package for Russia now being considered by Congress should move ahead quickly as a tangible sign of support for President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>A day after Mr. Yeltsin dissolved Parliament and called new elections, the Clinton Administration has settled comfortably into a policy that officials summarize as business as usual with Mr. Yeltsin and the back of the hand for his opponents. The general feeling within the Administration was confidence that Mr. Yeltsin would prevail, coupled with a fasten-your-seat-belts attitude that this sort of power struggle is going to be a feature of political life in Russia for years to come.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The lights were on all over the Russian Parliament building tonight. Groups of men, some with guns, hung about the lobbies. The cafeterias were open for service. Aides rode the elevators, bearing stacks of newly issued decrees, but according to the man guarding the door to the third-floor presidential suite, Russia's most recently sworn-in President had left the building.</p> <p>The guard said Aleksandr V. Rutskoi -- still referred to by most Russians as their vice president -- would be back shortly. He had spent last night inside the White House, now headquarters for Russia's one-day-old, self-anointed parallel Government. And given the uncertainties of the country's political situation, he was sure to return to his command post before long, if only for security's sake.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>By dissolving Parliament and scheduling early elections, President Boris Yeltsin has thrown Russia into one of its periodic fits of political uncertainty. Yet the "crisis" is very peculiar. For all the supposed drama of the confrontation, the most important political forces all have the same interest: to see Mr. Yeltsin succeed. If he holds on to his strength, Russia may turn a crucial corner in creating democratic institutions.</p> <p>Two groups will be among the arbiters of the confrontation: the military and the heads of provincial governments. Since the failed coup of August 1991, Russia's generals have sought to keep their institution out of politics and have largely succeeded. They say the politicians should sort out their differences.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Two weeks ago, the President of Russia had a long telephone conversation with the President of the U.S. The Russian, who gave no hint of an intent to dissolve Parliament, wanted to know in detail about the progress of the aid package and repeal of trade restrictions; in turn, the American asked him to increase pressure on the Serbs and to withdraw troops from the Baltic States.</p> <p>A few days later, asked to assess Boris Yeltsin's political position, Bill Clinton said: "He is in a weaker position than he was, politically, right after he was elected -- because of his inability to work through an effective political compromise with his opponents." Should the U.S. be talking to his rival, Aleksandr Rutskoi? "I don't think we should be hedging our bets," replied Mr. Clinton.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin severely tightened the cordon around the headquarters of the hostile legislature Tuesday, deploying hundreds of troops with concertina wire and water trucks, and even mounted police, at all approaches to the building.</p> <p>From a yellow armored personnel carrier across the street from barricades erected by defenders of Parliament, police officers with a loudspeaker demanded that those inside surrender their arms today.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'public opinion']	<p>Ihor Volokhov is both a successful and a deeply disappointed man. He has a private shop with his wife that sells imported tea, coffee, lingerie, clothes and even wallpaper. He says he's working hard but living decently.</p> <p>But as for an independent Ukraine, he says, "I think it was a mistake."</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>In what sounded like a final ultimatum to the Russian Parliament, the national and city governments today ordered leaders of the legislature to evacuate the building and surrender all arms by Monday.</p> <p>The ultimatum came as a "demand" addressed to the two leaders of the holdout deputies, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov and Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who were warned that failure to comply could carry "grave consequences" for which they would bear "full responsibility."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin spent a cold but sunny morning in Red Square with thousands of ordinary Russian citizens today, listening to the revered cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich direct Washington's National Symphony Orchestra.</p> <p>Russia's other President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, spent his morning in the increasingly isolated Parliament building, where the long, echoing corridors are lit every 30 yards or so by a single fluorescent fixture run by a generator and where the offices have no lights at all.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Russian regional leaders meeting in St. Petersburg called today for simultaneous early elections for both President and Parliament to resolve the power struggle between the two sides.</p> <p>They proposed that both President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Congress of People's Deputies reverse their edicts dissolving or dismissing each other and that the legislature then turn its powers over to the Council of the Federation -- a body of regional leaders formed by Mr. Yeltsin -- until a new legislature is sworn in.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Finance ministers here for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund gave Russia a two-pronged message today: they support President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with Parliament, but they want him to move faster to reduce inflation and reform the economy.</p> <p>Voicing enthusiastic support for Mr. Yeltsin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told the ministers today, "Our task in this unfolding drama is to reinforce reform and its standard-bearers."</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The International Monetary Fund has decided to delay a $1.5 billion loan to Russia because of Moscow's failure to cut its inflation rate and carry out other promised reforms.</p> <p>But United States and fund officials said they were encouraged that the Russian Government has shown what they see as a stepped-up commitment to reform during the last few days, for instance in the appointment of former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar as a First Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'foreign aid', 'war and revolution']	<p>As shells fell almost constantly, the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, made a desperate appeal today for immediate international help to stop an offensive by Abkhazian separatists on this encircled city in western Georgia.</p> <p>Mr. Shevardnadze, who spent the day here trying to organize Sukhumi's defense, said: "I am appealing to you from Sukhumi, not knowing if my words will ever reach you.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space', 'russia-international relations-us', 'space stations']	<p>Formally ending decades of cold war rivalry in space, the United States and Russia agreed today to merge the hearts of their manned space programs, embarking on a joint effort to design and construct an international space station.</p> <p>In a separate agreement signed today by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Victor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia also agreed to place export controls on missile technology, a step the Administration had set as a condition to cooperation in space.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>American and Russian army divisions, which faced each other during the tense days of the cold war, will conduct joint peacekeeping exercises under an agreement the two countries signed today.</p> <p>The peacekeeping exercises, in both countries and in Europe, will involve the Third Infantry Division based in Frankfurt, Germany, and the 27th Motorized Rifle Division from the Volga District in Russia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>The new Prime Minister of Turkey held urgent talks in Moscow today, the latest in a flurry of diplomatic efforts as the five-year-old conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan threatens to draw in Turkey, Iran and Russia.</p> <p>The two-day visit by the Prime Minister, Tansu Ciller, followed a call by the Azerbaijani leader, Geidar A. Aliyev. And it coincided with the publication of a letter from Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressing great concern over the conflict and urging Armenians to adopt "a more constructive approach" toward its resolution.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>His hopes for military help dashed by President Clinton, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia turned his efforts today to soliciting Congressional support for American participation in a multinational peacekeeping force that would oversee the partition of his country if a peace accord is reached by its warring factions.</p> <p>In a meeting with members of Congress, Mr. Izetbegovic urged that the United States contribute a significant number of ground troops to such a force; that troops from Russia, a traditional ally of Serbs, be excluded, and that the commander of the Sarajevo region be an American.</p>
['elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin declared today that he was "categorically against" early simultaneous elections for President and Parliament, rejecting a proposal that has gathered growing support in the six days since Mr. Yeltsin opened his latest assault against the legislature.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's unyielding stance was echoed by leaders of holdout legislators in the increasingly dismal Parliament building, ringed by security forces and without electricity, telephones and hot water for three days now.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Abkhazian rebels captured their provincial capital today after an 11-day siege, sealing the break of the northwestern province with Georgia and dealing a devastating political blow to Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader. Mr. Shevardnadze had led the defense of the city and left only at the last moment.</p> <p>The Itar-Tass news agency reported that the Abkhazian flag was raised over the legislature in the capital, Sukhumi, at 1 P.M. Russian television reports from the Abkhazian side showed black smoke rising from several burning buildings as Abkhazian troops swept through the city center.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Declaring that the "irreconcilable opposition" of the Russian legislature, with its large number of Communists, had paralyzed his reforms and his ability to govern, President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered the group dissolved on Tuesday and called elections to a new parliament for December.</p> <p>Almost immediately, the Supreme Soviet voted by an overwhelming margin to depose Mr. Yeltsin and ordered security forces not to obey him.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'elections', 'law and legislation', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Clinton, taken by surprise by the events in Moscow, moved swiftly today to throw the support of the United States behind President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with the Russian Parliament.</p> <p>"I support him fully," Mr. Clinton said in a statement released by the White House late this afternoon after Mr. Clinton was able to hold a 17-minute telephone conversation with the Russian leader. And Mr. Clinton and other White House officials were in touch with European allies tonight to encourage them to issue similar statements of support for Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>The evening was still young when a police officer started putting up metal barriers in front of the White House, as the Russian Parliament building is known. It was, he said with a shrug, the most obvious thing to do under the circumstances.</p> <p>Two years and one month ago thousands of Muscovites rushed to the building after President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia stood atop a tank and defied a hard-line Communist coup.  On Tuesday at 8 P.M. the same President, now in the Kremlin, announced that he was disbanding Parliament. By 10 P.M. the parliamentary leadership -- now the defiant occupants of the White House -- had moved to oust Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Six months ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia threatened to declare presidential rule to break the power of the holdover Parliament and Soviet-era Constitution. But cautious, even hesitant about the breadth of his support, Mr. Yeltsin pulled back from the brink, from the whole racked and bloody history of single-man rule in Russia. He was nearly impeached for his pains.</p> <p>Tonight, after months of increasing political paralysis, an ever-weakening central authority and economic disarray, Mr. Yeltsin finally rolled the dice he had been juggling for so long. He declared presidential rule, ordered Parliament disbanded and called new elections for early December.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>As large contingents of police moved around the Parliament building, a rump Congress of People's Deputies that is meeting in defiance of President Boris N. Yeltsin appeared to be backing down today amid internal dissension.</p> <p>The Congress adjourned tonight after the first signs of a split in its leadership began to appear. The Parliament Speaker, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, survived a call for his resignation after Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi rose to his defense and accused some deputies of trying "to flee in good time and to betray in good time."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Two SU-25 fighter bombers flying from bases north of this beleaguered western Georgian city buzzed the Black Sea coast today, then bombed Georgian positions. And Abkhazian heavy artillery continued to bombing the city center, raising the number of dead and wounded into the middle hundreds.</p> <p>Because the separatist Abkhazian forces are not known to have planes, the jets are suspected of having flown out of Russian-controlled bases in northern Abkhazia or air bases in southern Russia. The Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, has accused Russia of complicity in the Abkhazian attacks.</p>
['religion and churches', 'foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'finances']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced yesterday that the United States would provide $250 million over two years to help carry out the Israeli-Palestinian accord and called for an early international conference to more than match the American pledge.</p> <p>The $250 million is only a preliminary estimate based on hasty conversations with Congress over the weekend, other senior Administration officials said. The United States is expected to present a more comprehensive five-year aid package at the conference, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 1 in Washington, they added.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia declared today that resistance by lawmakers isolated in the darkened and encircled Parliament building was "on its last gasp," while leaders of the opposition there issued defiant appeals for mass resistance.</p> <p>As Mr. Yeltsin's bid to disband the Congress of People's Deputies went into its fifth night, the scene grew more menacing at the monumental White House, as the riverfront headquarters of Parliament is known.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven leading industrial democracies expressed support today for Russia and for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, but the officials pledged no new aid for either.</p> <p>The ministers also reached no new plan to stimulate the sluggish world economy. American officials said this week that they were especially interested in increasing global economic growth through lower interest rates in Europe and Japan and possibly lower taxes in Japan. So the absence of any such deal was another sign that these periodic meetings play a dwindling role in international monetary policy.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'freedom and human rights', 'public opinion']	<p>The city known in Soviet times as "the Cradle of the Revolution" sat this one out, and there was none of the massed public support for President Boris N. Yeltsin that did much to discourage the coup leaders of August 1991.</p> <p>While Mr. Yeltsin disbanded the Parliament in Moscow and finally shelled it, the only demonstrations here were pro-Parliament and pro-Communist, and they were small.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>In his first address to the nation since army tanks crushed an uprising against him, President Boris N. Yeltsin called on Russians today to put the "nightmare of these black days" behind them, and affirmed that elections to a new Parliament will be held Dec. 12.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin also called for a purge of Russia's regional councils, many of which had sided with the Parliament's defiant leaders during the political crisis that led up to this week's violence. He said the local councils, or soviets, should peacefully dissolve themselves, and also prepare for new local elections, possibly in December.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>In the night before the final and fateful assault on the Parliament center, both the White House and the Kremlin, the headquarters of competing claims to Russia's power a scant three miles apart, seemed caught in illusion and indecision.</p> <p>In the Kremlin, a sparse weekend staff seemed to be caught entirely off guard by the eruption of an armed insurgency on Sunday led by extremists. President Boris N. Yeltsin flew in by helicopter only shortly before 7 P.M., when the cordon around the White House, as the Parliament building is known, was already breached and gunmen were setting off to attack the headquarters of the state television.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Moving to insure a clean sweep of Moscow politics, President Boris N. Yeltsin has decreed that the upper house of the new Parliament will be elected on Dec. 12, the same day that elections have been set for the lower house.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin signed the decree on Monday before leaving for Tokyo. The action appeared to be intended to further weaken the power of existing regional authorities, many of whom publicly resisted Mr. Yeltsin's suspension of the old Parliament, which led to the showdown that ended in Russian Army tanks firing on the Parliament building to put down an armed rebellion.</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'ethics']	<p>When the Soviet Union was disintegrating, one of the first statues of Lenin to be pulled down in Central Asia was in this sleepy capital. It was replaced by a statue of Abul Qasim Firdawsi, a 10th-century poet.</p> <p>Yet today, poets and writers are in jail or exile, and on tree-lined boulevards, neon hammer-and-sickle emblems hang from the lampposts.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>Empowered by an eight-day-old state of emergency, the Moscow police are using their extra powers as part of a wider crackdown on crime to conduct raids aimed at non-Russian minority groups throughout the city.</p> <p>According to complaints registered at local embassies of former Soviet republics and at the local office of Helsinki Watch, a human rights organization, police have staged nighttime sweeps of hotels, dormitories and apartments frequented by visitors from the Caucasus and Central Asia, and in cases when permits are not in order, forced them out of town, in some cases even paying their fare.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>A Russian naval ship dumped hundreds of tons of low-level nuclear waste into the the Sea of Japan over the weekend, touching off a sharp diplomatic dispute between Tokyo and Moscow today just after they had declared a new era of cooperation.</p> <p>Dumping radioactive materials into the ocean has been banned worldwide for more than 30 years, and a decade ago the prohibition was extended to low-level waste.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'bombs and explosives', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia has threatened to use its Security Council veto to block new sanctions that the United States, Britain and France want to impose on Libya for refusing to hand over two citizens accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, United Nations diplomats say.</p> <p>The strongly worded threat, made in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher that arrived last weekend, surprised and angered Administration officials. A total of 270 people died in the blast over Lockerbie, Scotland.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>President Clinton today blamed opponents of Boris N. Yeltsin for the violence in Moscow and vowed that the United States would not waver in its backing for the Russian President as he sought to restore order.</p> <p>A senior American official described events in Moscow as "a very, very serious crisis." But as the 13-day-old standoff lurched into the streets, Mr. Clinton made clear he had no intention of lessening his support for Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>As anti-Yeltsin demonstrators marched on the television headquarters on Sunday, Lidiya Naumovna watched in quiet disbelief.</p> <p>"My heart is pounding," the 52-year-old engineer said as opponents of President Boris N. Yeltsin moved along the Garden Ring road. "Something really horrible is happening."</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>For months now, as Moscow's political warriors have been locked in an increasingly vicious battle for power, each side has accused the other of pushing the country to civil war. Until Sunday, the threat always seemed idle, even in the days since President Boris N. Yeltsin disbanded Parliament and ringed its headquarters with troops.</p> <p>Like a deadly delayed reaction, the violence that swept Moscow on Sunday had been a long time in building. But even as armed mobs were breaking police lines, storming government buildings, and brandishing the red hammer-and-sickle, news of what was happening spread slowly.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin kept up pressure on his opponents in Russia's regions and territories today by ordering regional councils to submit to new elections and face a drastic reduction in their size.</p> <p>In his latest decree, Mr. Yeltsin gave a special commission six days to come up with a reorganization of regional government and set election procedures for new regional councils.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>With the vicious battle for supremacy between the executive and legislative branches resolved in fire and blood, Russian analysts and Western diplomats agree that a real revolution may now begin, bringing with it fundamental changes in the way Russia is governed.</p> <p>The most recent warfare between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Parliament was all about unfinished business from the failed putsch of August 1991. It sealed the end of the Soviet Union four months later, but it left the fundamentals of the political system almost unaltered. "The Second Russian Revolution," as it was called, was foreshortened and incomplete: the ruling class received a nasty shock, but remained in place.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a decree today to allow farm workers to own and dispose of land freely. Thus he lowered a major hurdle to reforming the Soviet system of large state or collective farms.</p> <p>The move has been widely debated in the press as a compromise between conservatives' efforts to prevent the parceling out of the state-controlled farms and progressives' demands for a totally free market in land.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Militant supporters of the Parliament, which has been banned by President Boris N. Yeltsin, clashed with riot police officers in the center of Moscow today while envoys of the warring sides bargained late into the night over conditions for ending their armed standoff at the Parliament building.</p> <p>Reports from the talks, held under the auspices of the Russian Orthodox Patriarch at his headquarters in the Danilov Monastery, were sketchy. But a senior Church official said an agreement calling for a mutual stand-down could be reached soon between representatives of Mr. Yeltsin and the Parliament.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Russia's main Communist Party, among the largest political parties in the country, was suspended today by the Justice Ministry under the state-of-emergency decrees of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>The ministry also suspended the People's Party of Free Russia, which had been led by the jailed Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, but which has disavowed him. That brings to 10 the number of political parties and organizations suspended, as well as some 13 newspapers. The state of emergency is scheduled to end on Sunday, but it could be extended.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'bombs and explosives', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia is threatening to veto new Security Council sanctions against Libya for refusing to surrender two suspects in the bombing of a Pan American World Airlines airliner over Scotland five years ago unless the United States, Britain and France give it an interest-free loan to cover a $4 billion debt Tripoli owes it.</p> <p>The United States and its allies are resisting the Russian demand, which one American diplomat described as "a nonstarter."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Senate passed a foreign-aid bill tonight that includes $2.5 billion for Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The vote was 87-13. President Clinton signed the bill just hours later.</p> <p>The $13 billion bill was approved by the House on Wednesday when lawmakers speeded the process to show support for President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with Parliament.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Representatives of Russia's warring President and Parliament agreed early today to a phased lifting of the armed confrontation at the headquarters of the legislature, the Interfax news agency reported.</p> <p>Interfax said both sides, meeting also with Mayor Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, signed an agreement at 2:40 A.M. under which electricity, heat and some telephones would be immediately restored to the headquarters, known as the White House, and arms held by the defenders of the building would be put in storage.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>After twice canceling trips to Japan, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia arrived here Monday night, as Japanese officials did everything they could to damp expectations of any progress on the territorial dispute that has soured relations between the two countries for nearly half a century.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin held a ceremonial meeting this morning with Emperor Akihito. He will also hold talks with the new Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, and is seeking more financial aid and investment from Japan, which has already supplied nearly $5 billion under a strategy that calls for a "balanced equilibrium" in the improvement of relations.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Like many deputies in the regional legislature, Oleg F. Anishchik was outraged by President Boris N. Yeltsin's order on Sept. 21 to suspend the national Parliament. The 49-year-old chairman of the regional legislature joined his fellow legislators in condemning the order as a violation of the Constitution.</p> <p>But now, after Mr. Yeltsin has smashed his parliamentary opposition in a hail of gunfire, it is Mr. Anishchik who is under political siege.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After an urgent appeal for help from Georgia's embattled leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Russian officials said today that they were considering joint action with other countries in the Caucasus region to protect Georgia's main supply route from rebel attacks.</p> <p>But Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev ruled out any direct Russian military intervention in Georgia, where Mr. Shevardnadze is caught in a desperate fight for survival against a rebellion led by his archrival, former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Two senior Rusian military officers were assassinated in Algeria Saturday, officials announced today, apparently as part of a new phase of a two-year-old terror campaign by Muslim fundamentalists.</p> <p>The movement that is trying to press the Algerian Government into giving up power has indicated recently that it will try to drive foreign specialists and diplomats out of the country.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government imposed a permanent ban today on 13 newspapers and a television show known for friendly treatment of his former opposition in the disbanded Russian Parliament, but said it would allow two nationally circulated dailies to reopen under new names.</p> <p>Pravda, for more than 70 years the flagship organ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Sovetskaya Rossiya, a bastion of Russian ultranationalist views, were told they could register under new names and resume publication if they dismissed their editors.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>American officials expressed hope today that the defeat of President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents in Moscow had swept aside the vestiges of the old Soviet system. But they said they remained unsure that the opening would make way for true democracy.</p> <p>With their vision of a democratic Russia still embodied almost solely in Mr. Yeltsin, the officials said they recognized that the path toward democratization remained littered with obstacles within Russian society and perhaps presented by the Russian President himself.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>With the Parliament building still smoldering and ringed with armor, President Boris N. Yeltsin moved today to concentrate power in his office and to shatter any possible opposition.</p> <p>Two weeks after he first opened his all-out campaign against what he called his "irreconcilable opposition," Mr. Yeltsin and his lieutenants seemed determined not to repeat what they perceived as their major faults in the past two years -- their failure to cash in on political triumphs and their agreeing to illusory compromises with the opposition.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'biographical information']	<p>Among those who died Sunday in the firefight at the Russian radio and television station was an American lawyer who spent his last hour trying to save others.</p> <p>Witnesses said Terry Michael Duncan, 26 years old, repeatedly went to the front of the building that was under assault, pulling as many people as he could to safety.</p>
['news and news media', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Flags flew at half-staff across Moscow today, even from atop the charred Parliament building, as Russia observed a national day of mourning and families held funerals for those who died in the violence that engulfed the capital on Sunday and Monday.</p> <p>"Russia, its people and its leaders, must learn a solemn lesson from the bloodshed and do everything in their power so that the tragedy cannot happen again," President Boris N. Yeltsin said in a statement.</p>
['news and news media', 'elections']	<p>There is an instinctive autocrat in Boris Yeltsin. When the bloody showdown with his parliamentary opponents came, one of his first moves was to close down Pravda and other opposition papers and impose censorship on the rest of the press.</p> <p>The old Soviet system of silence was recreated with worrying ease. Bureaucrats appeared at each newspaper, announced that they were censors and demanded office space. Vladimir Solodin, who had had the job of defending freedom of the press in the Yeltsin Government, switched to be chief of censorship without a visible qualm.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia has a computerized system that can automatically fire its nuclear arsenal in wartime if military commanders are dead or unable to direct the battle, a leading American expert on the Russian military says.</p> <p>The Russians call it the "dead hand," according to the expert, who personally characterizes it as a doomsday machine. If the system in fact exists -- and some American intelligence analysts say it is unlikely but possible -- it would mark the first known time in the nuclear era that a machine has been readied to press the button.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia delayed Security Council action today against President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia by objecting to efforts intended to encourage him to press separatist Serbs in Croatia to resolve their conflict with the Government in Zagreb.</p> <p>Because of Mosow's objections, the Council was unable for the second day in a row to agree on renewing the mandate for the 22,000 United Nations peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia for another six months. Instead, the Council renewed the mandate for four days, until Tuesday, to allow more time for negotiations. This action came after the Council extended the peacekeeping mission for 24 hours on Thursday.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, apparently under pressure from his armed forces, has sent a letter to President Clinton opposing any expansion of NATO to include East European nations like Poland or the Czech Republic, Western diplomats said today.</p> <p>Sent after President Yeltsin dissolved Parliament on Sept. 21 and embarked on a collision course with members opposed to his reforms, the letter amounts to sharp retreat from the position the Russian leader outlined during a visit to Warsaw in August. At the time he expressed understanding of Poland's desire to join NATO and said it did not threaten Russian interests.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>An early-morning agreement to disarm the irregular defenders of the besieged Russian Parliament collapsed after a few hours today when hard-core legislators disowned their negotiators and threw out the pact.</p> <p>The agreement, reached at 2:40 A.M., was the first break in the tense standoff, promising at least to lift the threat of a lethal clash between heavily armed defenders inside the Parliament building, called the White House, and a huge ring of security forces outside.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>If President Boris N. Yeltsin does go ahead on Monday with his twice-postponed visit to Tokyo, which he has vowed to do, there are serious questions about what he's going to be able to accomplish there -- and what might happen in Russia while he's away.</p> <p>It was quiet today in Moscow, with the population still shellshocked by the violent confrontation between Mr. Yeltsin and his parliamentary rivals. The city remains under a curfew and state of emergency decrees that ban all political demonstrations.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>As Russia's fate hung in the balance one week ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government seemed almost paralyzed.</p> <p>While bands of Communist and nationalist gunmen broke through to the Parliament building, the headquarters of President Yeltsin's foes, and battled for the state television center, the large force of special police around the building disintegrated, presidential aides were in disarray, the President dallied at his dacha and soldiers from elite units were out picking potatoes.</p>
['elections']	<p>President Clinton will meet Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in Moscow in mid-January as part of the Administration's campaign to support Mr. Yeltsin's struggle to transform his country into a free-market democracy.</p> <p>The trip, announced today by Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a joint news conference here with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, is also evidently intended to enhance Mr. Clinton's standing as a statesman and divert the spotlight from the Administration's foreign policy setbacks in Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. The Administration would clearly like to focus attention on its support for democratization in Russia, the foreign policy area where the Clinton Administration feels it has been most successful. Separate Trip for Gore</p> <p>It was also announced in Washington that Vice President Al Gore will make a separate trip to Moscow, three days after the Russian parliamentary elections, scheduled for Dec. 12.</p>
['elections', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As part of its campaign to support President Boris N. Yeltsin in his efforts to change Russia, the United States offered technical help today to try to insure that parliamentary elections in December are free and fair.</p> <p>"Our efforts -- if we are asked -- would focus on the nuts and bolts of free elections, from voter education to poll-watching," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in a speech to the Academy of the National Economy.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin came here today for his first public appearance since the violent showdown in Moscow with his hard-line opponents three weeks ago, but was kept from a mostly friendly crowd by hundreds of police officers and army guards.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin came to this city about 125 miles northeast of Moscow to dedicate a statue of the 11th-century Prince of Kiev, Yaroslav the Wise, who ruled over Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and created the first written Slavic legal code.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'news and news media', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Continuing to change the Russian political system by fiat, President Boris N. Yeltsin today ordered a popular referendum on Dec. 12 on whether to accept a new constitution that is not yet finished and that voters have not yet seen.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin decreed that when Russians vote for a new, two-chamber legislature that day, they will also find a single referendum question on the ballot: "Do you agree to the constitution of the Russian Federation? Yes or no."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After winning strong backing from the United States and its major allies in his successful showdown with the Russian Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin today abruptly dropped his opposition to an American-backed plan to put more pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to end the civil war in Croatia.</p> <p>As a result, the Security Council voted unanimously today to extend for six more months the mandate for the 22,000 United Nations peacekeeping forces deployed in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia. But the Council said it was unlikely to relax the trade embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the remaining republics in the Yugoslav Federation, until they persuade Croatia's ethnic Serbs to make peace with the Croatian Government in Zagreb.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Across Russia, all eyes were on the confrontation in Moscow today. A sampling of reports tonight from some of the 88 regions that make up the Russian federation indicated that the violence had not spread beyond the capital.</p> <p>"Everyone has been watching television and listening to the radio all day just to understand what is happening in Moscow," said Stanislav E. Bogomolov, the editor on the news desk at Uralsky Rabochi, a newspaper in Yekaterinburg, an industrial city in the Ural Mountains that is also President Boris N. Yeltsin's hometown. "It is absolutely calm here."</p>
['religion and churches', 'reform and reorganization', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Now begins the arduous task of reconciling the Russian nation and building a democratic state on the rubble of Communism. The prospects for success look better than at any time since the abdication of Czar Nicholas II in March 1917.</p> <p>Unless President Boris Yeltsin repeats previous mistakes and seeks compromises with his defeated enemies, who interpret readiness to compromise as weakness, we are unlikely ever again to see a resurgence of a militant antidemocratic opposition. The events of the past two days are probably the last outbreak of violent counterrevolution in Russia.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>The Clinton Administration reiterated its support today for President Boris N. Yeltsin but urged him to use free elections to mend the bitter divisions in Russia now that he has crushed the parliamentary rebellion that challenged his reforms.</p> <p>President Clinton defended as both legitimate and necessary the attack that swept anti-Yeltsin opponents from their base inside the Russian Parliament building. Mr. Clinton said the Russian leader had "no other alternative but to try and restore order."</p>
['television', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Drawn by a mix of horror and fascination, thousands of Muscovites turned out on the southern bank of the Moscow River today to watch as their White House -- once a symbol of Russian democracy -- turned black with smoke.</p> <p>Young men climbed trees and young girls sat on their boyfriends' shoulders to get a better view. Old women out walking their dogs made a detour to peer over the shoulders of a crowd that had grown six deep. Soldiers had the best vantage point of all, sitting atop T-80 tanks that had their guns pointed directly at the White House, as the Parliament building is known.</p>
['news and news media', 'television', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Tanks and troops loyal to President Boris N. Yeltsin today crushed an armed uprising by his opponents with a potent show of force that left their white riverside stronghold battered and in flames.</p> <p>The Parliament building, known as the White House, was shaken by huge explosions from 125-millimeter shells fired from T-72 and T-80 tanks. As crack airborne troops conducted a floor-by-floor assault, hundreds of legislators, defenders and supporters began filing out of the building shortly before 5 P.M. Their leaders followed at 6 P.M. (11 A.M., Eastern time).</p>
['television', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>It was like a television remake of the Russian Revolution: crowds under the red hammer and sickle driving the outnumbered police and militiamen before them, storming Government buildings, becoming masters of the streets. Or at least some streets and some buildings, at least for a while. They were even chanting "All power to the Soviets!"</p> <p>CNN was there, of course, as it was so dramatically in the Persian Gulf war and the landing in Somalia. This time scenes of conflict were shown before a bright backdrop of autumn colors. Steve Hurst, CNN Moscow correspondent, was on the job from the first morning signs of confrontation into the night, calling what he was watching from the the network's studio in the mayor's office "total confusion."</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>The assault on the Russian Parliament building today was a textbook example of the decisive application of military power. But for all the firepower -- and the fires burning inside tonight showed that there was plenty -- the attack was punctuated by long lulls as the Russian military waited to see if the rebels would yield.</p> <p>Strobe Talbott, the American Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet republics, said President Boris N. Yeltsin's aides had indicated that they considered two basic tactics: an all-out attack or a gradual operation that would give the anti-Yeltsin forces an opportunity to surrender.</p>
['public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The defeated leaders of the armed uprising against President Boris N. Yeltsin may not have had a broad popular base. But the criticism leveled by these men, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, against Mr. Yeltsin, his policies and his embrace of one-man rule has resonated with a broad swath of Russians who regard themselves as centrists.</p> <p>This broad center reacted with disgust to the motley collection of Communists, ultranationalists, fascists, bully boys and anti-Semites who clustered around the Parliament's cause. But while most Russians are surely relieved to have order restored, they did not stir themselves to rally for Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>The day that Boris Yeltsin climbed up on that tank a couple of years ago, the West cheered for joy, and made a great human and political error. It is embarrassing to think about now, it was so intellectually and politically callous, so we don't.</p> <p>For all their lives, the people imprisoned under Soviet Communism never read a free newspaper, voted in a free election, made a single free speech, or heard one. They lived in a state whose captives knew that it was dangerous even to think.</p>
['foreign aid', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>European leaders rushed to express support for Boris N. Yeltsin today even after it became clear that there had been heavy bloodshed as military forces loyal to the Russian President attacked his opponents in the Parliament building.</p> <p>Foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community, meeting in Luxembourg, blamed "elements hostile to the democratization process" for the violence in Moscow and expressed support for Mr. Yeltsin and "the process of reform."</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed today that the Russian military doctrine adopted on Tuesday abandoned the old Soviet pledge not to use nuclear weapons first.</p> <p>Gen. Pavel S. Grachev said at a news conference at the Defense Ministry that the doctrine ruled out the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states that had signed the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, unless they were allied with a nuclear-armed country.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'accidents and safety', 'economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'bombs and explosives', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States, Britain and France have warned President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia that relations between their countries will suffer if Moscow continues to block plans for new sanctions against Libya over its refusal to extradite two men accused in the bombing of a Pan American World Airways jet over Scotland five years ago.</p> <p>President Clinton and Prime Ministers John Major of Britain and Edouard Balladur of France sent separate messages to Mr. Yeltsin this week conveying this warning and saying that public opinion in their countries demands additional measures against Libya over the Pan Am bombing, in which 271 people were killed, diplomats here say.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin approved the draft of the first post-Soviet constitution today. If approved by voters on Dec. 12, the constitution will give Russia a strong executive presidency and restrict the powers of its constituent regions.</p> <p>The final draft is to be published Tuesday. An earlier draft, which has only been slightly changed, confirmed that a new two-chamber parliament that is also to be elected on Dec. 12 will serve only two years, while Mr. Yeltsin will serve out the rest of his five-year term, until June 1996.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's Security Council approved new guiding principles today for the Russian Army in a long-awaited "military doctrine," which declares that the main source of military danger is no longer any nation or alliance, but small local conflicts.</p> <p>The 24-page document was not immediately published, but much of it has already been publicly discussed, and the Interfax news agency offered additional details supplied by Valery Manilov, the Security Council official who prepared the final draft.</p>
['public opinion', 'biographical information']	<p>If he did sense an unquenchable desire to return to active politics, Mikhail S. Gorbachev insists, "I would find a way."</p> <p>What that way might be is hard to figure, given his consistently dismal rankings in Russian public-opinion polls. But at 62, he is still radiating energy and boundless self-confidence, still riveted by the profound process of change that he kicked off in 1985.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>An unusual coalition of Russian military experts and conservative former Pentagon officials is urging Moscow and Washington to take most of their nuclear missiles off alert.</p> <p>The proposal is part of a broad package of measures to reduce the threat of nuclear miscalculation. It also comes as Defense Secretary Les Aspin has started a broad review of United States nuclear forces and strategy.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin went on national television tonight to open his campaign for a new constitution that he promised would help restore "law and order" to a country that has seen little of either in the last two years.</p> <p>"We need order, but not the horrible repressive order of the Stalinist camps," Mr. Yeltsin said. "Russia needs a steady, law-based order badly," he added, not an "iron hand" but a "democratic state that will insure progress toward a normal and worthy life for citizens, toward prosperity for a single, integral Russia."</p>
['treaties']	<p>Russia and China signed a five-year military cooperation agreement today that is expected to broaden the transfer of military technology to China. But the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel Grachev, said the expanded cooperation would not be used "against any third country."</p> <p>Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized that General Grachev was not here to negotiate any new sale of Russian weapons to China, which has been a matter of concern to China's neighbors and to the United States.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Russia has reacted angrily to Ukraine's partial and highly conditional ratification of a major nuclear-arms treaty, saying Ukraine's decision to retain 58 percent of its 1,650 warheads could destabilize "the entire system of international relations, especially in Europe."</p> <p>The decision, made by Ukraine's Parliament on Thursday, was also a severe embarrassment to the Clinton Administration, which has thus far failed to persuade the Ukrainians to abide by their President's commitment to become a non-nuclear state.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Backing off a promise to hold an early presidential election next June, President Boris N. Yeltsin told a group of Russian newspaper editors today that he wanted to stay in office until his term expires in 1996.</p> <p>The President's statement -- which seems to have taken some close advisers by surprise -- promptly drew fire from some of his chief opponents, who accused him of playing "tricks" with the electorate just as a campaign for Russia's new two-chamber Parliament is getting getting under way.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic energy']	<p>Capping a series of actions hailed by environmentalists as a turning point in the protection of the world's oceans, the United States and 36 other governments voted yesterday to impose a permanent, legally binding ban on the dumping of all types of radioactive waste at sea.</p> <p>The vote to ban dumping of low-level radioactive wastes came at a meeting in London of 42 of the 71 nations that signed a 1972 treaty on ocean dumping. Five of the countries represented at the meeting -- Russia, Britain, France, China and Belgium -- abstained from the vote.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Campaigning for Russia's parliamentary elections began today after 13 political groups received permission to put up candidates.</p> <p>The 13 groups include 5 groups backing President Boris N. Yeltsin as well as the Russian Communist Party, the centrist Civic Union and the rightist Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>It's official: the cold war is over.</p> <p>Without hoopla, Congress passed the Friendship Act before it adjourned last week. Acknowledging that the arch-enemy that Ronald Reagan once called the Evil Empire has vanished, the act repeals laws that even suggest an adversarial relationship between the United States and the former Soviet Union.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'reform and reorganization', 'finances', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Here on the Russian steppes 650 miles southeast of Moscow, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Sidyakin is trying to teach his men a new military lesson.</p> <p>For four decades, the 27th Division was stationed in East Germany as part of the Group Soviet Forces Germany, the cream of the Russian Army, standing eyeball-to-eyeball with the Americans.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'energy and power']	<p>This is the coldest autumn here in 50 years, and Ukrainians are beginning to feel it indoors as well as out. Throughout the country, apartments and offices are getting colder, hot water is running out and brownouts are more common.</p> <p>Temperatures have already dipped to 8 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and even the Parliament building is freezing inside. At many factories, like Gostomel Glass Works outside Kiev, workers on the assembly lines dress in thick parkas, fur hats and gloves.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>President Clinton issued a stern warning today to North Korea not to develop a nuclear weapon as it continues to block international inspections of its nuclear sites.</p> <p>"North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb," Mr. Clinton said in an interview on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." "We have to be very firm about it."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Most of the Russian Army may be reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the blow to its professional pride, but it is boom time for Russia's 201st Motorized Rifle Division, stationed abroad in nominally independent Tajikistan.</p> <p>The 201st, as a rear-echelon force in what was the Soviet Union's poorest republic, had been under strength for years by as much as 40 percent.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>In her cramped apartment outside the gates of the Russian military base on the outskirts of the Latvian capital, Lyubov Umanskaya is packed up and waiting to go.</p> <p>"It is like living in a railway station," said the 38-year-old wife of a Russian major, sitting among the boxes and shipping crates that have filled the living room in her small three-room apartment for the better part of a year.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher redefined priorities for America's foreign policy today, but restoring democracy to Haiti, ending the war in Bosnia and reconciling warring parties in Somalia were not on his list.</p> <p>In his first formal appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since May, Mr. Christopher sought to divert attention from the Administration's performance in those three countries, dismissing them as "difficult situations" where "things have not gone exactly as we had planned."</p>
['elections']	<p>Evidently acknowledging criticism questioning his commitment to democracy, President Boris N. Yeltsin has denied that he has ruled out a presidential race in June.</p> <p>In an interview published in Izvestia today, Mr. Yeltsin said he did not relish the idea of early elections because he is serving a five-year term that ends in June 1996 and already received a vote of support in an April referendum. But he acknowledged that he promised a fresh presidential vote during his struggle with the federal Parliament, which he suspended on Sept. 21 and finally shelled into oblivion on Oct. 4.</p> <p>"I hope you have not forgotten my decree calling early presidential elections on June 12, 1994," Mr. Yeltsin said. "It is effective unless I cancel it."</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>As light snow began to fall from a frozen gray sky on Tishinsky Square, Nadezhda S. Timoshenko pulled her woolen scarf tight and spread out three things on the ground before her: a glass lampshade, a crystal goblet and the lid of a plain porcelain sugar bowl.</p> <p>"I have to sell my things to survive," she said. Her monthly retirement pension is the equivalent of $25, not enough to live on with prices soaring.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Campaign workers sit clustered under the whimsical domes of St. Basil's with hand-lettered signs reading Russia's Choice, Movement for Democratic Reform and New Russia. They try to shield their clipboards from the wet snow and patiently explain to a steady stream of people how to fill out petition forms.</p> <p>"These are the people I trust to build democracy," explains Ivan Mukhanov, a teacher.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States warned Libya today that it may face a global boycott of its oil if it does not hand over suspected terrorists. The warning came after Russia, under Western pressure, dropped its objections to a new set of Security Council sanctions against the North African oil-producing country.</p> <p>American officials said the Administration would press for a total oil boycott if the new limited trade and financial embargo just worked out between the United States, Britain, France and Russia does not prompt Libya to surrender the two suspects indicted in the bombing of Pan American World Airlines Flight 103, which exploded over Scotland five years ago with the loss of 270 lives.</p>
['television', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>From slick ads splicing pop stars and small children with pictures of a smiling President Boris N. Yeltsin, to a mini-documentary accusing the Government of robbery and incipient Stalinism, Russians are getting their first taste of the rough campaigning that will dominate the airwaves each night until the eve of parliamentary elections on Dec. 12.</p> <p>The campaign kicked off formally on Nov. 8, but for most voters it began Monday evening with chunks of free air time distributed to each political party on two state-owned television channels.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>The referendum and elections worked out as I had planned: I, Boris Yeltsin, am now the most powerful Kremlin leader since Yuri Andropov, and -- at the same time -- I am the only hope of the Western world.</p> <p>Not an easy combination to bring about. First I had to show my democratic reformers -- mostly intellectuals who think me a brave simpleton -- how dependent on me they are.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'television', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Elections are said to be the best school for democracy. But if Russia eventually graduates as a full-fledged democracy, few people will look back at this first multiparty campaign, which ends with voting on Sunday, with much pride or nostalgia.</p> <p>Daubed in the blood of October's violent confrontation between President Boris N. Yeltsin and the holdover Parliament, these elections have been tossed together so quickly, with so much improvisation about the rules and so little knowledge about the candidates, that they are unlikely to provide the legitimacy for a new political system that Mr. Yeltsin, and the West, would like.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Officially, the Russian Ambassador to the United States is on vacation.</p> <p>But it is hardly a secret that the Ambassador, Vladimir P. Lukin, is really on the hustings back in Moscow, campaigning for a seat in Parliament as part of a bloc that poses a challenge to President Boris N. Yeltsin. At the ornate Russian Embassy, which was the setting for so much cold war skulduggery and scheming, his rebellious campaign has set a new standard in intrigue.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Over the objections of the United States, Russian cargo planes flew special truck chassis that are commonly used for mobile missile launchers from North Korea to Syria last summer, Clinton Administration officials say.</p> <p>Aides familiar with classified intelligence reports said two large Russian Condor planes had flown the vehicles in August from Sunan airfield in North Korea to Damascus. American intelligence officials said the vehicles had probably been taken from there to a missile plant at Nasariya for use in Syria's Scud missile program.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Suffering from layoffs and wages that have not kept pace with inflation, the voters of this industrial and agricultural center in southern Russia appear to be favoring candidates in the parliamentary election on Sunday who advocate a much slower transformation to a market economy.</p> <p>Most of the candidates have publicly distanced themselves from President Boris N. Yeltsin's policies, which have cut off or cut back credits to industry with the goal of forcing them to become more efficient or go out of business. Even Mayor Yuri V. Chekov, who is running for Parliament, declares himself an independent, although he is endorsed by Russia's Choice, the party allied with Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In what may be a sign of a weakening of economic resolve after his electoral rebuff on Sunday, President Boris N. Yeltsin today granted new heavily subsidized loans that could aggravate the budget deficit and inflation.</p> <p>At the same time, after an extended debate, Mr. Yeltsin's Government approved the draft of a weaker, less centralized privatization program over objections from well-known reformers, including First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and Privatization Minister Anatoly B. Chubais.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>In an election where most candidates are worried about voter indifference, Anatoly V. Guskov, a 45-year-old millionaire businessman running for a seat in Russia's new Parliament, knows how to draw a crowd.</p> <p>When Mr. Guskov arrived in this small town on Moscow's southeastern rim for a meeting with pensioners last week, the 650-seat hall was so full that extra benches had to be brought in to accommodate several dozen angry women who had been locked outside in the freezing cold, beating on the doors to get in.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>While Russia continued its painfully slow counting of votes from Sunday's election, its biggest vote-getter, the acerbic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, offered today to play a responsible part in any new government.</p> <p>Appearing at a news conference in a black tuxedo, Mr. Zhirinovsky, who appears to have won nearly a quarter of the vote from a population angry with the price of change, was by turns reasonable and bombastic, promising to do nothing to destabilize the Government while he waits for a presidential election to be called. Willing to Wait</p> <p>Even if President Boris N. Yeltsin completes his five-year term in June 1996, Mr. Zhirinovsky said, "then my election to that post would be a nice present for my 50th birthday."</p>
['elections']	<p>In the end, the most damning consequence of the Russian vote may not be anything Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky does, but the shattering of Russia's tenuous image here and abroad as an apprentice democracy, virtually a full partner with Western nations.</p> <p>Before the final count was in, before there was any concrete idea what the distribution of forces would be in the new Parliament, there were horrified reactions to Mr. Zhirinovsky's xenophobic Great Russian sentiments, which include calling for the restoration of the former Soviet Union and Soviet bloc.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Despite their confident public comments, President Clinton and senior officials in his Administration were "startled and shaken," one of them conceded today, by the results of Sunday's parliamentary voting in Russia.</p> <p>Several said that while it was not clear precisely how American policy would change toward Russia, the other former states of the Soviet Union and the former Soviet satellites, it was clear that the policy would have to be rethought. At a minimum, several officials said, Mr. Clinton will have to find some way to ease the exclusive identification of American policy in the region with the success of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>The party behind Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky boasts a dues-paying membership of 100,000. But besides Mr. Zhirinovsky, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has little to offer.</p> <p>Mr. Zhirinovsky's face is on all the party's posters, on the front of every issue of its newspapers -- "Liberal," "Zhirinovsky's Truth" and "Zhirinovsky's Falcon" -- and on the cover of its campaign literature.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The strong showing by staunch nationalists in Russia's parliamentary elections has thrown a new element of uncertainty into the preparations for next month's NATO summit meeting in Brussels.</p> <p>At the meeting, scheduled for Jan. 10-11, the leaders of the Atlantic alliance are expected to approve an American proposal to offer increased political and military cooperation between NATO and former members of the Warsaw Pact on a basis that would put Russia on the same footing as Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'energy and power', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>After a series of crises ranging from a civil war to the worst drought in 50 years, this small country on the southwestern edge of Russia has pushed its nationalist leaders aside, and the Government is trying to reform the economy.</p> <p>But severe energy shortages and still troubled relations with Moscow, this former Soviet republic's main oil supplier, threaten the market-oriented Government's plans as winter sets in and February elections approach.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>After the strong vote for the far right and far left, President Boris N. Yeltsin had a serious choice to make about the pace and kind of economic reform. But today, in his first post-election news conference, there was no indication he has made that choice.</p> <p>His decision to keep Yegor T. Gaidar, a current First Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the reformers, means the probable continuation of a Government so divided that it has been unable to pursue a consistent economic strategy.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>In his first major assessment of Russia's parliamentary elections, President Boris N. Yeltsin today described the vote as a major reprimand. He said that he would keep his current economic team and its reform program but that his Government would give more attention to the problems of the poor and introduce a "new, more open style."</p> <p>At a Kremlin news conference, Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged the successes of those who had used "primitive nationalism, outright lies and even dangerous provocations," but he avoided direct criticism of the person he saw as the major beneficiary of those tactics, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian nationalist politician whose ties with German right-wing extremist groups have led newspapers here to call him "the Russian Hitler," spent the day with a former SS volunteer in Austria today and canceled an interview on German television.</p> <p>He stirred up controversy in Germany all the same.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>The campaign to choose a new parliament and a new constitution for Russia is drawing to a close on a far more somber note than many pro-reform politicians had predicted.</p> <p>Two months ago, as the last of the old People's Deputies was being marched out of the smoldering White House, many euphoric "democrats" expected that Russia would finally acquire a legislature and charter dedicated to the transformation of the nation.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>A picture of those Russians who voted for the ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in parliamentary elections two weeks ago is beginning to emerge from an analysis of polling data that suggest his electorate will not be stable.</p> <p>The vote for Mr. Zhirinovsky, an ardent rightist whose oddly named Liberal Democratic Party secured the highest percentage of the party-preference votes on Dec. 12, has been interpreted as a vote against economic reform, a vote against crime and instability, a vote for empire, a vote for Russian racial primacy.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>For the paratroops of the 39th Air Assault Brigade, the hilltop compound here would have been the jump-off point for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. Now it belongs to Ukraine, which is trying to shape remnants of the Soviet Army into a force it can truly call its own.</p> <p>Col. Mykhailo Koval, the commander of the base, wears the blue beret of Ukrainian air mobile troops. But the colonel concedes that this new army remains to be taught "that it is honorable to defend a Ukrainian motherland."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Two old women walked past, bent by age and thickly bundled in worn quilted cotton and huge felt boots, but moving surprisingly fast through the carpet of new snow.</p> <p>"So babushka, 'everyone to the elections,' right?" said a passer-by, invoking the old Soviet slogan that used to insure turnouts of 99 percent and better for an unopposed Communist slate.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>It's been two weeks since Pravda disappeared from print, this time for failing to pay its bills, but even declared Communists are not bemoaning its absence too loudly.</p> <p>True, the venerable daily founded by Lenin himself in 1912 was probably the only major Russian newspaper to openly support the Communist Party in the campaign for a new Parliament, but then there was never any doubt how its readers would vote, anyway.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>As a candidate, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky has portrayed himself as a dyed-in-the-wool Russian, and he has made anti-Semitic remarks.</p> <p>But Moscow Jews remember him as a man who regarded himself as a Jew several years ago, and who for a while served as an active director of a Jewish cultural organization formed in 1989.</p> <p>They said he identified his father, Volf Zhirinovsky, as a Jew, and his mother as a Russian. The father died in an auto accident soon after Mr. Zhirinovsky was born, after only a year of marriage to his mother.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>President Clinton today played down the importance of the unexpectedly strong showing of anti-reformers in the Russian elections and said there was no need to change Washington's policy toward Moscow.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton expressed concern about statements made by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, an ultranationalist and the biggest winner in the election Sunday, and said Washington's support for President Boris N. Yeltsin and the reformers would continue.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the racist demagogue whose party took a surprisingly big chunk of the vote in the new Russian parliament, an incipient Adolf Hitler? No. Is Russia, in the painful throes of transition to capitalism, another Weimar Germany? No. Are we pumping up this man's support by insulting voters who used him as their vehicle of protest? Yes.</p> <p>He won a Perot-sized slice of the ballots by organizing a party first; by outspending his dozen rivals on television in the final two weeks; by staying on his message of resentment of corruption, crime, unemployment and loss of national pride; by inheriting the support of fringe parties foolishly banned by a remote Boris Yeltsin; and by running against an establishment slate that took its pompous campaign style from Thomas E. Dewey.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>The initial wave of anxiety over Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's strong showing in Sunday's election abated today as tallies of candidates elected from single-member districts reportedly showed that reformers would still form the largest single bloc in the new Parliament.</p> <p>"The Liberal Democratic Party is celebrating victory prematurely," a senior aide to President Boris N. Yeltsin, Nikolai Medvedev, was quoted by Interfax as saying about the ultranationalist party of Mr. Zhirinovsky, which won a stunning 24 percent in the party-preference voting for the new Parliament. The party-preference vote is used to apportion half of the 450 seats in Parliament; the other half are filled in the district elections.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>To discover something of the Zhirinovsky phenomenon, one need look no farther than two cold, filthy men, one old and one young, shoveling wet concrete today outside the Moskvich car factory.</p> <p>Both of them voted for Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the 47-year-old right-wing nationalist whose showing in Russia's parliamentary elections has sent a shiver through the Russian Government and most of the world. The pro-Government Russia's Choice party, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, ran a poor second to Mr. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party in the party-preference section of Sunday's balloting.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>If his party had not won almost a quarter of the vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday, Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky could well be dismissed as a crude parody of a primitive right-winger, fired by self-pity and primitive nationalism, quick to blame foreigners, intellectuals or unappreciative betters for all his failures, certain of his cause.</p> <p>His posters show the 47-year-old lawyer wearing a badly knotted tie and a puffy scowl over slogans like, "I'll raise Russia from her knees," or "I'll not allow anyone to offend Russians."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The stunning success of an ultranationalist populist, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, in Russia's first multiparty elections does not mean he will dominate the new Parliament. But it will give him a credible platform to seek support for himself and his political party in preparation for the next presidential election, which is scheduled for June 1996.</p> <p>The Liberal Democratic Party, which Mr. Zhirinovsky leads, appears to have won the most votes, up to 25 percent of the total. But only half of the 450 seats in the Duma, the lower house, are to be filled according to expressions of party preference. The other half, and the entire Federation Council, or upper house, is to be filled by candidates running in individual districts, and there are many fewer Zhirinovsky supporters among them.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Clinton today welcomed the outcome of Russia's first parliamentary elections, saying that despite the strong showing by nationalist parties, the new Constitution and Parliament had swept away the last remnants of the Soviet system and had laid a foundation for democracy.</p> <p>In a brief chat with reporters after an economic conference at Bryn Mawr College, Mr. Clinton sought to put the best face on the Russian vote. While noting that not all the ballots had been tallied, Mr. Clinton did say that the strong showing of the fervently nationalist Liberal Democratic Party in the early returns should serve as a reminder to the West about how difficult the transition to democracy was for Russian working people.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Stunned by still-partial results that show them trailing far behind ultranationalists in Sunday's parliamentary elections, leaders of Russia's main Government party called on all pro-reform forces today to join forces urgently against the rising threat of "radical extremists."</p> <p>First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar admitted that his party, Russia's Choice, had received a "big and unpleasant surprise" after incomplete returns put the Liberal Democratic Party, led by the hard-line nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, ahead with the support of almost a quarter of the voters.  10-Point Lead for Nationalists</p> <p>Based on unofficial returns from 53 of Russia's 89 regions, the news agency Interfax tonight reported that Mr. Zhirinovsky's party had 24.5 percent of the vote and that Russia's Choice was far behind with 14.5 percent, closely followed by the Communist Party with 11.3 percent. Only five other parties were reported to be clearing the 5 percent threshold required to seat delegates in the new Federal Assembly. They included the Women's Party of Russia with 8.4 percent, and the reform party led by the economist Grigory A.  Yavlinsky with 6.7 percent.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'television', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>He is one of Russia's most caustic political figures, with a virulent antipathy toward the market-economy reforms that have taken root in St. Petersburg and much of the rest of Russia.</p> <p>He rose to fame with his television program, "600 Seconds," which began in 1987 with expose-like reports on the disasters of Communism and then turned to the uglier aspects of economic change in Russia.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>The bad boy of Russian politics, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a nationalist who thrives on shock value, turned on the charm tonight with a televised appeal to Russia's overworked and underappreciated women.</p> <p>"We men are mostly guilty before our women," the 47-year-old leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party said in a broadcast that began with his sister showing old photographs of their grandmother and their mother, and ended with the candidate offering his female viewers a symbolic gift of roses and candy.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Ukraine's President has told President Clinton that Kiev is prepared to deactivate its nuclear arsenal, including its entire force of modern SS-24 missiles, Clinton Administration officials said today.</p> <p>The assurance was conveyed last month by President Leonid Kravchuk in a telephone conversation with Mr. Clinton, the officials said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Sometime soon after the anti-Communist revolution, a new mantra entered international life.</p> <p>The phrases "free-market economy" and "democracy" became chanted together, an inseparable formula. Without one, the other could not exist. In combination they were sung as the only answer to the future of Eastern Europe and Russia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'social conditions and trends', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The Clinton Administration's top Russia specialist said today that the surprisingly large support for foes of reform in Russia's parliamentary elections last week showed that there had been too much emphasis on remaking the economy of Russia and not enough on improving the daily lives of its people.</p> <p>Strobe Talbott, the State Department's Ambassador at Large for Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, also said the United States was looking to other Russian reformers as well as President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring change to the troubled country, even if they were Mr. Yeltsin's political enemies. 'Shock Therapy' Has Failed</p> <p>While Mr. Talbott was characteristically cautious and noncommittal, his remarks illuminated an important shift in official American thinking: an admission, in effect, that the "shock therapy," the-faster-the-better approach to reform advocated by the West -- and until recently by Mr. Yeltsin -- has not worked.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'social conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>In another strong signal of a shift against economic reform after the Russian elections, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was quoted today as scathingly accusing Westernized reformers in his own Cabinet of "poorly thought-out experiments" and a failure "to think about the people, for the sake of whom the reforms were started."</p> <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin said the Government would now focus less on tight monetary and spending controls, which would reduce Russia's high rate of inflation, and more on social protection and on state and private investment to create jobs.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Vice President Al Gore appealed to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany today to put aside any doubts about Russia's political stability and to speed up aid to the country.</p> <p>In a nearly two hour meeting at Mr. Kohl's home, Mr. Gore also raised the question of whether the International Monetary Fund should ease the inflation quotas put on Russia so the country can get aid faster to relieve its severe social and economic troubles.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>"We're calling an audible." The Vice President's voice was like thin ice breaking.</p> <p>A half-hour before, Air Force Two aborted two passes at the short airstrip in befogged Almaty, Kazakhstan. With not enough fuel left for a third try, the pilot had put down in nearby Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, which did not expect the American visitor until the next day.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Initial returns from Russia's parliamentary elections on Sunday indicated an unexpectedly strong showing by zealous nationalists and Communists against disunited reformers, even while President Boris N. Yeltsin won approval for his new Constitution.</p> <p>The results stunned reform politicians who had gathered for a gala night in the Kremlin to celebrate the "Political New Year," and they lashed out at Mr. Yeltsin and their own disunity for the unexpected success of what they called "fascists and revanchists."</p>
['biographical information']	<p>The seal of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party displays an eagle hovering over the old Russian empire -- including Finland and Alaska.</p> <p>Mr. Zhirinovsky, a 47-year-old lawyer whose party is likely to be a major force in the new Parliament elected Sunday, calls himself "a moderate in all things," except for Russian statehood.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>There should have been a party on Sunday night at Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's headquarters on the top floor of a run-down pre-revolutionary building set deep in old Moscow.</p> <p>The maverick nationalist was surging ahead in the early election returns, pressing hard on the heels of Russia's Choice, the heavily favored party of the Government's economic reform team.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>In the rush of attention surrounding Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whose platform of empire and crime-busting attracted nearly a quarter of Russian voters on Sunday, there is considerable speculation about how soldiers cast their ballots.</p> <p>Given the unhappy state of the military and its crucial role in the last two attempted coups, most recently in October, the assumption has been that Mr. Zhirinovsky's call for harsh discipline and restoration of the Russian empire would bring him significant backing from soldiers and officers.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>A specter is haunting Europe the specter of extreme nationalism.</p> <p>When it appeared two years ago, in Serbia, the United States and Western Europe decided not to treat it as a serious threat. They followed a policy of appeasement, a wheedling diplomacy that rewarded Serbian aggression.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>For days phone calls have been coming in from Russian friends, explaining to me and themselves how in their homeland a fascist nationalist could have become a strong contender for power.</p> <p>In their explanations, and much of the American intellectual and political reaction, ran a theme of Western failure or guilt:</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>With neither reformers nor nationalists appearing to have a clear majority in the next Parliament, Russia is at a "dramatic crossroads" that only President Boris N. Yeltsin, with his new constitutional powers, can resolve, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar said today.</p> <p>Mr. Gaidar, leader of the main reform party, Russia's Choice, said he hoped Mr. Yeltsin would break his long silence on Sunday's elections and use his increased presidential powers of appointment, decree and veto to continue reform.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'space stations', 'treaties', 'energy and power', 'space']	<p>Insisting that they would not be deterred by political uncertainty, the United States and Russia formally joined as partners today on an international space station and announced that the first Russian astronaut would fly in the space shuttle Discovery in six weeks.</p> <p>While both sides had agreed to the basic space accord, the agreement today formally ended decades of rivalry between Moscow and Washington.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Nearly two years after Russia began its great economic experiment, freeing prices as it moved toward a market economy, industrial production seems to have stopped falling and the ruble has become relatively stable against the dollar.</p> <p>Together with the privatization of important parts of state industry, these are considerable achievements as the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin approaches a crucial parliamentary election and constitutional referendum on Dec. 12. They mean that most Russians still have jobs, that their salaries are worth more in dollars, and that there are goods in the shops to buy, though often at prices that make Russians blanch.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States offered today to mediate a range of thorny security disputes between Russia and Ukraine, including military protection for Ukraine, the dismantling of its nuclear arsenal and Russian compensation for Ukraine's highly enriched uranium, senior State Department officials said today.</p> <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the offer during a meeting with Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Anatoly Zlenko, as part of the Clinton Administration's strategy to nudge Ukraine into giving up its nuclear weapons by offering it political and economic incentives, the officials said.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>A synagogue in Moscow was destroyed by fire early this morning, fanning fears among some Jews that a new wave of anti-Semitic vandalism could be starting.</p> <p>"We don't know what happened," said Rabbi Berel Lazar, an Italian-born Lubavitcher who has been working since the fall of Communism to rebuild Russian Judaism. "Of course, there is reason for concern because of the political situation," he added, referring to the recent success of ultranationalists in Russia's parliamentary elections.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>When the Government was on the verge of being overthrown by insurrectionists loyal to an ousted President, the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, appealed to Russia for help. In exchange, he agreed to bring Georgia into the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian-dominated organization of former Soviet republics -- something Georgia had resolutely refused to do.</p> <p>Soon, Russian troops here came out of their barracks, and the marines landed at the port of Poti. Within less than a month the civil war was over, with Mr. Shevardnadze victorious.</p>
['elections']	<p>This is Russia's first modern political campaign, and here in freezing Tomsk, 1,800 miles from Moscow, Russians are discovering the political power of big business.</p> <p>This huge Siberian province, larger than Germany but with only a million people, is dominated by oil, timber and military industries, which in the past were largely inseparable from the Soviet Communist Party.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>The Clinton Administration has proposed updating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to accommodate a new anti-missile system designed to protect against third-world threats, Clinton Administration officials disclosed today.</p> <p>To underscore the significance the Administration attaches to the change, a White House official flew to Geneva early this week to propose the modification to Russian arms negotiators.</p>
['public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Russia's precipitate election campaign entered its home stretch today with blocs led by two old-time reform rivals leading the pack, but with a large clump of voters still undecided or altogether uninterested.</p> <p>Today was the last day that public-opinion polls could be published before the Dec. 12 election for a new Parliament, and they showed that Russia's Choice, led by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and tacitly backed by President Boris N. Yeltsin, still holds a commanding lead.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin declared today that the successor to the K.G.B., the Security Ministry, had proven "unreformable" and ordered it transformed into yet another new internal security service.</p> <p>In a statement issued through the Itar-Tass news agency, Mr. Yeltsin denounced the Security Ministry as "obsolete, ineffective, a burden on the state budget and a restraining factor for the implementation of political and economic reform."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'law and legislation', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>One curious aspect of Russia's first full-fledged election campaign is that the country's leading political figure, President Boris N. Yeltsin, has ostentatiously stayed aloof from the race, neither forming a party nor endorsing any of the 13 blocs competing for seats in Parliament.</p> <p>When Mr. Yeltsin did finally address the electorate on television this evening, it was to issue an impassioned plea to support his draft constitution, which has come under considerable fire for giving the President too much power. Unless the constitution is adopted, he warned, the new Parliament will collapse into new power struggles and Russia could again come to the brink of civil war.</p> <p>The President seemed almost disdainful of the race for Parliament, and his only advice to voters was to support "responsible and honest" candidates and not those filled with hate.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>For the early-morning crowd in the women's locker room at the Olympic Swimming Pool, conversation has switched from cold remedies and perfect grandchildren to politics and more politics.</p> <p>The women, who arrive before sunrise to take advantage of the discount admission for senior citizens, treat Russia's parliamentary elections on Sunday as a personal milestone. And as pensioners and women, they sense they are the valuable catch that many parties and independent candidates are trying to hook.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>You can't throw a snowball at the World Economic Forum in this ski resort without hitting a rejected Russian reformer.</p> <p>Early last week, Russia's reformist Finance Minister, Boris Fyodorov, walked into President Boris Yeltsin's office with a him-or-me ultimatum: Either fire the inflationary Central Bank chief, Viktor Gerashchenko, who was on a ruble-printing binge to prop up inefficient industry, or I quit.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Back in the old Soviet days, an American-Soviet summit meeting was a time for the Kremlin's propaganda machine to go into overdrive with a torrent of shows, books and articles about the United States.</p> <p>No matter that most of it was tendentious stuff about the "Negro problem" or American "militarism" -- nobody listened to any of that.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>"Nothing is more contemptible," Joseph Alsop told me when I took up this line of work, "than a columnist without a Weltanschauung."</p> <p>A coherent worldview is tough to come by these days because the main threat to freedom has shifted from militant Communism to what John Leo has named "ethnomania," more tribalism than nationalism. It is exploding around Bosnia, the test NATO is failing, and is advancing in what used to be the Communist bloc.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In a sharp change of tone, the Clinton Administration's top specialist on Russia, testifying on Capitol Hill, sternly warned today that the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin must press full speed ahead with economic reforms or risk an inflation rate high enough to "topple governments, sometimes with the ugliest and most dangerous of results."</p> <p>Applying undisguised pressure on Russia after a Cabinet shuffle in Moscow that left foes of swift economic change in charge, Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State-designate, told a Senate subcommittee that "gradual reform is a prescription for hyperinflation and economic collapse."</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information', 'currency', 'finances', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>A day after President Clinton left Moscow, carrying assurances of continued Russian market reforms, their architect, Yegor T. Gaidar, announced today that he was quitting the Government because he did not think that it would pursue a sensible economic policy.</p> <p>"I cannot serve in the Government and at the same time be in opposition to it," Mr. Gaidar said, citing recent decisions made without Cabinet approval that he said contradicted his efforts to stabilize the economy and bring the budget deficit under control.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>As President Clinton and other NATO leaders prepare for a summit meeting in Brussels next week to try to define a new post-cold-war role for the alliance, the key question, according to many Western officials and diplomats, is this:</p> <p>Will the United States proposal for a "partnership for peace" between the alliance and all the former Communist countries on the continent, including Russia, convince the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary that the way is open for them to join as full members later, despite Russian objections?</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Clinton extended his hand here tonight to a Ukrainian President he had shunned, and Leonid Kravchuk returned the gesture with his first public endorsement of a three-way accord requiring Ukraine to surrender its nuclear weapons.</p> <p>A joint appearance by the Presidents after an airport meeting tonight appeared to put to rest the last doubts about whether the agreement would indeed be signed on Friday in Moscow, as Russia and the United States announced with considerable hullabaloo at the beginning of the week.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Russian leaders today that the United States is prepared to help speed up delivery of Western aid, but only after credible signs that Russia is restructuring its budget to phase out money-losing industries, to lower inflation and to better assist the unemployed.</p> <p>The mantra for President Clinton's visit, Treasury officials say, is: more Russian reform in return for more Western money more quickly.</p>
['currency', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>As the ruble plummeted to new lows and ordinary Russians lined up to exchange them for dollars, President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister apparently failed to agree today on a new Government, leaving the future of the reformist Finance Minister in doubt.</p> <p>After six hours of talks, Mr. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, left for their country houses, and a spokesman said they might meet again on Wednesday. Their inability to announce a new Government left a degree of suspense surrounding Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, who has come to symbolize the fate of economic reform after the resignation Sunday of Yegor T. Gaidar.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>Russia's Finance Minister, who has come to represent Moscow's commitment to rapid economic reform, announced tonight that he was quitting the Government after President Boris N. Yeltsin named a new Cabinet that is expected to put higher priority on protecting industrial jobs than in fighting inflation.</p> <p>After four days of intense negotiations and financial panic that sent the ruble to new lows, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, announced the new Cabinet and declared, "the period of market romanticism is now over."</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Clinton Administration officials voiced serious concern today about the announced resignation of Russia's Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, an advocate of rapid economic reform, fearing his departure could slow Moscow's move to a market economy.</p> <p>American officials hesitated to express worry when another leading reformer, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, resigned last Sunday. Trying to put the best face on that resignation, which came on the day President Clinton left Moscow after meeting President Boris N. Yeltsin, American officials said they were still confident that reforms would continue to move apace, in part because Mr. Fyodorov was still in place.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia called today for an urgent meeting of United Nations Security Council Foreign Ministers in Geneva to discuss the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina as France prepared a new peace initiative based on the premise that Europe needs Washington's help to stop the fighting in the Balkans.</p> <p>An aide to President Francois Mitterrand said the new French plan might involve additional mediators, perhaps an American and a Russian, in the peace negotiations. Talks mediated by Lord Owen, representing the European Union, and Thorvald Stoltenberg, representing the United Nations, have made scant progress in recent months.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>In a tour of the world's horizons from his perspective as Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey said today that his major concerns include the possibility of destructive hyperinflation in Russia, political and ethnic tensions that could fragment Ukraine and a military buildup in North Korea.</p> <p>While none of these events pose an immediate danger to the United States, "the end of the cold war does not mean the end of conflict, nor the end to threats to our security and to that of our friends and allies," Mr. Woolsey said during testimony at a public session of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States, Britain and France urged Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today to press ahead with plans to reopen the besieged Bosnian Government-controlled airport at Tuzla for mercy flights and send new troops to guard Srebrenica, a "safe area" for Muslim refugees in eastern Bosnia.</p> <p>The United Nations representatives of the three countries also told Mr. Boutros-Ghali that he already had the authority to call for NATO air attacks against the encircling Serbs if necessary, and that he did not need new permission from the Security Council.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Clinton came to this wintry capital today and embraced President Boris N. Yeltsin almost without qualification, despite the surprisingly strong nationalist, anti-Yeltsin revolt evident in the parliamentary elections on Dec. 12.</p> <p>On his first visit to Russia as President, Mr. Clinton and his top aides conceded that many people here had suffered acute economic privation in the transition from Communism to a free market. They spoke of the need for a redesigned net of social services to ease the pain. But they nonetheless pressed for a sustained or, in some areas, increased pace of reform.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The upper chamber of Russia's new Parliament today elected one of President Boris N. Yeltsin's close lieutenants as Chairman, while the lower house rang again to Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's antics.</p> <p>The meetings of the two chambers, separated by several miles, were played out against the pomp and traffic jams of President Clinton's official visit, which added yet another dimension to Moscow's political maneuverings.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>For most Russian politicians, the Clinton visit was a pleasant but not particularly relevant event during a week in which the new Russian Parliament was setting the stage for new battles with a new set of players elected just a month ago.</p> <p>"It would have been better if he had put it off for two months," said the former Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil Popov, "until things here had had a chance to sort themselves out." Vadim V. Bakatin, who served as head of the K.G.B. during Mikhail S. Gorbachev's last months in power, said that he was still waiting for the American President to present new ideas to help lead the world in the post-cold war era.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Less than a week before the NATO and Moscow summit meetings, the Administration is still groping for a coherent strategy as President Clinton prepares to embark on his most comprehensive and ambitious overseas trip.</p> <p>On Russia, the Administration retreated from the position outlined by Strobe Talbott, its leading Russia strategist, just two weeks ago that American policy is now to find a way to de-emphasize rapid economic change in favor of maintaining living standards.</p>
['public opinion', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As President Clinton left Moscow today, reaction to his visit seemed to divide roughly into two camps.</p> <p>One group tried to weigh the visit in the categories of old, seeking to revive an era when Soviet-American summit meetings reverberated through the world, moving markets and easing fears. They debated what was the most important result, the tripartite arms agreement with Ukraine, the agreement to buy Russian uranium or the promise to aim nuclear missiles away from one another.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>At the meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow last week, the American business executives had a Protestant minister open their luncheon by delivering a prayer for the Russian economy. "Dear God," he intoned, "we pray for this land. For wise decisions. Do not let us lose hope."</p> <p>It was a fitting way to begin their session and a fitting summary of American economic diplomacy toward Russia today, which relies almost as much on prayer as on policy.</p> <p>It is not that there is no substance behind the American approach to Russia today. There is. And it is not that there is no money behind it, either. It is that no more money will be delivered, or make a substantive difference, unless President Boris N. Yeltsin puts together a viable, concrete plan to restructure his budget in a way that will curb inflation, end subsidies to unprofitable state industries and create a body of laws to support a free market. Bear Hugs and Vodka</p> <p>That was President Clinton's message to the Russian leader this week. It was sugarcoated in a number of ways, with many bear hugs and vodka toasts, but underneath there was always the same theme: "More money for Russia, more quickly, but only after more reform."</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>In a report meant to strike a new blow at the memory of Lenin and to undermine latter-day Communists, President Boris N. Yeltsin today officially rehabilitated the victims of the deadly Bolshevik repression of the Kronstadt uprising of 1921.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>President Clinton announced tonight that the United States, Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement for the destruction of Ukraine's entire nuclear arsenal, 175 long-range missiles and more than 1,800 warheads. He described the deal as "a hopeful and historic breakthrough" that would not only benefit the three signers but enhance world security.</p> <p>If it takes effect -- and questions lingered tonight about important details of ratification and timing -- the agreement would mean that all three of the non-Russian republics left with nuclear weapons at the breakup of the Soviet Union would have undertaken to surrender them voluntarily. Kazakhstan and Belarus, the other two countries, agreed last year to give up their warheads. Accidents Feared</p> <p>Ukraine was the most difficult case, and the negotiations on the deal continued by telephone through this morning. Their success, Administration officials hoped, would help to reduce tensions between Moscow and Kiev, shore up the tottering Ukrainian economy and stabilize a shaky region.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Three months after Russia's last Parliament came to a violent end, a newly elected Federal Assembly starts work on Tuesday amid signs that it, too, will become mired in confrontation and political grandstanding.</p> <p>With its two chambers housed in separate buildings, even the opening-day ceremonies will take place on a divided note. President Boris N. Yeltsin is to give a brief welcoming address to the Federation Council, or upper house, while Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin is to speak to the lower chamber, or State Duma, across town.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>In a strong indication that the Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin is concerned about Western reaction to hisnew, more conservative Government, he met today with Boris G. Fyodorov, a reformer who would not accept a position in the new Cabinet, and told him to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday.</p> <p>Mr. Fyodorov, the young Finance Minister who announced on Thursday that he was quitting, said today in an interview with Britain's Sky News television that his resignation as Finance Minister had not yet been accepted. He suggested there was a "1,000 to 1" chance he might remain in the Government, which would seem to require his promotion to Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>The poor relations between Ukraine and Russia, already tense over Ukraine's nuclear weapons and its inability to pay for Russian oil, are likely to be aggravated by the election on Jan. 16 of the first President of Crimea.</p> <p>A peninsula with balmy weather and a beautiful coast that juts into the Black Sea, Crimea is home to the Black Sea Fleet, an aging fleet of rusting ships that Ukraine and Russia continue to bicker over.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>When Elisabeth Rehn joined a televised debate among Finland's 11 presidential candidates last month, a questioner demanded to know what she was doing there. As the nominee of a tiny party composed mostly of Swedish-speaking Finns, Mrs. Rehn surely did not believe that she had a serious chance of winning, she was told.</p> <p>But this month she confounded political experts here by finishing a strong second in the first round of balloting. She is now the odds-on choice to win the runoff on Feb. 6 and become Finland's first woman to serve as president, after serving as the country's first female Defense Minister.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>After a long internal debate on Russian policy, President Clinton plans to go to Moscow next week urging continued tough economic reforms, officials said today.</p> <p>But they added that he will also offer some new ideas about how Western aid can be used to retrain Russian workers and cushion those left unemployed by economic change.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration's policy toward the former Soviet Union is being undermined, slowly but surely, by the takeover in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine by politicians advocating populist economics that American officials believe will lead to financial ruin and political turmoil.</p> <p>Only two weeks ago President Clinton traveled to Moscow and Minsk to deliver his message: more economic reform will lead to more Western aid. The leaders there nodded in agreement and the White House pronounced the visit a rousing success.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Warning that the economy should not be left in the hands of "Red managers," Russia's Finance Minister rejected the entreaties of President Boris N. Yeltsin today and said he would not remain in the current Government.</p> <p>Boris G. Fyodorov, the young minister who had come to symbolize the future of Western-endorsed economic reform in Russia, predicted economic disaster, social explosions and Ukrainian-style hyperinflation as a consequence of the stated policies of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and the current Cabinet, which is dominated by Soviet-era managers who favor a slower, softer, subsidized transition to the market.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Two relatively young and sophisticated men, both setting policy at their nations' foreign ministries, have changed their positions radically in the past few months. Their shifts reveal much about the deterioration of Russian-American relations.</p> <p>One is Strobe Talbott, longtime friend and Oxford roommate of Bill Clinton's. He stepped down from the power and prestige of Time magazine columnist to handle President Clinton's dealings with the nations of the former Soviet Union, and was recently named Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>American Presidents used to come here to treat with monolithic governments. On his arrival here this week, Bill Clinton found no real government at all, but rather two inchoate groups, one composed of reformers, the other a mix of "go slow" pragmatists and counter-reformers, all struggling for power, staggering into an unfathomable future.</p> <p>That put the young, inexperienced President on something of a diplomatic tightrope, fighting to keep his balance.  He did not fall off, but he did not make it across without a few wobbles this way and that.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information', 'law and legislation']	<p>As President Boris N. Yeltsin gave President Clinton general assurances that economic change would proceed in Russia, its newly elected lower house of Parliament chose an anti-reform Communist stalwart as its Speaker today.</p> <p>The vote was another graphic reminder of the political realities facing Mr. Yeltsin once Mr. Clinton goes home. The victorious candidate, Ivan P. Rybkin, had the support of the Communist Party and its allies, and of the far-right nationalist party headed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton plunged into a nationally televised "town meeting" today to urge Russians to stay the course toward a free market and democracy and to find a "new definition of Russia's greatness."</p> <p>Clearly stimulated by candid and provoking questions from a live, youthful audience at the Ostankino television center in Moscow and similar groups linked by television from other cities, Mr. Clinton was alternatively professor, politician and preacher as he counseled Russians to "choose the future."</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The Ukrainian Government, taking a markedly more reserved approach to the agreement President Clinton announced on eliminating Ukraine's nuclear weapons, said today that the accord was still under discussion and might not be signed in Moscow on Friday.</p> <p>Adding to the doubts surrounding the accord, the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, has yet to mention the agreement publicly, and several members of Ukraine's Parliament said he would have a tough time winning ratification of the deal. There has been strong opposition in Parliament to giving up the weapons because of a perceived threat from Russia. Quick Stop in Kiev</p> <p>President Clinton is scheduled to stop for two hours at the airport here Wednesday afternoon for a largely symbolic meeting with President Kravchuk before flying on to Moscow. Mr. Kravchuk has been snubbed by the White House until now because of his country's refusal to destroy its nuclear arsenal, the third-largest in the world. Mr. Kravchuk is then supposed to fly to Moscow to sign the accord with Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on Friday.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The two chambers of Russia's new Parliament held their maiden sessions today in separate buildings and widely contrasting styles, the upper house sedately applauding an appeal for cooperation from President Boris N. Yeltsin and the lower house sinking into a rowdy test of strength.</p> <p>At the end of the day, it was clear that neither chamber would be the unmanageable old Congress of People's Deputies that Mr. Yeltsin disbanded by force last October, but neither would they be the tame supporters that the President had hoped for. An Angry Zhirinovsky</p> <p>It was also clear that Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the unruly and often outrageous nationalist who rode a huge protest vote to take 64 of the 450 seats in the lower house, will live up to his billing.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'currency']	<p>Negotiations over a new Russian Government continued in secret today, aggravating confusion and panic over the value of the ruble, which plunged another 6.5 percent in record trading, to a low of 1,607 to the dollar.</p> <p>In a brief report this evening, Interfax news agency said Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, who has come to symbolize the future of economic reform, was reappointed Finance Minister in a partial agreement between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Negotiations between the warring parties of Bosnia and Herzegovina broke up in acrimonious disagreement today, and senior United States and European officials said there was no chance of a settlement before the Feb. 21 deadline set by NATO for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from Sarajevo under a threat of air strikes.</p> <p>"To be honest, we had no progress over the past three days," said Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations mediator in the negotiations between Bosnia's Serbs, Croats and the Muslim-led Government. He said the talks would resume at the end of the month, a week after the NATO deadline.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>First, President Boris N. Yeltsin dissolved the Russian Parliament. Before the next Parliament was even able to sit in session, he confiscated its building and banished the deputies to a less prestigious address across the street.</p> <p>Then, he suggested that if lawmakers were dissatisfied with those cramped quarters, they could relocate to a remote edge of Moscow.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Since Russia's best-known economic reformers left the Government two weeks ago, there has much been casting about for signs of impending salvation or doom, enough to drive omen mavens back to bird entrails.</p> <p>The Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, has suddenly doubled his own inflation forecasts, now projecting a rate of 15 to 18 percent a month by the end of the year. The state energy sector warned of "a complete paralysis of economic activity" unless somebody started paying bills owed to it. The Economics Minister, Aleksandr N. Shokhin, talked of price controls and unpaid Government obligations of 7 trillion rubles ($4.4 billion), which Mr. Chernomyrdin vows to pay.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>As the United States and its Western allies seek to shape a joint response to Saturday's deadly mortar attack in Sarajevo, they are being forced to maneuver around an irate Russia trying to stop them from sending NATO warplanes against Bosnia's Serbs, with whom it feels linked by ethnic and religious bonds.</p> <p>This means any plan the allies adopt must conform with existing Security Council resolutions since they dare not ask the Council for new authority for fear of running into a Russian veto.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The political rearrangement in Russia that began with the governmental reshuffling of mid-1992 has come to an end. The departure of the Cabinet's leading economic and political reformers last month erased all doubts. Until then, despite reactionary successes in the December parliamentary elections, it was possible to believe that the necessary reforms would continue, even if only in half-measures. But now it is clear that there will be no reforms, not even bad ones.</p> <p>Under the guise of social welfare policies, a planned economy will be re-established. Its executors will be Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his allies. President Boris Yeltsin has become merely decorative. If reform is to come, the work will be done by others.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The tension between the United States and Russia over the war in Bosnia and Russia's spying in Washington has raised the question in the minds of many: Just what is the relationship between America and Russia today? Allies? Not exactly. Enemies? Not really. Acquaintances? That's not it either.</p> <p>Across Washington last week, officials, diplomats and lawmakers struggled with that question as Russia has engaged in more and more behavior that seems hostile to American interests.</p>
['medicine and health', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The Administration announced today that Russia had agreed to allow the sale of virtually all drugs made in the United States and approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p> <p>The agreement, which takes effect immediately, was described by the F.D.A. as the first in which any nation has formally agreed to rely so heavily on another nation to insure that drugs sold are safe and effective.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Two years after he set Russia on the road of economic and political reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin acknowledged today that the results had so far been disappointing and called on his opponents to join him in "a new political style" to move the country forward.</p> <p>"Let us at long last recognize that so far we have a weak state and that there is no elementary order in the country," Mr. Yeltsin said in a long-awaited address before a joint session of the newly elected Parliament.</p>
['espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The lawyer representing Aldrich H. Ames, the Central Intelligence Agency official accused of spying for Moscow, said today that Mr. Ames would fight the charges against him, raising the prospect of a messy trial that could involve secrets the agency would rather not disclose.</p> <p>The lawyer for Mr. Ames's wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, also issued a statement denouncing the accusations in a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit that was unsealed on Tuesday after the couple were arrested.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Aldrich H. Ames was well enough off that besides owning an expensive house and car, he donated a total of $5,000 to the Democratic Party in 1990 and 1991.</p> <p>Mr. Ames, who is accused of spying for Moscow, gave $1,500 to the Democratic National Committee in September 1991, an additional $1,000 in February 1992 and $2,500 after the Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1992, according to Federal Election Commission records. Earlier, he contributed $500 to the party in 1990.</p>
['treaties', 'bombs and explosives', 'demonstrations and riots', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Russia and Georgia signed a cooperation treaty today that will increase Moscow's military influence there and tighten its ties with the embattled Georgian Government of Eduard A. Shevardnadze.</p> <p>The treaty, one of two dozen documents signed today by Mr. Shevardnadze and President Boris N. Yeltsin in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, will allow Russia to keep three military bases on Georgian soil past 1995, while committing the Russian military to train and supply the Georgian Army.</p>
['space', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The space shuttle Discovery streaked into an icy dawn sky today, carrying the first Russian astronaut ever to be launched in an American spacecraft.  Space officials hope the mission starts a new era of Russian-American cooperation in space</p> <p>Discovery blasted off on its eight-day mission at its scheduled 7:10 A.M. launching time, although there had been concern that unusually cold weather might cause a delay. It was the 18th flight for Discovery, the 60th in the program and the first this year.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>The fragile confidence of Russia's Jews in their ability to make a free life for themselves here has been badly shaken by the rise of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist, and the setback suffered by economic reformers in the Russian Government.</p> <p>Jewish officials and community leaders, so confident six months ago about creating a thriving Jewish life here, now speak in worried tones of the need to prepare their children and grandchildren to emigrate, just in case. They say they do not want to overreact, but must prepare for a continuing shift toward xenophobia in Russian attitudes.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Looking wan but gleeful, two of President Boris N. Yeltsin's most bitter enemies strolled out of a maximum-security prison today under an amnesty granted by the new Parliament to hard-liners who tried to overthrow his Government in October.</p> <p>Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the former Speaker of Parliament, was the first to emerge from Lefortovo Prison, appearing tired but relieved after a last-minute effort by Mr. Yeltsin to block the release failed.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a sober address from the Oval Office, President Clinton said today that the United States and its allies were determined to carry out air strikes against Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo unless they "fully comply" with a NATO ultimatum to withdraw heavy weapons by 7 P.M. Eastern time Sunday night.</p> <p>As Serbian trucks continued to withdraw big guns from around the Bosnian capital, Mr. Clinton spoke of "some encouraging signs" that the threat of action might compel the Serbs to meet the allies' demands. By this afternoon, American officials said, it appeared that fewer than 100 Serbian mortars, artillery pieces and other heavy weapons remained in place.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Mikhail Zhvanetsky, Russia's most popular comedian, was recently asked about reform.</p> <p>"Much has changed, but nothing has happened," he began, but then paused in feigned confusion. "Or is it that much has happened, and nothing has changed?"</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States was caught by surprise by a Russian announcement that it would send troops to Sarajevo to help the Bosnian Serbs withdraw or surrender control of their heavy weapons, as required by the NATO ultimatum last week, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>The officials welcomed the Russian offer, as well as a Russian-brokered promise by the Bosnian Serbs to comply with the NATO ultimatum, but added that the United States was still wholeheartedly committed to launching air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs defied it.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'law and legislation', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russian officials reportedly complained last November that State Department officials were discouraging them from releasing documents about prisoners of war in Vietnam. The report came in a classified cable made available today by Administration officials angry over President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam.</p> <p>According to the cable, the Russians said they were receiving a mixed message from Washington: while many American officials were pressing them to turn over as many documents as possible about the missing, others were saying that releasing such documents would hurt relations.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Sharp tensions between Russia and the United States over NATO's threat of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs seemed to ease today after a bizarrely delayed telephone conversation between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>After failing for two days to make telephone contact, a lapse that seemed mysterious in these days of satellite communications, the two men spoke for about 30 minutes. Each side blamed the other for the delay.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States, supported by Britain, France and Russia, appealed to China today to put renewed pressure on North Korea to open its nuclear installations to international inspection and warned they will start pressing for Security Council sanctions against the Pyongyang Government if it has not done so by Feb. 21.</p> <p>This is the starting date for a three-day meeting of the 35-nation executive board of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which, in the absence of any new North Korean concessions by then, is expected to endorse the agency's view that it can no longer give the the assurances it needs to about the peaceful nature of North Korea's nuclear program.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The F.B.I. is accusing Aldrich Hazen Ames, the Central Intelligence Agency officer arrested on espionage charges this week, of betraying at least 10 Soviet citizens working for American intelligence, Government officials said today. All were convicted of treason and executed in Moscow by the Soviet authorities, they said.</p> <p>The agents, reported to have been identified by Mr. Ames, included the first two intelligence officers the Federal Bureau of Investigation were able to recruit from the Soviet Embassy in Washington and a senior Soviet counterintelligence official in Moscow responsible for catching American spies.</p>
['espionage', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Even as his Administration warned that it would not tolerate more spying by Russia, President Clinton took pains today to keep the case of a C.I.A. officer accused of being a double agent from leading to a rupture in relations between Washington and Moscow.</p> <p>The mixture of sternness and apprehension reflected a concern that the embarrassing episode would be used by the Administration's opponents to limit American aid to Russia while Mr. Clinton's advisers believe that such a course could hurt President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Aldrich Ames, the C.I.A. official accused of being a Russian penetration agent, was "fluttered" -- polygraphed -- in 1986 and again in 1991.</p> <p>If he is found guilty, that would prove the "lie detector" is unreliable. It would show how the C.I.A. was lulled into a false sense of security by a device that law enforcement officers know is a splendid tool to scare suspects into confessions, but could be easily fooled by a natural liar, a psychopath or a trained spy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The European Union called today for "the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo" and said that air power might be used to do so. But the bloc set no deadline for Serbian forces to lift their 22-month encirclement of the Bosnian capital.</p> <p>"The aim should be to bring about the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo using all the means necessary, including the use of air power," the European Union foreign ministers said in a statement after meeting here.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The head of the International Monetary Fund complained today that his institution was being made a "scapegoat" by the Russians, Western governments and various experts for Russia's faltering economic reform effort. He said the responsibility lies with the Russians themselves.</p> <p>In a rare public defense, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, summoned reporters to deliver a feisty rebuttal to charges that his organization has been unrealistic or too slow in negotiating with the Russian Government the terms for more Western aid.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Despite complaints by Ukraine that Russia is not living up to its end of the deal, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said tonight that he was satisfied that the agreement to remove all of Ukraine's nuclear weapons is on track.</p> <p>A Ukrainian official said Monday that Moscow had not delivered any fuel in return for 120 nuclear warheads Ukraine had sent back to Russia. Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky said that if Russia does not provide the fuel, Ukraine "will reconsider the timetable" for shipping the remaining 1,600 warheads.</p>
['elections']	<p>If there is a nightmare ahead in Russia's relations with Ukraine, it is likely to feature Crimea, a peninsula of barren steppe and lush coastline that juts into the Black Sea.</p> <p>In January that nightmare seemed to inch closer with the election of a Russian nationalist as the first President of Crimea, a region that was part of Russia until Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine -- then a Soviet republic -- 40 years ago.</p>
['elections']	<p>The failure of President Boris N. Yeltsin's efforts last week to block Parliament's amnesty of his opponents has done more than underscore his political weakness. It also marks the beginning of the 1996 presidential campaign, in which at least some of those released will probably try to return to power.</p> <p>While no one expects a renewal of armed rebellion by Mr. Yeltsin's foes, there is a chance for civil strife, especially if the economy worsens. But it is more likely that Mr. Yeltsin's enemies will seek their revenge at the ballot box.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Ukraine has ruled out handing over its share of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia as part payment of a mounting debt for oil and gas, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy said in an interview last week.</p> <p>Six months ago, the barter looked like a promising resolution to two of the most irksome issues between Russia and Ukraine. It emerged after September talks between President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Leonid M. Kravchuk in Massandra on the Black Sea.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States and Russia aired their grievances about each other's approach to foreign policy today, and both acknowledged that they needed to cooperate better.</p> <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher flew to this military bastion of the former Soviet Union to try to reassure Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev that the United States does not take Russia for granted and to discourage him from diplomatic freelancing in places like Bosnia and the Middle East.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Defense Secretary William J. Perry, arguing that the instability in Russia could lead to a renewal of the cold war, said today that the Pentagon needed to continue nuclear weapons programs to "hedge" against that possibility.</p> <p>In a speech at George Washington University two days before he is to leave for a trip to Russia and several Soviet republics, Mr. Perry made a forceful argument for continuing military cooperation with Moscow and providing aid to the former Soviet states to dismantle their weapons of mass destruction.</p>
['elections']	<p>The former Communist establishment took a huge lead over both nationalists and market reformers in war-torn Moldova's first parliamentary elections Sunday, preliminary results indicated today.</p> <p>The Agrarian-Democratic Party had 45 percent of the vote and the pro-Russian Socialist bloc 25 percent with a third of the votes counted by late today. Vote counting is painfully slow in Moldova, an agricultural country of isolated villages and poor communications.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'espionage']	<p>In the Clinton Administration's most vigorous defense of its Russia policy since last week's arrest of a C.I.A. agent on charges of spying for Moscow, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a Congressional committee today that it was vital for Washington to support economic reform in Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Christopher also rejected charges that the Administration had backed the Russian Government too uncritically. He said the White House would not shrink from differing with Moscow when appropriate and warned Russia not to intervene in neighboringcountries except as part of an international effort.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Boris Yeltsin is in a snit. He canceled a date with Richard Nixon in Moscow because the former President dared to visit the recently freed Aleksandr Rutskoi, as well as the Communist Party chief and a motley assortment of Russian politicians, reformers, putschists and shovists, all lusting after Mr. Yeltsin's job.</p> <p>"I am glad President Clinton supports this position," huffed the Russian President, apparently over-interpreting a sympathetic cluck from Mr. Clinton over the phone. To American reporters, Mr. Clinton mildly indicated otherwise.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today angrily and abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled next week with Richard M. Nixon, saying he was "deeply, personally offended" by the former American President's visits this week with top leaders of the opposition.</p> <p>Mr. Nixon, who arrived in Moscow on Sunday on a private visit, met on Monday with former Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who led an armed uprising against Mr. Yeltsin last October and was released from prison only 10 days ago. Mr. Nixon also met with Gennadi Zyuganov, head of the Russian Communist Party, among others.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>More than a thousand tons of wheat seed purchased by the United States for this beleaguered country, where there are lines for rationed bread, are being held up by Russia, which is demanding payment of a 30 percent export duty, according to relief organizations and American diplomats here.</p> <p>Under an agreement signed by the United States and Russia two years ago, no duties are to be imposed on the import or export of relief assistance.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Those who suggest that because of its vast problems Russia should no longer be treated as a world power ignore an unpleasant but undeniable truth: Russia is the only nation in the world that can destroy the United States. Therefore Russia remains our highest foreign policy priority.</p> <p>The Russia I saw on this trip is a very different nation from the one I visited just one year ago. Optimism about the future is being replaced by pessimism. A strongly pro-American attitude has in many cases become disturbingly anti-American. Boris Yeltsin is still a political heavyweight but he is no longer a superman. When Russia was a dictatorship as part of the Soviet Union, a good relationship with the man at the top was all that was necessary. This is no longer enough.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>As several companies of Russian soldiers bid their farewells to Germany one recent evening, their mood was as cold and bitter as the night air outside the shabby train station here.</p> <p>"We're leaving because we're under orders to leave, but none of us want to go," an officer in his mid-40's said as he prepared for the 36-hour ride to Moscow. "I won't have a place to live when I get back home. The Germans killed millions of our people and burned a third of our country, and now they're all rich and we're being kicked out like dogs."</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Stung by months of criticism that it has favored Russia unduly, the Clinton Administration has altered its policies, adopting a tougher tone toward Russia and focusing more than before on other former Soviet republics.</p> <p>Although the Administration seems too proud to admit that any new approach was needed, there is an unmistakable change in tone toward a newly nationalist Russia and far more emphasis on bolstering the security and economies of the other republics.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'gas (fuel)', 'treaties', 'energy and power']	<p>As Russia's natural-gas company announced a further deep cut in supplies to Ukraine over the weekend, President Leonid M. Kravchuk suggested that the move could derail the deal to give up his country's large nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>Speaking to the television of the Commonwealth of Independent States from Washington on Saturday night, Mr. Kravchuk said: "Fulfillment of all agreements, including agreements on nuclear commitments, is possible only if the economy works. If tomorrow factories come to a halt in Ukraine, and this is a reality if there is no gas, what carrying out of commitments can be spoken of?"</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a diplomatic about-face, Russia today dropped all objections to NATO's threat to bomb the Bosnian Serbs around Gorazde, and a few hours later the Serbs announced a retreat had begun.</p> <p>"The Bosnian Serbs' military command has criminally defied the elementary norms of humanity," Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev told the Interfax News Agency. "The only alternative to air strikes is compliance by the Bosnian Serbs with their commitments."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a sharp dispute over the use of force in Bosnia, the NATO allies sought to launch air strikes today in response to the Serbian shelling of Gorazde but were blocked from doing so when the United Nations objected.</p> <p>The disagreement led to an angry telephone exchange between the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, and Yasushi Akashi, the senior United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The State Department said today that some Nigerians, with the help of their Government, have created global drug trafficking networks in Europe and Asia that officials estimate provide 35 percent to 40 percent of the heroin that enters the United States.</p> <p>The report, an annual world survey of drug cultivation and trafficking, also describes a dramatic expansion of Russian criminal groups involved in smuggling and distributing heroin from Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, where heroin production continues to increase.</p>
['public opinion']	<p>Showing widely divergent views of the world, people in the United States and Britain say the Middle East poses the biggest threat to world peace, Germans say the former Soviet bloc nations pose the major threat, and Japanese are split over whether the United States or Russia is the biggest menace to peace.</p> <p>In Japan, one of the four countries surveyed in the first half of March, 21 percent of the respondents said Russia "posed the biggest threat to world peace," while 22 percent cited the United States as the major threat -- evidently a reaction to America's huge military might and to what the Japanese see as frequent bullying by Washington.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>With far more pomp than substance, President Boris N. Yeltsin won approval today for a national peace pact with most of his political opponents.</p> <p>The treaty, signed in the Kremlin and broadcast to the nation on television, is supposed to guarantee that there will be no political violence before the next presidential elections, scheduled in 1996. That would give the Government two years of calm to focus on economic recovery.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Outsiders often describe this special place led by a bold, idealistic Governor and his round table of young advisers, some Russian, others American, as a kind of free-market Camelot.</p> <p>Nizhny Novgorod, 250 miles east of Moscow, is the model for Russian capitalism. It is an internationally acclaimed experiment in privatization to which the best Russian and Western minds -- and the most American dollars -- have been applied.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>As part of a campaign to revive old friendships with the Arabs and buttress its role as co-sponsor of the Middle East peace effort, Russia has signed a military and technical cooperation agreement with Syria, believed to be the first of its kind since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The two countries also signed protocols for expanding trade and economic and scientific cooperation, reports from Damascus said today.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Confronted by the imminent threat of NATO air strikes around Gorazde, Bosnian Serbs agreed today to a cease-fire effective on Saturday and the withdrawal of their heavy weapons from the Gorazde area, a senior United Nations official said.</p> <p>Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the former Yugoslavia, announced the accord after a 10-hour meeting in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and the political and military leaders of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Group of Seven industrial countries will invite Russia to work formally with them as they develop positions on a range of political issues, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today.</p> <p>Mr. Christopher told Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, at a meeting here that Russia, which is far poorer than the Group of Seven, could take part in the group's meetings on political issues, but not on economic ones.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>Pouring ice water over the expectation that Russia will join a loose alliance with NATO in April, a spokesman for Boris N. Yeltsin said today that the President wanted to weigh the disadvantages of membership and that a final decision could take six months.</p> <p>The President's press secretary, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, said the planned alliance did not correspond to the "political role and military might of Russia."</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Clinton, after overriding the publicly stated opinions of his own Secretary of Defense and top military officer, sent U.S. airplanes into action in Bosnia by the decision of a British general.</p> <p>How often, how hard and how deep will United States planes strike again?</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>President Clinton today approved a proposal for the wider use of NATO air power to protect Gorazde and other United Nations-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia and Herzegovina, senior Administration officials said. They said the President had directed his advisers to begin consulting immediately with European allies.</p> <p>The United States will also explore ways to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia, which is supplying the Bosnian Serbs who are threatening Gorazde, the officials added. The harder look at sanctions comes even as the Russians and Europeans are calling for a meeting with the United States and the United Nations on a timetable for eventually lifting them.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After more than a year of cogitation, President Clinton has revealed his strategy for peace in Bosnia: bombbomb.</p> <p>I can't get it through my head that he really wants to go down in history, forever down, as Bomber Bill. Will that be what it all amounted to, all the idealistic Clintonianism? Just bombs away, without ever putting a peace plan on the table? That's it?</p>
['books and literature', 'espionage']	<p>Guided by the unpublished book of a former Soviet spy, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is urgently looking into whether the K.G.B. recruited a Carter Administration official to steal secrets for Moscow, law-enforcement officials said today.</p> <p>The central accusation is that the American official, after leaving Government service, worked secretly for the K.G.B., the Soviet counterpart to the Central Intelligence Agency. He is said to have seduced the daughter of a C.I.A. employee and to have pressured the employee into supplying him with tidbits of classified information, which he then passed on to Moscow.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>Faced with turmoil and instability along its southern flank, Russia has appealed to the West for a review of cold-war-era limits on the conventional weapons it is allowed to deploy in its border regions, military analysts say.</p> <p>Moscow's main argument is that when it agreed to the 1990 treaty limiting such forces, it was a different country with an entirely different set of military concerns centered around the possibility of a war with NATO. Now, the Russians say, their main concern is instability on their southern flank.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'treaties', 'espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Russian military has repositioned forces along its northern and southern flanks as they return from Central Europe, raising concern among NATO and United States officials who say the redeployment exceeds limits scheduled to take effect next year under a treaty reducing conventional weapons in Europe.</p> <p>The deployments, and Moscow's effort to renegotiate the treaty to accommodate them, are emerging as a major irritant in the Pentagon's efforts to forge closer relations with the Russian military.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Despite the shooting down of a British plane by Bosnian Serbs near the town of Gorazde, the United States and its NATO allies are determined -- at least for the moment -- to respond with minimal force in hopes of persuading the Serbs to agree to a cease-fire and return to negotiations, American and Western officials said today.</p> <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher conferred by telephone today with Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, shortly before Mr. Kozyrev flew to Belgrade for urgent talks with Serbian leaders.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Ukraine, barely de-Sovietized and economically unreformed, is hoping to take advantage of new strains in the American-Russian relationship by promoting itself as a bulwark against any potential Russian imperialism.</p> <p>Ukrainian officials and senior Western diplomats here discern growing mistrust and disillusionment between Moscow and Washington, where the Clinton Administration is being pushed to regard the Russians as rivals instead of partners, as Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican, recently put it.</p>
['currency', 'treaties', 'international trade and world market', 'taxation']	<p>In a move bound to increase concern in the West about Russian neo-imperialism, the Prime Ministers of Russia and Belarus signed a treaty today to unify their monetary systems and lift customs barriers.</p> <p>In a set of agreements that will be carried out in stages, Belarus will give up the right to control its money supply, handing over all monetary and credit controls to the Russian Central Bank. Russia will also receive a free lease on military bases for its troops.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the highest-ranking Israeli official ever to come to Moscow, heard a promise from the Russian Prime Minister today that a new wave of anti-Semitism could not be provoked in Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Rabin, whose visit has been marked by emotional meetings with Jews in Moscow, has been seeking public assurances from high Russian officials that they will act against manifestations of anti-Semitism. He is also here to discuss prospects for advancing the Middle East peace talks, which Moscow is co-sponsoring with Washington.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'biographical information']	<p>From the attic of the building that houses Kindergarten No. 392, there is a clear line of fire to the parking lot of the Krasnopresnensky Baths, 200 yards away.</p> <p>At 5:45 P.M. on April 5, Otari V. Kvantrishvili, keeping to routine, left the red-brick bathhouse surrounded by bodyguards. Sportsman, philanthropist, businessman, politician -- loved and admired by many for his support of war veterans, orphans and elderly athletes -- Mr. Kvantrishvili was also, as everyone seemed to know, a gangster, one of the most powerful bosses in Russia. At 46, he was a "thief in law," as the Russian phrase goes, a Godfather, one of the untouchables whom many Russians think are the country's real leaders.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>A Russian special envoy indicated today that Bosnian Serb leaders had assured him they would cease their offensive against the United Nations-declared "safe area" of Gorazde, the Muslim enclave where NATO aircraft bombed Serbian forces earlier this week.</p> <p>"I think I've got a commitment from the Serbs that it is not their intention to resume fighting," the Russian envoy, Vitaly Churkin, said. "I may be able to introduce some new elements in the situation to reinforce the effective cease-fire that is there now."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina said today that the peace plan embraced on Friday by the United States, Russia and several European nations is flawed because it does not include a mechanism to insure that Serbian nationalists withdraw from the land they have conquered.</p> <p>"Once an agreement is reached, I think force should be used to implement that agreement," the Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said. "We are looking for guarantees. We are looking for a commitment from the international community."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>Senior Russian officials said today that Moscow was seeking permission from the Security Council to deploy a peacekeeping force of several thousand troops in war-torn Georgia to reinforce a fragile cease-fire there and oversee the return of thousands of refugees.</p> <p>Diplomats say the Council is likely to give its cautious assent next week to the new peacekeeping operation, which would involve troops from Russia and other former Soviet republics that are now members of the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>In an effort to stem the spread of nuclear weapons, the Clinton Administration has asked Moscow to disclose how much plutonium and highly enriched uranium it has and where it can be found.</p> <p>The proposal is part of a broad Administration effort to insure that nuclear material in Russia is properly accounted for and is stored safely. It also reflects growing concern that Russia's system for keeping track of its nuclear material is not up to Western standards and that the Russian bureaucracy needs to be prodded into taking stronger action.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>Showing that 20 years of exile had only deepened his thunder, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn used his first news conference back on Russian soil today to fire bolts at Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Westernizing reformers, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and, above all, unrepentant Communist "oppressors and executioners."</p> <p>Like a prophet of old emerging from long seclusion to castigate a fallen world, the 75-year-old writer held forth with passion and eloquence for almost two hours on Russia's need for repentance and reconciliation, on the errors of its post-Communist course, on the sufferings of the Russian nation.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia formally joined the United States and the European Union today in a reinvigorated international effort to end the two-year-old war in Bosnia, supporting a plan that calls on the Bosnian Serbs to cede nearly a third of the land they control to the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government.</p> <p>Under the plan backed today, that Government, now federated with the Bosnian Croats, would be given control of 51 percent of the country, while the Bosnian Serbs, who now control more than 70 percent, would receive 49 percent.</p>
['television']	<p>"Politics in Russia is just intrigue," says President Boris N. Yeltsin's former press secretary, setting the theme for tonight's incisive two-hour "Frontline" report.</p> <p>"The Struggle for Russia" covers the tumultuous two and a half years after the failed August 1991 coup against Mikhail S. Gorbachev, then president of the expiring Soviet Union, from which Mr. Yeltsin emerged as the symbol of a new, democratic Russia. The idealism of that August, the narrator says, seems "a distant and melancholy memory."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Leaders of the warring Muslim, Serbian and Croatian factions in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been invited by international mediators to peace talks in southern France early next week, officials said today.</p> <p>The mediators, Lord Owen of the European Union and Thorvald Stoltenberg of the United Nations, plan to meet Tuesday in Geneva with representatives of Britain, France, Russia, the United States and Germany, which make up the so-called "contact group" trying to end the fighting in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>In the early morning on a not quite empty city street a week ago, two men fired at each other with Kalashnikov assault rifles in a shootout that left one of the gunmen, a reputed member of organized crime, dead.</p> <p>As slayings go, it was not an unusual confrontation in the new, crime-ridden Russia -- except that the one who walked away was a young, reform-minded member of Parliament.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States has decided to support a European strategy for ending the war in Bosnia that envisions possible punitive steps against either warring party that does not accept an emerging peace plan, senior American and French officials said today.</p> <p>President Clinton told the French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, in a meeting on Tuesday that it was important for American, Western European and Russian negotiators to work as one to complete a map dividing the country, present it to the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croatian federation based in Sarajevo, and make clear that there would be consequences if either side rejected it, the officials said.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton's visits to Latvia and Poland next week, as well as his participation in the Group of Seven summit meeting in Naples a few days later, signal a more comprehensive and strategically coherent U.S. policy toward the former Soviet bloc.</p> <p>Generated by a working alliance between the National Security Council and the Defense Department, the policy seeks to sustain realistic cooperation with Russia while also enlarging the scope of European security. Both the symbolism and the substance of the President's trip are likely to underline these important themes.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union will meet here on Tuesday to complete what they regard as a final peace plan for Bosnia, but already it is clear that the Bosnian Government and Croatia are preparing for a coordinated war on the Serbs, not an imminent settlement.</p> <p>The plan, the fruit of several months' work, would grant 51 percent of Bosnia to the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, in federation with the Bosnian Croats, and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs. Its details are now broadly known and include an attempt to satisfy the Muslims by linking their eastern enclave of Gorazde to Sarajevo and by insuring that they can return to several towns seized by the Serbs, including Visegrad and Zvornik.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Complaining that Washington has again neglected to consult adequately with Moscow on a vital issue of international security, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev refused today to support a Security Council resolution drafted by the United States that would impose sanctions on North Korea.</p> <p>It was the second time this week that Mr. Kozyrev had lashed out at the United States. On Tuesday, he warned Congress that its vote to end the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government could ignite "a new world war."</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Turkey's foreign-policy makers welcomed the breakup of the Soviet Union as an opportunity to create a sphere of influence ranging "from the Adriatic to China's border," as the catch phrase often heard a year or two ago went.</p> <p>High hopes marked initial advances into the region. But now hope has been replaced by worry that Russia wants to restore its hold over the Caucasus and Central Asia, and fear that Islamic militants might come to power in the region. This fear has made some top officials tolerant of otherwise disliked but secular leaders like President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>North Korea deepened its confrontation with the United Nations and the Clinton Administration late Monday, announcing that it would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency and that the agency's inspectors would no longer be allowed in the country.</p> <p>The declaration would appear to mean that the two inspectors in North Korea will be expelled, but the statement did not explicitly refer to them. Without inspectors present, the spent fuel rods extracted from North Korea's largest nuclear reactor during the last month could be converted into weapons fuel without detection.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>To many Russians, the absence of Soviet veterans at the ceremonies marking D-Day is another reminder of what they see as the West's reluctance to embrace the new Russia with much more than lofty words.</p> <p>"The overall success of the Allies was due to the fact that the Soviet Union helped to accelerate the defeat of fascism," said Ivan Yershov, a 73-year-old retired colonel. "Now, the absence of our veterans at the ceremonies strikes a blow to the honor and worthiness of the alliance as a whole."</p>
['treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia is concealing efforts to develop advanced chemical weapons, despite its pledge to disclose details of its poison gas program to the United States, Clinton Administration officials said today.</p> <p>That assessment illustrates the problems that Washington has in dealing with the new Russia, as Moscow has pledged to cooperate with the West, but has been dragging its feet on putting some important arms control accords into effect.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In the Soviet era, one of the favored spas of the Communist elite was the Georgian province of Abkhazia, where the cragged range of the Caucasus, snow-covered most of the year, lies within sight of mile after mile of Black Sea beaches.</p> <p>The land now lies in ruins. At hillside homes with sweeping views, artillery shells collapsed the roofs, and looters followed. Downtown, buildings are charred skeletons. Luxury beach-front hotels are empty hulks.</p>
['energy and power', 'law and legislation', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>An unusual trade agreement in which the United States has tried to cement good relations with Russia and stabilize the Yeltsin Government is under siege. The uproar is a lesson in what happens when noble foreign-policy goals clash with rigid trade laws that were constructed to protect American industry.</p> <p>The agreement, signed in March, allowed the Russians to export to the United States far more uranium fuel for nuclear power plants at a far lower price than would normally be allowed under American trade laws. At the same time it required that the Russians pay American uranium producers a subsidy to compensate for the falling price caused by the exports.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States will ask North Korea to surrender some 8,000 plutonium-bearing reactor fuel rods to a third country, like Russia or China, or entomb them indefinitely in a concrete sarcophagus as part of any settlement to the dispute over its nuclear program.</p> <p>Any country receiving the spent reactor fuel would be expected to reprocess it and store the extracted plutonium under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, thus insuring that North Korea does not use it for nuclear weapons.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States, Russia and the European Union have agreed on a map for the territorial division of Bosnia designed to end the 27-month war in the former Yugoslav republic, a spokeswoman for the French Foreign Ministry said today.</p> <p>The map, the fruit of several months of consultation with the warring factions in Bosnia, is set to be formally approved by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia and European Union ministers at a meeting in Geneva on July 5.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In what Western diplomats said was a concession to nationalist sentiment here, the United States has agreed to postpone joint American-Russian military exercises scheduled for early July in Russia.</p> <p>Officials said the Russian Government had requested the postponement, citing nationalist opposition to the presence of American troops on Russian soil. The officials said they hoped the exercises, which have been supported by the Russian Defense Ministry, would take place later and begin in the United States rather than in Russia.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Senior Russian officials have dismissed charges by the Clinton Administration that Russia is concealing information about the development and testing of chemical weapons.</p> <p>Last Friday the State Department charged that Russia had broken an agreement  between the two countries to exchange information on their chemical stockpiles.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>A former director of the Soviet Union's largest missile factory won Ukraine's presidential election on Sunday after promising to cooperate more closely with Russia and to speed economic reform.</p> <p>The victory by the industrialist, Leonid D. Kuchma, shocked nationalists, who fear he will push Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. He denies any such intention but he must deal quickly with a deepening split between nationalistic western Ukraine and the Russian-speaking eastern part of the country.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Moving to end one of the most heated disputes still festering between Russia and a former Soviet republic, Moscow formally agreed today to withdraw its remaining 2,000 troops from Estonia by Aug. 31.</p> <p>After months of stalled talks, President Lennart Meri of Estonia and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia compromised on a key stumbling block, the fate of the 10,000 former Soviet officers who are living in retirement in Estonia.</p>
['treaties', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The director of the F.B.I., Louis J. Freeh, signed an agreement today to cooperate with Russian authorities in the fight against Russian-based organized crime.</p> <p>Mr. Freeh and the Russian Interior Minister, Viktor Yerin, said that both countries were at risk from well-funded criminal gangs, parts of which have increasingly broad international connections. The prevalence of organized crime in Russia and the evident corruption of many underpaid officials and policemen are widely considered to be undermining the faith of ordinary Russians in market-oriented economic changes.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>A hundred yards from the idyllic spot where President Clinton plans to toast Latvia's independence and democracy after his arrival Wednesday morning, a crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 angry Russians chanted and waved signs today, denouncing Latvian "fascism" and "apartheid."</p> <p>Mr. Clinton is the first American President to visit the Baltic countries, but the symbolism of his visit is blurred by its timing.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, announced today that the agency planned to open an office in Warsaw to coordinate efforts to fight the spread of organized crime from the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>Poland has become a launching pad for Russian gangsters' western expansion, law enforcement officials here say. Mr. Freeh estimates that there are hundreds  of Russian criminal groups, and that many operate outside Russia.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances']	<p>Russia's largest investment company virtually collapsed today as more than 10,000 outraged stockholders stampeded the colonnaded headquarters of Moscow's commodities exchange, smashing windows as they tried desperately to unload their shares in the plummeting fund.</p> <p>After promising on Thursday that it would begin to buy back stock for the equivalent of about $60 a share, officials of the troubled company, MMM, announced this morning that they had cut the value to almost nothing.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev said today in Geneva that his Government had done all it could for Bosnia's Serbs and felt betrayed by their refusal to cooperate in the latest proposal for peace, the news agency Itar-Tass reported.</p> <p>Mr. Kozyrev told journalists in Geneva that Russia had made numerous initiatives to help broker an equitable peace in Bosnia that would reflect the interests of the Serbs, traditional allies of the Russians.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Despite prodding from President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would not meet a commitment to withdraw all Russian forces from the Baltic countries by Aug. 31.</p> <p>While promising that Latvia would join Lithuania by that date in finally being free of Russian troops, Mr. Yeltsin said he would not pull the remaining 2,000 Russian soldiers out of Estonia until Estonia agreed to grant wider rights to retiring officers who stay.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After several months with virtually no movement in the Bosnian war, the prospect of major changes, none of them to the liking of the West, is propelling the foreign authors of a peace plan to scramble to save it before the dire scenario they envision can unfold.</p> <p>With the Bosnian Serbs again tightening their siege of Sarajevo, Western officials see an increasing likelihood that NATO air power will be used against  them, leading to Serbian reprisals against United Nations troops and a subsequent withdrawal of some peacekeepers.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In the face of renewed attacks by Bosnian Serbs on Muslim enclaves and United Nations peacekeepers, the United States is pressing for quick retaliation, American and European officials said today.</p> <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to meet in Geneva on Saturday with the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Russia, and  is expected to urge tighter economic sanctions and stricter enforcement of United Nations-designated safe areas.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>Bowing more to pressure from Europe than from Russia, the Latvian Parliament has amended a harsh new citizenship law that infuriated Moscow.</p> <p>The amendments, passed Friday, eliminate a quota system that would have allowed only 2,000 resident aliens a year to become citizens. The law would have meant that many of the several hundred thousand Russian-speakers living in Latvia could not have been naturalized until well into the next century.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>In earlier visits intended to encourage the Poles in their scrappy opposition to Communism, American leaders have been welcomed with great warmth.</p> <p>But President Clinton will be coming to a different Poland on Wednesday and will be greeted by a people and a Government wary of what is perceived as Washington's favoritism toward Russia and its lack of understanding of Poland's security problems.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Nearly two years ago, Russia embarked on the most crucial part of its effort to become a market economy: selling the property of a state that once owned everything and thus founding a nation of property owners with a stake in the success of economic reform.</p> <p>When the end of price controls wiped out savings, the Government chose to conjure up a middle class by giving away most state property, issuing 144 million vouchers free to every Russian to turn into shares.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>President Clinton told a crowd of 35,000 Latvians today that he will rejoice with them when Russian troops complete their withdrawal from the Baltics by the end of summer, but he also appealed to the Latvians to show more tolerance of the Russian civilians who want to continue living among them.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton's soaring, Jeffersonian oratory hailing Latvia's independence was greeted with cheers, applause and the waving of American flags by the crowd packed into the central Freedom Square in Riga.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'budgets and budgeting', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances', 'space']	<p>HAVING achieved a host of spectaculars in its 35 years of existence, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has now embarked on a goal so bold, risky and surprising that the venture at times seems to unnerve the most daring of its visionaries. The agency is merging many of its leading activities with those of the Russian space program, its preeminent foe and rival during the long decades of the cold war.</p> <p>The East-West partnership involves much more than building an orbital outpost for astronauts, which is to be assembled piecemeal in space between 1997 and 2002. The two sides are also cooperating in manned space flights, aeronautics research and Earth monitoring, and are talking about joining forces to fire robotic probes toward such distant and mysterious worlds as Pluto.</p>
['elections']	<p>Ukraine and Belarus will choose Presidents on Sunday in elections that have been dominated by debates about relations with Russia.</p> <p>The outcomes, which are likely to produce a tighter core of Slavic post-Soviet states, are being closely watched in Washington and Europe, where worries about Russian neo-imperialism are growing.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>At long last, after 20 years of exile and a two-month rail trip across the troubled country that expelled him, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, Russia's mournful sage, returned to his nation's capital tonight.</p> <p>More than a thousand people, kept quietly at their distance by dozens of armed riot police, waited in the gray rain at Yaroslavl station to greet the 75-year-old writer who has savaged the current state of the country with almost as much intensity as he used when attacking Communism.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States, Russia and the European Union agreed today to seek fresh economic sanctions against Serbia in reprisal for the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of their peace plan last week. But apparently wary of risking their own fragile  unity, the powers shied away from tougher measures like a renewed threat of NATO air strikes.</p> <p>After a six-hour meeting here, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the  Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Russia defended their decision as consistent with a step-by-step approach aimed at persuading the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed territorial division of Bosnia. Serbia  is the main supporter of the Bosnian Serbs, and the new sanctions are intended to make Belgrade press its Bosnian allies to agree to the plan.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'treaties', 'war and revolution']	<p>After a spring that silenced the guns and that brought back a taste of the way life used to be, the last few weeks have seen this bedraggled city slide swiftly to a new low point in its struggle to recover from war.</p> <p>Serbian sharpshooters are once again training their high-powered rifles on the city, reviving the fears of some residents who ventured out only rarely in the months when snipers ruled the streets. Last week, the Bosnian Serbs forced the closing of the only overland route into Sarajevo and shut down the aid airlift by shooting at cargo planes.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Nationalist Serbian leaders today rejected an international plan to settle the war in Bosnia, despite a fresh warning from Russia that refusal might lead to a serious increase in the fighting. It was the third time the Serbs had rejected the peace plan.</p> <p>After meeting with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia on Sunday, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia said today that a final rejection of the peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs could result in "an escalation of the war, a huge confrontation and the possibility of air strikes."</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Russia and Germany agreed today to cooperate to prevent the smuggling of nuclear materials by tightening border controls and improving the exchange of information between their intelligence agencies, officials of both countries said.</p> <p>A series of seizures in Germany of bomb-grade nuclear material, including one large shipment of 10.5 ounces of plutonium 239 on a Moscow-Munich flight, prompted three days of talks here between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's intelligence coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, and top Russian nuclear and security officials.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The German authorities said today that the suspected smuggler of weapons-quality plutonium arrested after flying in from Moscow last week had delivered the first part of what was to be a shipment of four kilograms in a $250-million deal that almost certainly involved members of Russian security services.</p> <p>Undercover investigators negotiated with three members of a criminal group -- two Spaniards and a Colombian who had lived for a long time in Moscow -- and arrested them after receiving the first shipment before any money changed hands, the German authorities said today.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry said today that there was no plutonium 239 missing from its inventory and no evidence that Russia was the source of any of the plutonium smuggled into Germany. But the German Government immediately challenged the Russian denial, saying Bonn had clear evidence of Russian manufacture for some of the highly enriched, weapons-grade contraband.</p> <p>Germany said three separate shipments of weapons-grade nuclear material from the former Soviet bloc had been seized within the last four months. Last week in Munich, German officials arrested three non-Russian couriers on a flight from Moscow with what the officials said was 300 to 350 grams, or 10.6 to 12.3 ounces, of plutonium 239. Conflicting reports have said the amount was as little as 7 grams and as much as 500 grams.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia has no way of knowing for sure if any of its vast supply of bomb ingredients is missing, many of its own nuclear officials and scientists admit.</p> <p>An investigation of nuclear security in Russia, including interviews with numerous officials and independent experts in Moscow and in Siberia, where many nuclear materials are kept, reveals that the country is far from establishing an effective system for protecting and accounting for the plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the critical ingredients for making nuclear weapons.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to send an envoy to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin to discuss ways to prevent an illegal trade in bomb-grade nuclear materials that have been linked to Russia, German officials said today.</p> <p>Concern about the extent of black-market trade in plutonium, the most toxic and potentially destructive materials known to exist, mounted this weekend after the Bavarian police acknowledged that they had found a large amount of plutonium 239 in the baggage of a flight from Moscow at the Munich airport on Wednesday.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'currency', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>A year ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that he was preparing a "September barrage" against his sworn opposition in the Russian congress. By October, the metaphor had turned real, with tanks shelling the Parliament building.</p> <p>This August, there is an eerie stability. Monthly inflation is down to 6 percent compared with 26 percent a year ago. Salaries are worth more with the ruble stronger, and consumer spending is up. There is consensus on economic policy under Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has adopted the tight-money policies he criticized in January. Mr. Yeltsin appears more energetic, the new Parliament is behaving itself and a divided opposition is apparently looking more toward 1996 elections than to counterrevolution in the streets.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>Senior German experts presented evidence to Russian officials here today to support their contention that weapons-grade nuclear materials seized in Germany were produced in the former Soviet Union.</p> <p>In Bonn, the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, told a German newspaper that future financial aid to Russia would be linked to cooperation in stopping nuclear smuggling. "I expect other nations to take the same stand," Mr. Waigel was quoted as saying by Bild am Sonntag.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a cordial, almost jocular atmosphere, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to speed destruction of nuclear weapons, but they made only limited progress on several other issues.</p> <p>"Relations between our nations are moving forward at full speed," Mr. Clinton said at a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House after the signing of documents pledging cooperation on economic and security matters.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Suggesting that it will take more than democracy to chase intrigue from the Kremlin, one of President Boris N. Yeltsin's closest aides asserted today that an "unseen struggle" was under way among Mr. Yeltsin's advisers over his political future.</p> <p>"A struggle is going on for a democratic president, practically speaking, for the next term of Russia's history," the Russian President's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told the Interfax News Agency in an interview released this evening. "All the rest are emotions and the dust of political sideshows."</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'budgets and budgeting', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Clinton has ordered new cuts in the American arsenal of bombers and submarines and will ask President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to reciprocate with similar reductions at a meeting next week between the two leaders in Washington, Administration officials said today.</p> <p>After completing a 10-month review of nuclear policy, Defense Secretary William Perry announced today that the Administration would cut the number of Trident submarines in the Navy's fleet from 18 to 14 and the number of B-52 strategic bombers from 94 to 66.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Even as the Administration tries in talks with Cuba to put one crisis to rest, senior aides to President Clinton say he faces more troubles abroad this fall, with tensions over Bosnia about to jump back to center stage.</p> <p>The officials say they harbor no illusion that the forces that have pulled the United States toward a more prominent role in Bosnia can be kept dormant much longer. They cite a volatile mix of Serbian stubbornness in resisting peace plans, Russia's independence in easing its pressure on the Serbs and a desire in Congress to end the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government -- all of which could increase the pressure for American action, pressure that will only intensify as the November elections near.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>After the President has addressed the nation about his need to make good on his stream of threats to the Haitian junta; after partisans in Congress do their mutual somersaults on the War Powers Act; after we hail a victory over a pipsqueak principality in a war of nerves or forces -- then a real foreign-policy crisis will have to be faced.</p> <p>The Bosnian clock now stands at one month to midnight. Being put to the test is the credibility of NATO and the strength of the new relationship between the U.S. and Russia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Warning that Sarajevo again stands in danger of strangulation, President Clinton called on the United Nations today to show its resolve by enforcing its peacekeeping efforts there with additional force if necessary.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton's appeal was a veiled reference to the reluctance of United Nations commanders in recent weeks to call for punitive air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Bill Clinton's meetings with Boris Yeltsin have been, more than anything else, a series of photo-op's for reform -- a chance for America to vote its confidence (however shaky) in Russia's progress toward democracy and free markets. The summit talks today and tomorrow are different. Their real content is, for a change, diplomacy.</p> <p>The increasing political and economic stability over which President Yeltsin presides means that the two leaders can spend less time on ritual heavy breathing about the abstract principles that unite them and more on the concrete policy disagreements that divide them.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Standing in the receiving line at the state dinner tonight in his honor, President Boris N. Yeltsin mopped his brow, his cheeks and his upper lip and rearranged his jacket.</p> <p>Using hand signals, he asked the photographers to turn off their lights. No response.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration was not much pleased when, at the insistence of President Francois Mitterrand of France and other European leaders, Russians were excluded from this summer's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-Day.</p> <p>Nor were the Russians, for whom the savage struggles at Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and Stalingrad (now Volgograd) constitute a sacred chapter in their nation's history. Russians never forget that they suffered 20 times the casualties suffered by the British and the Americans in World War II, or that they inflicted three-quarters of all the losses taken by the Germans.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia tried today to sidestep disagreements on sticky issues between them, including what to do next in Bosnia, and put on a public display of shared affection as they opened a two-day summit.</p> <p>The meeting between the Russian and American leaders is the first in the capital in more than two years, and from the moment Mr. Clinton threw a bear hug around Mr. Yeltsin at the diplomatic entrance to the White House this morning, almost everything about it seemed designed to project warmth and goodwill.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>When Boris N. Yeltsin arrives in the United States this weekend, America will witness the return of a salesman. The Russian leader aims to do statesmanly things, of course. He will address the United Nations General Assembly. He will hold a summit meeting with President Clinton. But mostly, in business meetings in New York, Washington and Seattle, Mr. Yeltsin hopes to convince American executives that Russia is a blue-chip investment.</p> <p>"His personal charm can do a lot," said Georgi A. Satarov, an aide to Mr. Yeltsin. "The American businessmen will tell him what are the necessary conditions for investment and our President will explain that such changes are already happening."</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In a new sign of division over the path to peace in Bosnia, Russia has issued a strong private message to President Clinton warning him not to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, Administration officials said today.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton said last month that he would press for a lifting of the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs had not accepted a peace settlement drafted by the Western allies and Russia by Oct. 15. The embargo bars arms shipments to all sides in the conflict, but hurts the Bosnian Government most because the Bosnian Serbs are much better armed.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market']	<p>In a good-will gesture for a summit meeting with Russia next week, President Clinton signed a declaration today that frees the former Soviet state from one of the central political weapons of the cold war, a law tying trade conditions to emigration, senior Administration officials said.</p> <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who will meet with Mr. Clinton in Washington next week, had contended that his country remained unfairly burdened by the 20-year-old American law, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was intended to embarrass Moscow for policies that made it difficult for Jews to emigrate.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>As he prepared to address the United Nations and got ready for a two-day meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, President Clinton began to search yesterday for a way out of a promise that threatens to divide the United States from Russia and other allies over efforts toward Bosnia.</p> <p>In an afternoon meeting with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Mr. Clinton began to explore whether the Bosnian Government might be satisfied with a plan that would delay his pledge to seek United Nations approval for a lifting of the arms embargo against his Muslim-dominated forces if the Serbs did not agree to an American-backed peace agreement by Oct. 15.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>An increasingly disquieting feature of Russian politics is President Boris Yeltsin's ambiguous attitude toward integration with the former Soviet republics.</p> <p>Big unanswered questions hover in the air. With which members of the Commonwealth of Independent States -- if any -- should Russia integrate? How? On what basis? With what goals? And with what consequences for Russia, those republics and the rest of the world?</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Security guards bowed, secretaries crossed themselves and the Mayor of Moscow humbly kissed his hand. In what has become a ritual of Russian power politics, the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church, Aleksy II, made a slow, solemn entrance into the temporal world of doting bureaucrats and elected officials.</p> <p>This time, they offered him a cathedral.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In introducing a resolution to lift an arms embargo against the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Clinton Administration has done more than meet its own deadline for action if the Bosnian Serbs continued to reject a three-month-old peace plan.</p> <p>The United States is also challenging its European allies and Russia to come up with some better way to break the stalemate as Sarajevo and other parts of Bosnia face a third bleak winter of war.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid']	<p>Ukraine, whose economy has nosedived since independence three years ago, won pledges for hundreds of millions of dollars in international financial support today to prop up the market-oriented reforms of its new President, Leonid D. Kuchma.</p> <p>Mr. Kuchma, the 55-year-old former head of a missile factory who is making his first foreign trip since his election in July, said that as a result of the pledges, he sees a "stable, economically powerful, democratic and independent Ukraine, which will be integrated into the world's political and economic system."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances']	<p>After a strong speech to Parliament by the Prime Minister defending an austere draft budget for 1995, the Russian Government survived a vote of no-confidence today in the lower house.</p> <p>Of the 450 deputies, 194 voted against the Government, 32 votes short of the required majority of 226. There were 54 votes against the no-confidence motion, while 55 deputies abstained and 147 deputies did not even show up to vote.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>As President Saddam Hussein pulled back most of his troops from the border with Kuwait, the United States sought allied support today for a plan that would require Iraq to permanently withdraw its better-equipped Republican Guards but would allow 50,000 regular Army troops to remain in the area.</p> <p>The proposal was less sweeping than an idea suggested on Monday by Defense Secretary William J. Perry: a huge demilitarized zone that would have excluded all tanks and heavy artillery and left Mr. Hussein with virtually no military control over the southern part of his country.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar.</p> <p>While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble; called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers.</p> <p>Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21.</p> <p>In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called "Black Tuesday" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an "unmasking trial," the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era.</p> <p>But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence.</p> <p>"I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors," said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. "But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame."</p> <p>Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market.</p> <p>After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured.</p> <p>Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.)</p> <p>Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now.</p> <p>During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar.</p> <p>With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today.</p> <p>But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies.</p> <p>During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. "Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises," he said. If the latter, "the ruble will continue to fall."</p> <p>Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded.</p> <p>As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases.</p> <p>Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation.</p> <p>Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment.</p> <p>"Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen," Mr. Lindbaek said. "In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold."</p> <p>Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs.</p> <p>Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: "Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies."</p> <p>Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. "In contrast to the Russian Government," he said, "the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you."</p> <p>Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. "We understand what has happened better than anyone," she said. "We understand it with our pockets."</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Inevitably, there were handshakes and smiles all around today in New York as the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V.

They are trying to insure that Russia's intervention, and its efforts to get the United Nations oil embargo on Iraq lifted after a six-month "trial period," do not get in the way of Washington's policy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Clinton Administration said today that it would introduce a Security Council resolution next week calling for the automatic lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government in six months.</p> <p>The move is an opening maneuver in what are likely to be delicate negotiations with Russia, Britain, France and Germany, who have been working with the United States in a so-called "contact group" on Bosnian peace.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The Ukrainian Parliament put aside its longstanding reservations and voted overwhelmingly today to make their nation nuclear-free, removing roadblocks to carrying out two major arms control agreements.</p> <p>In a move that the United States eagerly sought for some time, the Parliament agreed to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which pledges its signers, with the exception of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to rid themselves of all nuclear weapons.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Aid to Russia, always a contentious issue before Congress, is under siege by the new Republican majority, even though President Clinton has already cut Russian aid sharply from last year.</p> <p>The two Republican Senators who are expected to be the most influential voices on foreign assistance -- Jesse Helms of North Carolina, in line to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is likely to run the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Operations -- have repeatedly suggested that aid to Russia is too generous and vow to take an even tougher line next year.</p>
['news and news media', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Buttoned grimly into a suit for his visit to America, the Russian nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky insisted that all those nasty things people said about him just were not true.</p> <p>He was not an anti-Semite, the head of the ultranationalist party that shocked American leaders by capturing the biggest share of parliamentary seats in elections last December told a somewhat incredulous audience of the World Affairs Council of Northern California Monday night.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>A Republican-dominated Congress in Washington is expected to create new strains in the Russian-American relationship, which is already showing stress as Boris N. Yeltsin's Government moves toward a more centrist, nationalist position at home and abroad.</p> <p>The shift in Mr. Yeltsin's stance has been due in large part to his own legislative opposition, which has taken strong nationalist stands on Bosnia, Iraq, NATO and other issues of concern to Washington.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After 10 days of fevered speculation about the state of relations between the United States and a more nationalist Russia, American officials said today that "a lot of air has been cleared" and that "the relationship is in pretty good shape."</p> <p>Vice President Al Gore, after three days of talks with the Russian Prime Minister and a morning meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, was upbeat.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Russian troops continued to bomb the capital of the rebellious Chechnya republic today as President Boris N. Yeltsin struggled to explain his handling of the conflict. i</p> <p>"The President is studying the situation around Chechnya in detail as well as the reaction by the public, by parliamentary deputies and by the news media," his office said in a statement.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's veto of a United Nations resolution on the Balkan war on Friday night was a sharp reminder that Moscow insists on playing a major role in defining the post-cold-war security order.</p> <p>It was only the second time that Russia used its veto power in the Security Council since the collapse of the Soviet Union three years ago, and it was the first such veto since the war in the former Yugoslavia began.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>During the cold war, one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most important jobs was to estimate the Soviet Union's military strength and strategy and share the findings in top-secret reports to the President and selected policy makers.</p> <p>The reports, known as National Intelligence Estimates, are milestones of the arms race, snapshots that chronicled the buildup of nuclear arms as the two superpowers sought peace through ever bigger and more destructive weapons. But with the country they analyzed no longer in existence and the C.I.A. experimenting with a policy of more openness, 80 of those reports from the 1950's through the 1980's were declassified this weekend at Harvard University here during a conference of spies and scholars.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>This two-street town has always been barren. Just a mile from the border with Chechnya, it has a mosque, a couple of barns and about 30 mud-and-wattle huts.</p> <p>Until two weeks ago, 300 Dagestani peasants lived here in the bleak flatlands east of Grozny, the capital of the secessionist Chechen republic.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>In the heart of one of the former Soviet Union's largest missile factories, rocket scientists who once built nuclear weapons aimed at the United States are destroying them with the help of Americans.</p> <p>In the main building, a dilapidated brick structure where the portraits of pioneering Soviet space scientists hang like solemn deities, American defense contractors are working alongside Ukrainian engineers to build a new plant that will vaporize the last drops of fuel from SS-19 missiles.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>Facing growing public opposition to the war in secessionist Chechnya, President Boris N. Yeltsin said on television tonight that he intended to press forward to seize the rebel capital but that he had ordered a halt to the bombing of civilians there.</p> <p>It was the first time Mr. Yeltsin, who sent tanks and thousands of troops to Chechnya on Dec. 11, spoke up publicly to justify his actions. It was also the first time the Russian Government has admitted attacking civilians in the secessionist republic.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'immigration and refugees']	<p>Russian troops are still laying siege to Grozny, the capital of secessionist Chechnya, while in Moscow, opponents of the offensive are laying siege to the presidency of Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>And with his popularity in free fall, Mr. Yeltsin took a cautious step in the direction of those who felt most betrayed by his military offensive.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev will meet soon, perhaps within the next few weeks, in an effort to ease strains in Russian-American relations, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>Mr. Kozyrev and Mr. Christopher discussed the need to review relations between their two countries after a fiery speech by President Boris N. Yeltsin in Budapest on Monday. In the speech to a 52-nation summit meeting to strengthen security throughout Europe Mr. Yeltsin accused NATO of trying to split Europe with its plans to move toward admitting new members and said the United States should not be allowed to dominate the world.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Chechen crisis in Russia embroils a mutinous people rebelling against more than a century of domination by governments in Moscow, a contest given wider significance by the enormous potential riches embedded in the oilfields of the Caucasus.</p> <p>Academic experts and diplomats said yesterday that the Russian Army would almost certainly gain the upper hand over the insurgents, who in the opinion of one expert "might be considered to be the same sort of overwhelmed indigenous people as American Indians."</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The nuclear material recently seized by Czech authorities may be the largest supply of bomb-grade uranium smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, American officials said today. But the officials said that Washington was still awaiting scientific confirmation that the material seized was weapons-grade.</p> <p>According to a preliminary assessment by Prague's Interior Ministry, the shipment confiscated involves 6.6 pounds of highly-enriched uranium 235, which is suitable for making bombs. The nuclear material is believed to have originated in the former Soviet Union.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Republican leaders in Congress are planning a tough new approach that treats foreign aid much like welfare: as a multibillion-dollar handout that needs to be overhauled and cut.</p> <p>In mapping strategy for the foreign aid budget, which is $13.7 billion this year, the Congressional Republicans want to focus on advancing the United States' national security and economic interests rather than what they say is an entitlement program for poor nations. Many of them talk about using their new majority to cut foreign aid by 15 to 20 percent.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Former President Jimmy Carter stepped into the war-torn vestiges of Sarajevo today, proclaiming that Bosnia was a "fine country" but saying nothing to suggest that he could resolve its deep divisions.</p> <p>After 32 months of a war that has scarred Europe, Mr. Carter's visit indicated a new level of American involvement to end the conflict. But his arrival came on a day in which a mortar fired from Serbian positions hit the Holiday Inn, home to many journalists and diplomats, and sniper fire wounded a French United Nations soldier outside the hotel.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Chechens are a bunch of born hoodlums and religious fanatics. Their criminal clans are running an island of banditry within the Russian Federation. Their gross national product is stolen goods. What's more, they were on the side of the Nazis in World War II.</p> <p>That's what Moscow wants the world to believe, as the Red Army moves to crush the secession of Chechnya, a republic of a million fiercely independent Muslims.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Aleksandr Shevchenko, 75, said he was taking a walk this morning after spending the night in his cellar when the air raid began.</p> <p>"I heard and saw it," he said. "It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying," he added, his body shaking at the memory of the first daylight raid on Grozny since the beginning of the Russian offensive against this secessionist capital.</p>
['public opinion']	<p>Russians don't tie yellow ribbons to trees to signal their support of their soldiers fighting in the rebellious region called Chechnya. They don't paste bumper stickers to their cars to protest the bombing there.</p> <p>But here, only 30 miles from Moscow, support for the use of force seems greater than in the capital, where less than 30 percent of people surveyed favored military action.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Racheting up the likelihood of war in the Caucasus and political division at home, President Boris N. Yeltsin today ordered troops to seal the borders and air space of the secessionist republic of Chechnya.</p> <p>While Russian bombers pummeled the outskirts of the republic's capital, Grozny, columns of tanks and thousands of Russian troops were sent to the mostly Muslim region, which has been trying to wrench itself from Russia for more than three years.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration directly criticized Russia's handling of the Chechnya crisis for the first time today, warning Moscow to stop its attacks against Chechen civilians.</p> <p>The warning reflected growing concern that indiscriminate Russian bombing of civilian areas of Grozny, the Chechen capital, is undermining the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin and exposing the Clinton Administration to the charge that its support of Russia's actions in the breakaway republic shows indifference to the lives of Chechen civilians.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>A company whose chairman was once the Secretary of Defense teamed up with a Canadian arms dealer and some enterprising officials in the former Soviet republic of Belarus in a most unusual arms deal, financed in secret by the Pentagon.</p> <p>The deal came to light when the sun rose on Monday morning on a huge Russian-made transport plane parked within sight of an interstate highway in Huntsville, Ala. Its cargo: components of the S-300, the Russian equivalent of the Patriot missile defense system. The buyer: the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's chief military intelligence branch.</p>
['television', 'news and news media']	<p>Wounded soldiers being interviewed in field hospitals. Bloody corpses being pulled from a shot-down helicopter. Russian officers refusing to advance.  Baby-faced boys digging trenches in the snow. Women begging Russian soldiers not to kill their children or cursing the Russian President for trying to stamp out their independence.</p> <p>This is Russia's first opportunity to watch a real war as it happens on officially uncensored Russian television. Those are the images the public is seeing of the Russian offensive against separatists in Chechnya, and they are not making the Russian Government very happy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Cajoled by former President Jimmy Carter, the Bosnian Serbs today offered a four-month cease-fire in Bosnia and agreed to open peace negotiations based on an international plan they rejected in July.</p> <p>After more than eight hours of talks, during which Mr. Carter suggested the Serbs had been misunderstood by people in the United States, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said that new American interpretations of the international peace plan had transformed it into "a basis for further development."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Military chiefs of European countries contributing to the United Nations force in Bosnia began two days of discussions here today with American and Russian officials on how to improve the force's ability to protect civilians from the fighting.</p> <p>American officials said that Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, presented a long list of measures to make the force better able to withstand military pressure from the Bosnian Serbs and other parties to the conflict.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Russian deadline for the rebellious Chechnya region to disarm its soldiers and recognize Russian sovereignty passed this morning with last-minute efforts by the Chechen leadership to forestall an attack on the capital.</p> <p>The Russian Government had vowed on Saturday that its troops would "restore order" in Chechnya -- and if necessary bomb the capital, Grozny -- if rebel forces did not lay down their arms by midnight (4 P.M. Eastern time).</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The people of Grozny were ready for war again. Surrounded by Russian troops for a week, the city had no more hot water, few phone lines and only scarce heat and electricity, but residents seemed in no mood for compromise.</p> <p>Chechens have been sneering at Russia and its ultimatums for 300 years. They were proud of their outlaw status when they were stealing Cossack horses, and many are proud now, when the commodities from the north have become Volvos and machine guns.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia's armed invasion of Chechnya, the small, fierce Caucasian state that declared independence three years ago, will make this week's visits to Moscow of Vice President Al Gore and Defense Secretary William Perry that much more difficult and delicate.</p> <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Perry will inevitably try to restore a sense of comity and momentum to a Russian-American relationship that to Washington, at least, suddenly seems to have lost its spark. Similarly, Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev to "clear the air" after sharp Russian opposition last week to American policy on issues like NATO enlargement, Bosnia and Iraq.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Responding to Russian complaints of rude treatment by consular officers at the American Embassy here, Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said today that he had taken steps to improve the visa application process.</p> <p>Mr. Pickering said he had brought in specialists to monitor the "comportment and deportment" of officers as they conducted interviews, as well as Russian-language experts to study their "use of language."</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and the heads of three former republics of the Soviet Union exchanged documents today that allow the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the first arms control agreement intended to reduce strategic nuclear weapons, to come into force.</p> <p>The arms control treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow in 1991, had been delayed from going into effect because of the reluctance of Ukraine to renounce the nuclear weapons it inherited at the break up of the Soviet Union.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>A 52-nation summit meeting to strengthen security throughout Europe was disrupted today by Russia's opposition to the expansion of NATO and Bosnia's recriminations about the world's failure to end the war in the Balkans.</p> <p>In caustic tones reminiscent of the cold war, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia bluntly told other world leaders in this former Communist capital that NATO was trying to split Europe with its plan to admit members from the former Warsaw Pact and that the United States should not be allowed to dominate the world.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, the flamboyant leader of the breakaway Chechen region, was the first Chechen in the history of the Soviet Union to become a general, commanding a strategic bomber wing at the age of 36.</p> <p>It was a remarkable rise for a boy whose family was deported in 1944, the year of his birth, to far-off Kazakhstan, along with almost the entire population of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous District. Stalin thought they might collaborate with the Nazis to win independence, and given the long history of enmity between the Chechens and the Russians who colonized them, he might have been right.</p>
['television', 'news and news media']	<p>Making clear its intention to continue an offensive in Chechnya despite domestic and foreign criticism, Russia's National Security Council met here today as the army unleashed its most powerful artillery barrage yet on the capital of the secessionist southern region.</p> <p>As Russian forces pummeled the rebel capital, Grozny, with shells from artillery positioned in several nearby villages, President Boris N. Yeltsin vowed yet again to rein in the furious attack.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States and Russia talked past each other today.</p> <p>In intense meetings aimed at repairing the deteriorating relationship between their countries, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev could not agree on how to resolve Russia's war in the rebel region of Chechnya or how to bridge the gaps on other issues.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Which great power is more unsta ble today China or Russia?</p> <p>The quick answer, of course, is Russia. The elected leader, Boris Yeltsin, is besieged in Moscow after his bloody siege of Grozny, capital of the Connecticut-sized breakaway republic of Chechnya.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries.</p> <p>For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The way Secretary of State Warren Christopher and most of his foreign policy team see it, there is a bad Andrei V. Kozyrev and a good Andrei V. Kozyrev.</p> <p>The bad Foreign Minister of Russia is a master grandstander who is quick to pull attention-getting stunts, score rhetorical points and play to the audience back home.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>In a further sign of growing dissatisfaction with how the divided and demoralized Russian military has handled the military offensive in Chechnya, President Boris N. Yeltsin was reported today to be considering taking over direct control of Russia's armed forces.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin was said to be planning to remove the Russian General Staff from the control of the Defense Ministry and have it report directly to him. The biggest loser in such a radical reorganization could be Mr. Yeltsin's politically embattled Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, who is widely blamed for bungling the Chechen operation.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The embattled president of the secessionist Chechen region met with reporters today for the first time in three weeks, to urge talks with Russian Government leaders on a peaceful end to the war and concede that Chechnya could not win a war with Russia.</p> <p>As Russian troops pressed ever closer to his presidential palace in central Grozny, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, the Chechen leader, did not exclude some kind of negotiated autonomy within the Russian Federation for Chechnya and said that "everything can be settled in an hour."</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After weeks of saying Russia's assault against Chechnya was strictly an internal matter, the Clinton Administration accused Moscow today of violating international agreements by failing to notify other countries about its large-scale troop movements into Chechnya.</p> <p>In its strongest criticism of Moscow's actions in Chechnya, the State Department said that in sending 40,000 troops there, Russia flouted an agreement in which European countries have pledged to notify the others whenever they move more than 9,000 troops or more than 250 tanks.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia's Foreign Minister assured Secretary of State Warren Christopher of his country's commitment to democracy and market reform and its determination to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chechnya, but did not say what concrete steps his country intended to take, senior Administration officials said tonight.</p> <p>The sweeping but vague assurances by Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev came during a three-hour dinner with Mr. Christopher that opened two days of intense discussions to repair a relationship between the two countries that was declining even before Russia's military offensive in the breakaway region of Chechnya.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>As Russian troops enter the bombed-out center of Grozny, the capital of the breakaway Chechen republic, this has inescapably become Boris Yeltsin's war. It has gravely stained his presidency and damaged his reputation, and with elections scheduled 18 months from now, he is increasingly seen as a lame duck.</p> <p>If Mr. Yeltsin's nose operation on the eve of the invasion, Dec. 10, was an effort to hide from direct responsibility for Chechnya -- or, as some liberal democrats here suggest, without any evidence, the Russian President was pushed into war unwittingly -- he has identified himself with it now. And it is not too soon to look at the likely aftermath.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>There were reports today of a respite in the bombing of the embattled capital of Chechnya, as ordered by Boris N. Yeltsin. But it brought no reprieve to the Russian President, who remains under attack at home and abroad for his military offensive against the secessionist southern region.</p> <p>Western press reports from Grozny, the rebel capital, supported Russia's claim that bombing was limited to the outskirts of town, but Russian reports contradicted it.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In a decision that could hasten needed loans to Russia, the Government has bowed halfway to foreign pressure and agreed to start liberalizing the domestic oil market.</p> <p>A decree, signed by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin but not yet published, eliminates the requirement that oil companies sell more than half their production at artificially depressed domestic prices, World Bank officials said. The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United States all lobbied vigorously for such a step.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>A month ago, Sergei A. Kovalyov was almost a forgotten man. When Mr. Kovalyov, once a Soviet dissident, picketed the American Embassy in November to protest the denial of a visa for a friend, the embassy's consular officers didn't recognize his name.</p> <p>A biologist who spent years in Soviet labor camps, Mr. Kovalyov was a close ally of Andrei D. Sakharov in the Soviet era and was elected to the new Russian Parliament as a supporter of President Boris N. Yeltsin following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>With double-digit monthly inflation, the Chechnya war and some bizarre personnel appointments, Russia has dug itself a pretty deep hole with Western Governments and the International Monetary Fund, which is now debating a $6 billion loan Moscow is counting on.</p> <p>The length and brutality of the Chechnya war, which is not over, have damaged Russia's reputation in the West and undermined political and economic stability here. And the 1995 budget, which has just passed its second reading in Parliament, is based on outdated assumptions and has a big deficit that Moscow is counting on Western financing to fill.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In ancient times, sailors lost at sea would sometimes encounter mythical sirens, scary temptresses like Lorelei or Circe who lured and destroyed men. Perhaps the first sign that Russia's leaders were suffering from strain was when they began insisting that female snipers from the Baltics were stalking Russian soldiers in war-torn Chechnya.</p> <p>Newspapers are using the term "Smutnaya Vremya," or Time of Troubles, to describe Russia's state of mind. The phrase usually refers to the social and political chaos that arose from a schism in the 17th-century Russian Orthodox Church. From talk of sinister right-wing plots, to rumors of poisoned vodka sent from Chechnya, to a tabloid report that the stress of war has caused a mutation in the Russian gene pool, the country is a bundle of nerves.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>In the most recent poll of Russian voters, Grigory Yavlinsky -- his name means "The Man Who Appears" -- now draws more support for president than Boris Yeltsin.</p> <p>That says less about the growing strength of the 42-year-old economist from Lvov, head of a reformist bloc in Parliament, than it does about the collapse of public backing for the president who ordered 60,000 troops to wipe out a few thousand secessionaries in Chechnya.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The city of Grozny is gone now. There are still roads, but they are marked by bomb craters, and there are buildings standing, but they are in flames. There are landmarks and street signs and dogs and burnt trees. There are even people, but they risk their lives each time they emerge from their basement shelters for a sip of muddy water.</p> <p>After seven weeks of war between Russia and the breakaway region of Chechnya, this is no longer a city.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Two years ago, the Russian Foreign Minister horrified a gathering of 53 European countries in Stockholm by announcing what he called "a correction in the course of Russian foreign policy."</p> <p>Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev warned that Russia saw a threat in overtures by NATO to formerly Communist countries in Eastern Europe, and in Western hostility to the Serbs in the war in Bosnia. Moscow, he said, had a right to intervene militarily in what he called the "post-imperial space" around it, and would not hesitate to exercise it.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The war for Chechnya has turned into a vicious block-by-block street brawl. After the capital had been pounded from the skies for days, teams of Russian snipers entered central buildings in Grozny today and fired on Chechen soldiers throughout the day.</p> <p>Casualties were said to be heavy on both sides as the badly outnumbered Chechen soldiers fought back ferociously, but there was no reliable accounting of casualties on either side. The hulks of several Russian tanks -- some with troops still in them -- smoldered near the central train station, where much of the heaviest fighting has taken place.</p>
['religion and churches', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Under criticism at home and abroad for Russia's military offensive in the secessionist region of Chechnya, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced today that he had ordered a halt in the aerial bombing of Grozny, the rebel capital.</p> <p>The order, which was to take effect at midnight, did not apply to artillery or rocket launchers, which continue to pound the city. Mr. Yeltsin's press office said the decision was "guided by the desire to prevent an increase in the number of victims among the civilian population."</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Though increasingly isolated, life at the top for Boris N. Yeltsin may not be all that lonely. The Russian President has rid himself of scores of advisers and confidants over the last few years, but he still has at least one man always at his side: the chief of presidential security, Aleksandr A. Korzhakov, a former K.G.B. major who has been his bodyguard since 1985.</p> <p>Tennis partner, drinking companion, political hatchet man, Mr. Korzhakov, 44, is increasingly perceived by some Russians to have the kind of access and bent for power that characterized the role of Rasputin, the zealous monk who haunted the court of the last Czar.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Under fire for strongly backing President Boris N. Yeltsin during the Chechnya crisis, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced a modest change today in policy, warning Mr. Yeltsin that he could lose Washington's support if he forsakes democracy or free markets.</p> <p>Mr. Christopher seemed to put new conditions on American support for the Russian leader. Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," he said, "Our concern is for reform in Russia. We'll continue to support President Yeltsin as long as he is moving in the right direction."</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Several billion barrels of oil under the Caspian Sea lie waiting to be tapped off the stony coast of this former Soviet republic. No technical difficulties preclude a daily oil output that could eventually be equal to a tenth of what is produced each day in the United States.</p> <p>But a Western-led consortium that is spending $7 billion to develop the huge new oilfields has found itself frustrated by the political realities of a region of Central Asia where Russia, Iran, Turkey and the West have historically competed for influence.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'atomic energy']	<p>China said today that the United States "will increase the danger of nuclear war" and "trigger an arms race in outer space" if it proceeds with a plan to develop an advanced missile defense system that could be deployed around United States forces in Asia.</p> <p>A proposal to build a missile shield covering the United States -- reminiscent of the "Star Wars" program of the Reagan years -- was defeated on Thursday in the House of Representatives. But the Clinton Administration and some members of Congress support the development of a smaller "theater missile defense" system to protect American forces and allies when they are exposed to shorter-range missiles like those Iraq fired against Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, came out in favor of ratifying the Start-2 arms reduction treaty this week, thereby removing what the Administration had feared could be one of the biggest roadblocks to its quick approval.</p> <p>Administration officials had worried that Mr. Helms, who has opposed many treaties, would use his power as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to delay Start-2.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>The Administration accused Russia today of human rights abuses, saying Moscow had violated international agreements when it sent troops into Chechnya, the secessionist republic, to attack civilians.</p> <p>It also accused Russia of making arbitrary arrests, beating prisoners and allowing military recruits to be abused in systematic hazing.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Administration is struggling to resolve differences with Russia while leading Republicans threaten to withhold aid unless Moscow cancels a nuclear energy deal with Iran.</p> <p>In recent days, a number of Republicans in Congress have said that Russia's $1 billion deal to build four nuclear reactors would speed Iran's quest for nuclear weapons and that they were prepared to use aid as a weapon to stop it.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Frustrated by the lack of progress in Middle East peace talks, the P.L.O.  leader, Yasir Arafat, called for United States intervention today to rescue his negotiations with Israel from stalemate.</p> <p>Mr. Arafat, who heads the Palestinian self-rule authority in the Gaza Strip, made a similar appeal to Russia and Norway, both of which have been brokers in getting the long-struggling enemies to talk to one another.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Vyacheslav and Tatyana Shapkin, Russians born in Kazakhstan, have had enough. The state collective farm where they live, 62 miles north of here, has not paid them in six months. They are selling everything they own.</p> <p>They are doing what 300,000 other ethnic Russians in Kazakhstan did in 1994; they are moving back to a Russia they barely know.</p>
['space', 'russia-international relations-us', 'space stations']	<p>The space shuttle Discovery, its leaky thruster turned off, flew to a close rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir yesterday as both craft hurtled above Earth at more than 17,000 miles an hour. Their tense meeting was the first significant step in a multibillion-dollar venture to turn former foes into partners in the biggest collaborative science project ever.</p> <p>With nine astronauts chattering away in English and Russian, six on the Discovery and three on Mir, the 122-foot-long shuttle slowly came within about 40 feet of the 108-foot Russian outpost at 2:20 P.M. and held that position for a few minutes in a rehearsal for the first shuttle-station linkup, scheduled for June.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Russian and Chechen commanders agreed today on a cease-fire and an exchange of prisoners in the civil war in Chechnya, with more talks scheduled for Wednesday, the day before the Russian President makes an important speech to Parliament.</p> <p>The overall Russian commander, Col. Gen. Anatoly Kulikov of the Interior Ministry forces, met for five hours today with the Chechen chief of staff, Col. Aslan Maskhadov, at the airport in the small town of Sleptsovsk, in Ingushetia. The Russian Army commander, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, and the Ingush Vice President, Boris Agapov, also attended the talks.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton appealed personally to President Boris N. Yeltsin for the first time today in urging the Russian leader to find a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Chechnya.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton had previously appealed to Mr. Yeltsin in writing, and the President has publicly urged an end to the fighting in Russia's secessionist region. But White House officials said Mr. Clinton expressed that message in person today after telephoning Mr. Yeltsin for the first time since Russian forces invaded Chechnya in December.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'foreign aid', 'war and revolution']	<p>For some Americans who played a part in their country's long and expensive involvement in Afghanistan, the clamor of the war widows and the one-legged boys and the weakened old men who gathered on a rocky hillside above this shattered capital today seemed like a requiem for broken hopes.</p> <p>"Amerika khub!" -- meaning "America is good!" -- the crowd cried in a bittersweet chorus in Dari, the Afghan dialect of Persian.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'freedom and human rights', 'war and revolution']	<p>As Russian forces intensified attacks on rebel troops in Chechnya today, a startling preliminary report by the President's commission on human rights suggested that as many as 24,400 civilians have died since the bloody war in the separatist republic began on Dec. 11.</p> <p>But the figure -- so high that the researcher who came up with it likened the Chechen conflict to the slaughter of Polish civilians during World War II -- was questioned even by the head of the human rights commission, Sergei A. Kovalyov.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany today criticized Russia's assault on Chechnya but said it was nonetheless vital to continue supporting President Boris N. Yeltsin, warning that anti-democratic forces could take power in Moscow if the West abandoned him.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kohl -- the two Western leaders who are closest to Mr. Yeltsin -- faulted Russia for using such heavy force and urged it to end the war in the breakaway region of Chechnya as quickly as possible even as they gave the Russian leader their strongest embrace since Moscow first attacked Chechnya in December.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>A quick insight to illuminate the political landscape: China, Russia and the United States -- all in their own ways -- are sending power long concentrated in their capital cities out to the boondocks.</p> <p>Curiously, when Americans see this happening in China, we tut-tut about "warlordism." After Beijing-centric Deng dies, political power in China will probably devolve to centrifugalmen in a half-dozen regions, thereby reflecting economic reality.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin today defended the offensive in Chechnya before some of his harshest critics in Parliament, but blamed the army leadership for being unprepared and thus responsible for the heavy casualties.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, in his first lengthy public statement since ordering troops into Chechnya in December, spoke clearly and seemed robust during the hourlong speech. But he named no names, dismissed no commanders for their "failures, setbacks and mistakes in command" and said he would draw no rash judgments. His aides said he would deliver another address on army reform later, perhaps in two months' time.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>White House officials said today that President Clinton does not intend to accept an invitation to visit Moscow in May for a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, and the Administration called the war in Chechnya an impediment in Russian-American relations.</p> <p>The White House aides cited the Chechen war as the main reason that Mr. Clinton wanted to put off the meeting, which was to have coincided with Russian ceremonies celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory over Nazi Germany. But they said a second important reason was the President's reluctance to embark on yet another round of World War II commemorations abroad when he believes it would be more fitting to celebrate V-E Day at home.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>In two days of talks here, the United States and Russia have made no progress in narrowing their differences over Moscow's plans to build four nuclear reactors in Iran, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>The Administration vigorously protested the contract during a two-day visit by Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Georgi Mamedov. Republicans in Congress are threatening to cut off aid to Moscow unless it cancels the project, which American officials fear will speed Iran's efforts to build nuclear arms.</p>
['energy and power']	<p>Luckily for Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, he was in Geneva on Thursday trying to show, in talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, that Russia was still a superpower.</p> <p>Mr. Kozyrev was lucky not to be in Moscow that day because the Moscow regional electrical authority cut power to many of the elevators -- including those used exclusively by Mr. Kozyrev and his principal deputies -- in the enormous, gothic Foreign Ministry building that towers over Smolenskaya Square in central Moscow.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Eager to reduce Russia's opposition to expanding NATO, President Clinton is planning to exchange letters with President Boris N. Yeltsin to assure him that NATO no longer is an anti-Russian alliance, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>Administration officials said they were going out of their way to make Mr. Yeltsin feel comfortable about the extension of NATO into Eastern Europe in hopes of easing tensions that have developed not only over NATO but also over Russia's offensive in the breakaway region of Chechnya and Moscow's plans to build nuclear reactors in Iran.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>After more than two months of shifting signals, the White House announced today that President Clinton would travel to Moscow in May to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin and to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe.</p> <p>The meeting, which was proposed by Mr. Yeltsin in January, has become the subject of the kind of debate in Washington that used to be reserved for the summit-planning decisions of the cold war.</p>
['war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a fresh effort to persuade President Clinton to come to Moscow for the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would tailor the Red Square military parade on May 9 to avoid embarrassing the American leader.</p> <p>"He wants to come," Mr. Yeltsin said of Mr. Clinton, but is "a bit concerned about the whole scenario." He said that to make it easier for Mr. Clinton to come for the celebration, the parade in Red Square would be limited to veterans of World War II and no military equipment would be included.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Vigorous, opinionated and deeply frustrated, the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union floats across the political landscape like a restless ghost, unable to make his presence felt.</p> <p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev's name is not even mentioned in most surveys of voters' favorite politicians. He complains that national television declines his requests for air time.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid']	<p>In another gesture to Western opinion, President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to allow a human-rights mission from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe to maintain a presence in the secessionist Chechnya republic.</p> <p>Meeting the Foreign Ministers of Germany, France and Spain, who came here on a mission from the European Union, Mr. Yeltsin repeated his assurances that Russia is committed to a political settlement of the three-month Chechnya war.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>With great fanfare last spring, the United States, Russia, France, Britain and Germany formed the so-called contact group, confident that their collective diplomatic might would enable them to press Bosnia's warring factions to make peace.</p> <p>A year has passed, and not only does peace in Bosnia seem as elusive as ever, but many diplomats also say the contact group is on the brink of falling apart. Nowadays, the five major powers seem to spend more energy quarreling among themselves about Bosnia than exerting pressure on the Muslims, Serbs and Croats.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>It was just one line in an otherwise unremarkable meeting on Monday, but it surprised the officials in the room: Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggested that the West should begin to think about a Russia without Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>Mr. Christopher's declaration came in response to a question by Italy's Foreign Minister, Susanna Agnelli, who expressed concern about the Russian President's leadership. She bluntly asked Mr. Christopher whether the West should "go on supporting" him, according to participants in the meeting.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>After three months of squabbling over the war in Chechnya, the expansion of NATO and the plans by Moscow to build nuclear reactors in Iran, Russia's Foreign Minister stated the obvious last week when he said the post-cold-war honeymoon between Russia and the United States "has come to an end."</p> <p>With President Clinton now planning to meet in May with President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and Secretary of State Warren Christopher suggested that relations between the two countries should evolve into something new and utterly unromantic.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Bibi Gul is a 35-year-old widow who lost her husband, a driver, when an artillery shell hit their home in the southern suburbs of Kabul last year. She has no job, and five children under the age of 6. They share an unheated upper room with 10 other people, sleeping on mats spread out on the bare concrete floor.</p> <p>At lunchtime the other day, Mrs. Gul had other indignities on her mind. From shortly after dawn, she had been out begging, part of an army of indigent war widows who are a common sight in most villages and towns in Afghanistan.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>The pugnacious yet immensely popular Mayor of Moscow abruptly threatened to resign today unless President Boris N. Yeltsin reinstates two senior law enforcement officials he dismissed after the mob-style execution of the television personality Vladislav Listyev.</p> <p>The Mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, who was once one of Mr. Yeltsin's most trusted supporters, said the dismissal of the city's chief prosecutor, Gennadi Ponomaryov, and police chief, Vladimir Pankratov, on Monday was a thinly veiled attack on him. Many in Moscow agree, including some of Mr. Luzhkov's most powerful friends, who say he was completely serious about leaving his job.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, lashed out against Boris N. Yeltsin today, likening the Clinton Administration's embrace of the Russian leader to the Bush Administration's refusal to abandon his predecessor, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p> <p>The remarks by Mr. Dole, a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination, reflect a growing frustration with Mr. Yeltsin by Republicans and Democrats in Congress, and even by the Administration.</p>
['war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The accommodationists in charge of Clinton foreign policy put on a show of internal agonizing about whether to celebrate the golden anniversary of V-E Day in Moscow.</p> <p>A visit by a U.S. President is eagerly sought by foreign leaders. President Nixon bombed Haiphong and mined its harbor confident that Leonid Brezhnev would not let that action interfere with an upcoming Moscow summit. Contrary to the dire predictions of dovish commentators, Nixon's provocative escalation did not stop the Moscow meeting.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned Russia today that its military intervention in Chechnya could delay its efforts to win quick integration into the West.</p> <p>Describing Russia's invasion of Chechnya as "foolhardy" and "tragically wrong," Mr. Christopher said its actions there had badly hurt Russia's image overseas and could frustrate Moscow's desire to gain full participation in several international groups, including the Group of Seven industrial nations.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Four of the world's main nuclear countries are locked in a dispute as they negotiate a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing: they all want to retain the right to conduct tiny blasts but disagree over the size that should be permitted.</p> <p>The conflict stems from the little-known fact that arms designers can set off nuclear explosions that at their smallest are the equivalent of only a few pounds of TNT. The blasts are useful in checking design calculations and the reliability of existing weapons.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The man installed by Moscow as the leader of a new, interim government for the rebellious Chechen region is a soft-spoken technocrat who understands that his efforts to restore a semblance of normal life to this war-smashed city may sign his death warrant.</p> <p>"I'm here because someone must do this dirty work," the official, Salambek Khadzhiyev, said in an office heavily guarded by Russian troops. "It's a question of conscience, not of desire for power. What was happening in Grozny seemed an awful nightmare. But reality is reality, and the point is not being indignant. We've got to get down to work."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia agreed today to try to extend the fraying cease-fire in Bosnia and American officials disclosed details of a revised peace plan that would no longer require Serbia to recognize Bosnia formally.</p> <p>Under the plan, Serbia is being asked to approve constitutional principles that would keep Bosnia's territory intact; in return Serbia would win a partial lifting of sanctions.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>New evidence of an Iraqi military buildup has helped the United States beat back an effort to lift United Nations sanctions against Baghdad, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>They said the Clinton Administration had shared intelligence data, including satellite photos, with other Security Council members to show that President Saddam Hussein has been rebuilding factories that could produce chemical weapons or missiles, and integrating stolen Kuwaiti missiles and armored vehicles into the Iraqi Army.</p>
['television', 'crime and criminals']	<p>The gangland-style murder this week of a prominent television journalist and executive, Vladislav Listyev, is a tragic but important sign of the rapid development of Russian television. Big new money and markets have attracted graft and crime, but they are also creating a pluralism that undermines the strict control of the state.</p> <p>In the last two years, the once-firm grip over television broadcasts by the central Government has been significantly weakened by the creation of privately owned and relatively independent networks like NTV, or Independent Television, and TV6 Moscow.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>With relations between Washington and Moscow at their worst since before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia today staged a dress rehearsal for the summit meeting between their Presidents next month in Moscow.</p> <p>There are no illusions inside the Administration that President Clinton will move President Boris N. Yeltsin from his fixed positions on a variety of issues. Mr. Christopher has said that the talks in Moscow will be businesslike, which in diplomatic code means no breakthroughs are expected.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances']	<p>IS Russia poised for economic takeoff? After three years of on-again, off-again reforms and with the Pyrrhic military victory in Chechnya still fresh in the news, skepticism comes easily. But little by little, wary analysts are abandoning their caution. "Russia is a real market economy now," says Andrei Shleifer, an economist at Harvard who has advised the Russian Government on privatization.</p> <p>That doesn't mean the path to affluence is strewn with rose petals. A big test of Moscow's political will to contain inflation looms this summer, when the 30 million Russians who still scratch a living from the soil demand a budget-busting round of subsidies to finance the harvest. The more fundamental challenge -- one the Government will no doubt face for years to come -- is the taming of the private cartels that are replacing public monopolies. "You can't sustain an efficient, continent-wide economy with concentrated economic power," argues Donald W. Green, managing director of Planecon, a Washington-based consulting firm.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic energy', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The United States failed yesterday to persuade China to end its nuclear cooperation with Iran or to improve its human rights performance, as representatives from 174 countries gathered at the United Nations to decide the fate of a treaty that has limited the spread of nuclear weapons for a quarter of a century.</p> <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, discussed their differences in a two-hour meeting and lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel hours before the start of the monthlong conference to extend the 25-year-old nuclear treaty.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration stepped up its criticism of Russia's offensive in Chechnya today, saying the campaign was a major miscalculation that would backfire for the Russians and hurt relations with the United States.</p> <p>In a stinging attack issued less than a month before President Clinton is to visit Moscow, the State Department's new spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said the Administration was alarmed by reports of atrocities against Chechen civilians.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Moscow News columnist Aleksei Pushkov likes to explain the political and economic changes taking place in Russia today through the life of his neighbor: "He was this poor driver who lived in the apartment off the entryway. Every Friday night he would get drunk and sing along, over and over in a very loud voice, to two English songs: 'Happy Nation' and 'All She Wants Is Another Baby.' He had no idea what the words meant. When he got really drunk, he'd start beating his wife and she would start screaming. He was driving us crazy. I wanted to throw a grenade at him.</p> <p>"Anyway, about eight months ago, I don't know how, he got a share in a small car repair shop," continued Mr. Pushkov. "Since then, no more 'Happy Nation,' no more singing all night, no more beating his wife. He leaves every morning at 8:30 for work and he is satisfied. He knows he has some prospects in life now. My wife said to me the other day, 'Hey, look at Happy Nation' -- that's what we call him -- 'he's an owner now.' I think about this guy and ask myself: 'Next year, will he vote for the Communists? No. Will he Vote for Zhirinovsky? No. He will vote for the center.' "</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>After considerable debate in the Kremlin, President Boris N. Yeltsin has decided to stand atop Lenin's Mausoleum in Red Square to review a May 9 parade of World War II veterans, Kremlin officials said today.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, the first popularly elected President in Russian history, will stand where every Communist Party chief has stood before him for state occasions and military parades, his press secretary, Sergei K. Medvedev, said in an interview.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Administration officials disclosed today that Russia's top atomic energy official promised Iran in January that Moscow would sell equipment to Iran that could be used to prepare material suitable for an atomic bomb.</p> <p>The Administration learned three weeks ago about Moscow's commitment and since then, Washington has implored Russia to drop the plan, saying it jeopardizes American economic aid to Russia.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>China, publicly breaking ranks with the other acknowledged nuclear-weapons powers, said today that it could back an extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty for either an indefinite period or a series of fixed periods of no less than 25 years' duration.</p> <p>The other four nuclear-weapons powers -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- are lobbying for an indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which came into force in 1970 and is due for renewal this year. They argue that any other outcome would weaken the treaty.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>An American disaster relief expert and five Russian aid workers have disappeared while on an emergency mission to Chechnya, the breakaway region under attack by Russian troops, the State Department and his friends said today.</p> <p>The expert, Frederick C. Cuny, has worked on emergency relief projects in Biafra, Bosnia, Ethiopia and Somalia. He was last heard from in Chechnya nine days ago.</p>
['medicine and health', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'currency', 'atomic weapons', 'children and youth', 'law and legislation', 'reform and reorganization', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Clinton tonight repeated his vow to oppose the welfare overhaul passed by the House of Representatives as too harsh on children, and called on Congress to pass by the Fourth of July a comprehensive bill that would put the poor to work and provide greater flexibility for states.</p> <p>In his first prime-time news conference in more than eight months, Mr. Clinton also said he was ready 'to go to the mat" for his nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. as Surgeon General despite a warning by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, that he might not bring the nomination up for a vote.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>The Russian military campaign in the secessionist region of Chechnya has been accelerated and become more brutal because of Russia's desire to end visible resistance before world leaders come to Moscow on May 9, some of Russia's most respected human-rights advocates said today.</p> <p>Sergei A. Kovalyov, who remains President Boris N. Yeltsin's human-rights commissioner, said, "By May 9, it must be possible to shrug one's shoulders and say, 'Yes, many things happened in Chechnya and of course we are very sorry about it, but don't worry, the war is over.' "</p>
['news and news media']	<p>The Russian Government has revoked the visa of an American journalist in what may be the first such case since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Steve LeVine, a stringer for Newsweek and The Washington Post, was stopped by immigration officials when he arrived at Vnukovo airport in Moscow on Monday evening from Tbilisi, Georgia, and was informed that his multiple-entry visa had been invalidated. He was not permitted to leave the airport, and spent the night in the airport's lounge before flying back to Tbilisi this morning.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev of Russia delivered a remarkable speech here the other day on Russian foreign policy -- a speech that was at the same time illuminating, troubling and pathetic.</p> <p>What was illuminating about Mr. Kozyrev's address to a U.S.-Japan-Europe conference was that it clarified exactly where the Russian Government stands on the question of NATO expansion.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>In early August 1930, Stalin wrote a routine note to his most loyal comrade in the Soviet leadership, Vyacheslav M. Molotov, with 10 directives. The second one dealt with the hoarding of coins, a problem the Kremlin was trying to deal with.</p> <p>After venting his rage at the State Bank and the Finance Ministry, Stalin wrote, "Definitely shoot two or three dozen wreckers from these apparats, including several dozen common cashiers."</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin struggled today to find common ground in anticipation of their summit meeting next month in Moscow, papering over some disputes, ignoring others, and resolving none of them.</p> <p>Their 30-minute telephone conversation was cordial but vague, underscoring strains between the United States and Russia that American officials made no effort to hide. Senior American officials acknowledged that Mr. Clinton did not even raise the most serious issue dividing Washington and Moscow: Russia's $1 billion deal to build two nuclear energy reactors for Iran, which the United States wants canceled.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>In the broken, post-Chechnya political landscape, a weakened Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President, has moved to try to create a centrist bloc in December's parliamentary elections and to preserve his own options for re-election in June 1996.</p> <p>Having lost the support of the squabbling liberals who were once the backbone of his presidency, Mr. Yeltsin himself has moved to the nationalist center. Now he's trying to get some firmer legislative support behind him and diminish the chance of a new parliament controlled by today's ideological extremes: the ultranationalists like Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and the Communists, with their Agrarian Party partners.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Clinton Administration has taken the unusual step of providing Russian officials with American intelligence on Iran in hopes of persuading them to drop Russia's project to build nuclear reactors in Iran.</p> <p>American officials said the written intelligence report shared with the Russians shows that Iran has a crash program to build nuclear weapons that would be accelerated by Russia's $1 billion contract to build up to four reactors in Iran.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'atomic energy']	<p>Secretary of Defense Perry said today that American aid to Russian military conversion programs should continue, despite the fierce opposition by the United States to the Russian plan to build nuclear reactors for Iran.</p> <p>"We cannot put other programs, which are very, very important to us, at hostage every time we have a disagreement," Mr. Perry said after touring a Russian defense plant in Moscow that is beginning to produce hearing aids in a joint venture agreement with an American company.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'medicine and health', 'war and revolution']	<p>Grozny's Hospital No. 4, one of only three hospitals still open in this city eviscerated by war, is barely functioning, with most of its buildings in ruins.</p> <p>Only a few rooms are open, with four to six beds each, most of them full. An old woman lies awkwardly, her skin swollen and black, while her relatives hover around as in any hospital anywhere, hoping for the best.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Clinton Administration has repeatedly warned Moscow in recent months that unless it cancels a project to build nuclear reactors in Iran, the United States will drop plans for nuclear cooperation that Russia badly wants, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>This past week, Russian officials brushed aside these warnings and insisted that they would go ahead with the reactor project. But Administration officials said they hoped the warnings, together with a growing campaign of pressure and inducements, would persuade Russia to announce plans to cancel the Iranian deal when President Clinton visits Moscow in May.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Russian Government made clear today that it would go ahead with the sale of light-water nuclear reactors to Iran over fierce American protests, repeated here by the visiting Defense Secretary, William J. Perry.</p> <p>Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin shares American concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mr. Perry said in a news conference this evening, and agreed to arrange meetings of Russian and American experts concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons and the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>For a quarter of a century, a relatively simple treaty of fewer than 50 paragraphs has served as the touchstone of all international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons and to prevent peaceful nuclear projects from being used in destructive ways.</p> <p>Now the 1968 accord, the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, is up for renewal, 25 years after it took effect, in 1970.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Two weeks before a summit meeting in Moscow between Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's Foreign Minister today cautioned the Administration and Congress against pursuing plans for a new short-range missile defense system. He said moving ahead with such plans could slow progress on disarmament agreements and undermine a fragile new Russian-American partnership.</p> <p>The missile defense system has been the subject of several recent meetings between the two sides in which American officials have tried to meet some Russian concerns before the summit meeting takes place.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>Gathering in the vibrant capital that has risen from the ruins of the city where Hitler planned his war of aggression, leaders of France, Britain, Russia, the United States and Germany pledged today to prevent a repetition of the European cataclysm that ended on this date 50 years ago.</p> <p>"I believe that for our countries here, it was the last time we will ever fight against each other," said Prime Minister John Major of Britain. "I cannot believe that we will ever revert to the old way of doing things."</p>
['terrorism', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>On an Army parade ground rich with history, President Clinton paid solemn tribute today to the generation that won World War II and prevailed in the cold war, thanking veterans for their sacrifice but warning that the nation still faced "forces of darkness" abroad and at home.</p> <p>"Because of all you did, we live in a moment of hope, in a nation at peace," Mr. Clinton told veterans in a ceremony at Fort Myer, Va.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'taxation', 'reform and reorganization', 'ethics']	<p>Everyone warned me to beware of street crime in Moscow. So my first morning in the hotel I go down to the front desk and ask for a safety deposit box to store my cash. "I'm sorry," says the desk clerk, "they're all being used. There's a waiting list; would you like me to put you down?" A waiting list for safety deposit boxes? It sounded like the punch line to a joke: "How do you know when you're in a really dangerous city?"</p> <p>After a week here, though, I found reports of Moscow street crime a tad exaggerated. I spent a morning riding around in a police car with the Moscow Municipal Militia, an elite unit for fighting street crime. My hosts sounded like cops dealing with the same problems of any major U.S. city, although they did wear flak jackets and carry submachine guns. They arrested some Ukrainians for improper residence permits, sniffed around for drug peddlers and stolen cars, and complained bitterly that the criminals now drove Mercedeses while their little Russian-made Zhiguly had no reverse gear.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After a pitched battle between French peacekeepers and Bosnian Serbs, France and its NATO allies renewed diplomatic efforts today to stop the violence and asked Russia to help persuade the Serbs to free United Nations troops seized as hostages.</p> <p>Although more than 150 French troops were among the 220 surrounded or held as human shields, France did not publicly repeat earlier threats to withdraw its three battalions from Bosnia.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Less than a week before President Clinton's arrival in Moscow to join the 50th anniversary celebrations of V-E Day, relations between the United States and Russia appear to have deteriorated.</p> <p>Russian officials think Washington is overly concerned with less-than-pressing issues like an old contract to sell Russian nuclear reactors to Iran and pressure in Washington to build a new missile defense system. The Russians continue to express skepticism about American intentions to expand NATO, and think that Washington is taking advantage of Moscow's weakened position in the world.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Clinton Administration's foreign policy came under sharp criticism on two fronts in Congress today.</p> <p>Senate Republicans lambasted it for not being tough enough toward Russia, while several House Democrats joined their Republican colleagues in attacking new policies on Cuban immigration.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>At a vast construction site baked by the sun and buffeted by the salty Persian Gulf air, two partly built nuclear reactors are frozen in time.</p> <p>For the Iranians, the enormous steel and concrete structures represent what might have been and what might be, a symbol of their legal right to develop nuclear energy and of their potential to become a great regional power.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Not since the grim old days of the cold war have relations between the United States and Russia been quite as problematic as they are this weekend, on the eve of President Clinton's visit for celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe in World War II.</p> <p>The man on whom Mr. Clinton has counted so heavily, President Boris N. Yeltsin, has been severely weakened at home and abroad by his army's devastating suppression of dissent in Chechnya. No longer Bill and Boris, buddy-buddies, the two leaders have squabbled over NATO expansion, Moscow's plans to sell a nuclear reactor to Iran and the fighting in Bosnia.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>An Iranian official said today that Teheran would not keep spent fuel from Russian-made atomic reactors that could serve as raw material for nuclear bombs, raising the possibility that Teheran and Moscow are trying to make the deal more palatable to the United States.</p> <p>The official, Mohammed Sadegh Ayatollahi, who is Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said in New York today that Iran would return the spent fuel rods to Russia, a move apparently designed to reassure Western countries worried that Iran planned to separate the plutonium for possible use in a nuclear bomb.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The cast of candidates in Kolomna's special election sound more like suspects in a hokey murder mystery than contenders in a political contest.</p> <p>They include Aleksei I. Vedenkin, 30, a flashy, big-spending neo-fascist who threatened to kill liberals in Parliament, and Yelena A. Mavrodi, 25, a glamorous model and wife of a well-known but shady millionaire.  Another is Gherman S. Titov, 70, once the No. 2 Soviet astronaut after Yuri Gagarin. And there is a 24-year-old businessman whose campaign literature features his face next to a huge car key -- a reminder of the Volga sedan grand prize he has promised voters in a lottery based on ballot numbers.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>When Leonid I. Brezhnev was alive and ailing, the Soviet leader entrusted his health and astrological fate to a well-known psychic healer. In the increasingly superstitious Kremlin of President Boris N. Yeltsin, that role is filled by a high-ranking officer of the widely feared presidential security service, who is said to monitor the President's health and horoscopes.</p> <p>While the horoscopes may seem a relatively minor bit of deja vu, there are increasing signs of a return to Soviet-style governance, both in the fears it created and the favors it bestowed.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Bill Clinton represented American interests poorly in Moscow.</p> <p>On the sale of Russian nuclear plants to Iran, he was taken in by -- or participated in -- a trick.</p> <p>One month ago, to create a "concession" to the naive American President, Boris Yeltsin's atomic energy chief upped the ante, letting C.I.A. ears hear him consider adding centrifuges to the deal with Teheran. That outrageous act would be like selling mullahs the means to make a bomb right away, instead of in a few years with nuclear plants alone.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced partial agreements today on aspects of European security and the spread of nuclear weapons, but they remained far apart on the expansion of NATO, Russian nuclear sales to Iran and the war in secessionist Chechnya.</p> <p>After trying for weeks to lower expectations, to the point where officials on both sides predicted no accords would develop, both Presidents emphasized today at the end of their summit meeting that they had achieved something concrete during their three hours of intense discussions.</p>
['elections']	<p>The big question on the table in Moscow this week was not Chechnya or even the sale of nuclear equipment to Iran.</p> <p>It was this: Will Russia cooperate in the establishment of a stable security system for central Europe, where this century's two world wars originated?  Or will it resist the prescription favored by the United States and its allies, the eastward expansion of NATO, sulk if it takes place anyway, and worsen the tensions developing between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin and their Governments?</p>
['atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Seeking to explain a trade ban against Iran, Secretary of State Warren Christopher today portrayed the country as an "outlaw state" that spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on international terrorism and offered what he called proof that Teheran has been trying for a decade to develop nuclear weapons.</p> <p>In briefing reporters, Mr. Christopher also called on America's allies to punish Iran with economic sanctions of their own and expressed hope that the American decision would move Russia and China to renege on their pledges to help Iran build nuclear energy plants.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Speaker of Russia's Parliament met with the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, today and complained that the United States had not provided Russia with millions of dollars in promised economic aid.</p> <p>Ivan P. Rybkin, Speaker of Russia's lower house of Parliament, said he had told Mr. Gingrich that his country had not received all the aid promised to build new housing for Russian troops pulled out of the Baltic states or to decommission more than a dozen Russian nuclear-powered submarines.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Chechnya, NATO expansion and Russian nuclear reactor sales to Iran hang over this week's Russian-American summit meeting as the great irreconcilables. But the prominence and stickiness of the differences stem from the disorganization and confusion of a still-young Russian Government that has no clear delineation of responsibilities.</p> <p>American officials do not always like Russia's new, more assertive and nationalist policies. But they particularly dislike not knowing at any moment what those policies are -- and who speaks legitimately for Russia and President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons']	<p>As President Clinton prepared for summit talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin, Republican leaders warned today of "catastrophic consequences" for United States aid to Russia if Moscow goes ahead with plans to sell nuclear technology to Iran.</p> <p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Russia's insistence on selling Iran light-water nuclear reactors and equipment useful in making bomb-grade material threatened to jeopardize relations between Moscow and Washington.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'children and youth', 'war and revolution']	<p>There is no longer serious doubt about what happened in this squat Chechen farming village early last month. The circumstances are still vague. But the results are not.</p> <p>More than 3,000 Russian soldiers took the town, doused its houses with gasoline and set them on fire, and opened fire on unarmed women, children and elderly people, killing more than 100.</p>
['war and revolution', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>President Clinton and his top advisers know exactly what they would like to get out of next week's meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. The trouble, as the advisers concede, is that they no longer see much chance of getting it.</p> <p>Instead, the White House is portraying the one-day meeting as an endeavor in personal diplomacy. Even after months of American prodding on issues ranging from the war in Chechnya to Russia's nuclear accord with Iran, Administration officials say that all they are sure the meeting can achieve is that Mr. Clinton will present that case to Mr. Yeltsin in person.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>More than 170 nations agreed today to extend in perpetuity a treaty that has limited the spread of nuclear arms for a quarter of a century.</p> <p>The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a bedrock agreement in Soviet-American relations that arose in the midst of the cold war, became permanent today by acclamation.</p> <p>The original treaty, which went into effect in 1970, had to be reviewed this year, to decide whether it should be extended for a set period, ended, or prolonged indefinitely. The treaty basically limits nuclear weapons to the five states that had proclaimed them at the time -- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union, now Russia. All other signers had to promise not to acquire them.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'elections']	<p>President Clinton came to this capital today to begin a two-day celebration of Ukraine's striking new willingness to surrender its nuclear weapons and embrace a market economy.</p> <p>With frictions between the United States and Ukraine over those issues now fading, the White House was unabashed in casting Mr. Clinton's visit as a tribute to the strides taken here by President Leonid Kuchma, who won election last July.</p>
['atomic energy']	<p>Iran expressed relief today that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia did not yield to President Clinton's pressure to cancel Russia's $1 billion nuclear accord with Iran.</p> <p>"Clinton has achieved no success," Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister, Mahmoud Vaezi, was quoted as saying by the official Islamic Republic News Agency after the results of Wednesday's meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin became known. "What we expect of Russia is to complete a nuclear power station for peaceful use of energy."</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>"We never considered not going," says a high Clinton aide about the trip to Moscow to celebrate the golden anniversary of the end of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War.</p> <p>Because Boris Yeltsin knew how eager Bill Clinton was to come (Reagan and Bush got D-Day, so Clinton gets V-E Day), we could extract no concessions beforehand. As a result, Russia's deal to help terrorist Iran become a nuclear power will go forward, and the Russian military's war on Chechnya will resume with greater fury the day after world leaders leave Moscow.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The promise you make with a gun to your head is devoid of moral or legal force. Nobody is obligated in any way to keep a pledge extracted under duress.</p> <p>That bedrock principle is worth restating in a week when concern for the lives of hostages caused governments to make promises to terrorists in Chechnya and Bosnia.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Enraged by Russia's humiliation at the hands of a band of Chechen terrorists, the Parliament here today overwhelmingly approved a motion of no confidence in the faltering Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>It was the first such vote ever to succeed in modern Russia, and in theory it carries only the weight of a formal rebuke. Mr. Yeltsin can ignore it until the Parliament passes another such motion, and then he can choose whether to dismiss the Government or dissolve Parliament and call new elections.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops opened an assault early this morning with tanks and heavy machine guns on the hospital in this southern Russian city where some 200 Chechen fighters have been holding up to 2,000 hostages since Wednesday.</p> <p>At 9 A.M. (1 A.M. Eastern time), nearly four hours after the battle began, fighting continued floor to floor in the hospital, according to Russian officials and soldiers near the scene. About 9:15 A.M. there was a lull, and Moscow radio said Chechen fighters had agreed to release woman and children and to continue negotiations, but there was no official reaction from the Russian side.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>After the failure of two attempts to storm the hospital where Chechen commandos still held as many as 1,000 hostages, Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, ordered a cease-fire throughout Chechnya today during negotiations by telephone with the commando leader and sent a high-level team to the Chechen capital for peace talks with rebel leaders.</p> <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin's forceful intervention was an astonishing reversal of tactics for the Russian Government. For months, it has refused Western entreaties to halt the fighting in Chechnya and begin serious negotiations with Chechen leaders. But it agreed to do so today in response to an extraordinary act of terrorism on Russian soil.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Svetlana Aleksandrovna was visiting her parents near Budyonnovsk with her 3-year-old son, Filip, and her younger sister, Larisa, 23, when Chechen militants seized the town on Wednesday. The three were taken hostage, and all she could think of was "how my parents would bury us -- three coffins in the courtyard here -- and I wondered which of my photographs they would choose for my headstone."</p> <p>Her husband, in St. Petersburg, still does not know that she and Filip were taken hostage, she said in a long interview in her parents' house in this village a few miles east of Budyonnovsk. Her parents did not want to worry him, she said, unrolling a much-creased telegram he sent here that starts, "So, how's life?"</p>
['terrorism', 'news and news media']	<p>Chechen gunmen who terrorized a Russian town for five days returned to their homeland in a bus convoy tonight and released their last hostages in a Chechen border town.</p> <p>The Chechen rebels, who had held hundreds of Russians captive in a hospital in the Russian town of Budyonnovsk, traveled into central Chechnya tonight with two buses and a refrigerated truck that carried their own dead from fighting Russian troops who twice tried to storm the hospital.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's steady, stocky Prime Minister, had himself a good week, forcefully intervening to save the lives of hundreds of Russians taken hostage by Chechen militants in Budyonnovsk.</p> <p>By contrast, President Boris N. Yeltsin, now 64, looked tired, vague and on the wrong side of these crucial events.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Senate Energy Committee sought today to save an East-West deal in which Russian nuclear warheads are to be turned into a peaceful bonanza, even as a businessman testified that the first phase of the venture had gone relatively smoothly and the Administration said any flaws that might endanger the deal could be straightened out.</p> <p>"We do not believe that this agreement is in serious jeopardy," Charles B. Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, told the committee.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>The West has the impression that Russia is rancid with crime, that gangs rule the streets, that few people are safe from a post-Soviet horde of muggers, murderers, racketeers and thieves.</p> <p>In Moscow, where gangland killings have a cinematic brutality, Russians have the same impression, and the perception of growing criminality, corruption and instability is associated in many minds with democracy and a market economy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>Russian and Chechen negotiators agreed today to hold national and regional elections in Chechnya, but the question of how and when such elections would be held and who would run them were too thorny to thrash out immediately so the negotiators called a three-day recess.</p> <p>After five days of talks, which are being held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the negotiators said they would extend a cease-fire that was due to expire today while they consult their governments.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A day after scores of Chechen rebel gunmen swept through a southern Russian town, shooting civilians and taking hundreds of hostages, the gang reportedly executed five captives tonight, forcing a startled Russia to confront the prospect of terrorism on its own soil.</p> <p>The commando attack in Budyonnovsk, a small provincial city about 70 miles north of the Chechen border, brought to reality the violent consequences many had feared from Russia's brutal military action in Chechnya. Chechen leaders, all but defeated in their bitter fight for independence, have frequently vowed to carry the war beyound the Chechen borders. Nobody knew how easy it could be.</p>
['elections']	<p>Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and his Government, supported by President Boris N. Yeltsin, today challenged legislators to repeat their vote of no-confidence and thus risk losing their seats in early parliamentary elections.</p> <p>The first no-confidence motion, passed on Wednesday, was essentially a cost-free vote, because the Constitution allows Mr. Yeltsin to ignore it. The vote was a way for deputies to cast a ballot against Mr. Yeltsin and the status quo, marking the real beginning of the election campaign for Parliament.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After agreeing to gradual disengagement of their military forces, Chechen and Russian negotiators meeting here today began to hash out details of Chechnya's future if and when soldiers lay down their arms, but adjourned for the day without touching the trickiest topic of all, how independent the secessionist republic would be.</p> <p>In the talks, Russians and Chechens, who are tired of war, are seeing the first real -- if highly fragile -- signs that both sides are ready to give peace a chance. And the fact that both sides agreed to meet again on Friday was viewed by many as a more optimistic development than anyone could have expected only days ago.</p>
['space', 'russia-international relations-us', 'space stations']	<p>If the linkup of Americans and Russians in space two decades ago was the equivalent of a date, the one set for Thursday is the start of a $100 billion marriage, a delicate one that could easily be undone by technical setbacks or political shifts.</p> <p>The space shuttle Atlantis is to dock with the Russian space station Mir about 9 A.M., hooking up a pressurized tunnel through which astronauts can float in shirt-sleeves. If successfully joined, the two craft will form a structure bigger and brighter than any other to probe the heavens in the 38 years since the space age began.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Machine-gun fire still rattles loudly at night, but by day, the dull pounding sound that echoes through collapsed buildings and rubble-strewn streets is that of hammers and pneumatic drills.</p> <p>The war in Chechnya is not over, and the temporary cease-fire is as fragile as the peace talks going on here. But refugees are returning to Grozny and slowly beginning to patch their lives back together.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'espionage']	<p>The name has been changed five times in the past five years. But the agency headquartered in what was the Lubyanka prison is still known here and abroad as the K.G.B.</p> <p>"Changing names is a hobby of ours," shrugs Aleksandr Mikhailov, press agent for what is this month called the Federal Security Service. On his office wall is a picture of, and a poem by, Yuri Andropov, who was K.G.B. chief when the agency acted as dread "sword and shield" of the Communist Party.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Chechen rebel commander whose fighters took more than 1,000 hostages and killed at least 120 people in a hospital in southern Russia two weeks ago now says he feels bad about the raid, and that he and his men "turned into beasts." But he also warned that similar acts of violence could follow.</p> <p>In his first television interview, from an undisclosed location, the fugitive commander, Shamil Basayev, calmly expressed his condolences to his victims. "Some may think its cynical, but I and the guys are saying this from our hearts."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The brother of Frederick C. Cuny, the American relief worker who has been missing in Chechnya since April 7, said today that he had received two reports this month from Russian officials that Mr. Cuny was seen alive in June and was being held by Chechen rebels.</p> <p>The Clinton Administration announced, meanwhile, that two agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation would arrive in Russia on Tuesday to investigate the Cuny case.</p>
['banks and banking', 'international trade and world market', 'currency', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The offshore banking system on this Mediterranean island is being used to violate United Nations sanctions imposed on the rump Yugoslavia and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars made illicitly in Russia, say Western diplomats, bankers and even some of those involved in the business.</p> <p>About three dozen of the 500 Serbian companies set up in Cyprus are believed to have links to the Government in Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin today accepted the resignation of one of the Russian Army's most popular and outspoken commanders, creating a powerful potential challenger for the 1996 presidential elections.</p> <p>The commander, Lieut. Gen. Aleksandr M. Lebed, is a veteran of the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan and has been a withering critic of the Russian military action in Chechnya.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic energy', 'atomic weapons', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The leaders of the seven major industrial nations issued a double-pronged warning today to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, telling him that the "situation in Chechnya should not be resolved by military means" and indirectly condemning his Government's planned sale of nuclear reactors to Iran.</p> <p>In remarks to reporters before he and President Clinton met for private talks, an obviously agitated Mr. Yeltsin pronounced Chechnya "the center of world terrorism, of bribery and corruption and mafia."</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>Three years after Russia agreed to provide the United States with uranium from scrapped Russian nuclear weapons, the deal is unraveling, prompting a quiet struggle to save the accord, Federal and private experts say.</p> <p>Russia was to get $12 billion in desperately needed hard currency, and the United States was to get 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium, which was to be diluted to make fuel for American nuclear power plants and ultimately electricity for consumers.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>In a severe humiliation for Russia's military and Government, a Chechen commando leader who terrorized this small Russian town and took up to 2,000 hostages was allowed to leave freely today for Chechnya after nearly all his demands had been met. He took with him his fighters and about 150 hostages.</p> <p>After nine hours of intense negotiations, as the people of Budyonnovsk waited on street corners in the broiling sun to discover the fate of their loved ones, the Chechen commando leader, Shamil Basayev, and his entourage sped out of the gates of the hospital complex they had seized in a daring raid on Wednesday, leaving most of their hostages behind them.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Russian television viewers have a pretty high threshold for amazement. That's understandable in a country that has watched a coup attempt, the death of an empire, an assault by the President on Parliament and a brutal war.</p> <p>But even for Russia, the sight of the stolid, dour Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, negotiating live, on television, with the leader of a band of Chechen terrorists provoked amazement here today.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In what served as a rebuke to the Chechen rebel leader's renewed demand for independence, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia issued a decree today ordering Russian military units to be permanently stationed in Chechnya.</p> <p>Moscow has said all along that it planned to keep troops in Chechnya if and when a political settlement to the conflict there is reached. In exchange for a substantive withdrawal of troops, Chechen negotiators had tentatively agreed to return to what was the military status quo before the war. But the timing of the decree, set against new obstacles in the peace talks, mainly seemed aimed at reasserting Russian authority over the secessionist region.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Russian Government averted a political showdown today when Parliament failed to gather the 226 votes needed to pass a vote of no confidence. Had the measure passed, President Boris N. Yeltsin would have been forced either to dismiss his Cabinet or to dissolve the legislature and hold early elections.</p> <p>Seconds after the voting ended, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin strode to the podium in what looked a little like a victory lap. Speaking ingratiatingly, though, he said the vote "has drawn a line through the crisis."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Chechen delegation broke off peace negotiations today with Russian officials to protest the killing of seven civilians, including two little girls and an old man, by men dressed in Russian uniforms.</p> <p>The Russian military denied involvement in the killings and said that they were intended to derail the peace talks, which are the most serious effort so far to end the war in the breakaway region in southern Russia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'energy and power', 'accidents and safety', 'atomic energy']	<p>Underscoring previous warnings from Western experts about the dangers of Soviet-built nuclear power plants, a Federal intelligence report says 10 reactors in Slovakia, Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine face an abnormally high risk of failure.</p> <p>The danger is attributed to design flaws, tattered economies, political disorder and weak regulatory oversight.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Moving decisively to reshape his Government before an important parliamentary challenge on Saturday, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced tonight that he was dismissing the ministers of Security, the Interior, and Nationalities for their failures in responding to a hostage-taking by Chechen rebels in southern Russia.</p> <p>It was the most serious Government shake-up since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, and it represents something of a gamble for Mr. Yeltsin. He is removing most of the so-called power ministers, whose ministries were involved in the failed August 1991 coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Early in the search for Frederick C. Cuny, the disaster relief expert who disappeared in Chechnya in April, there were two Cuny family members, three interpreters, a Chechen guide, a Cossack private investigator, two cars with four drivers and several American diplomats and international aid experts working feverishly to track him down.</p> <p>Now the pace of the search has slowed, and the cramped, rented house known as Cuny headquarters in this small village near the Chechen border is almost empty. Time is running out, and so is hope of finding Mr. Cuny and his three-person team.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Uniting after weeks of disarray, the United States, Britain and France today pledged a broad and sustained campaign of air attacks if the Bosnian Serbs attack Gorazde, an enclave in eastern Bosnia that the United Nations has declared a "safe area."</p> <p>After a conference of 16 countries involved in the Bosnian war, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said, "The Bosnian Serb leaders are now on notice that an attack against Gorazde will be met by substantial and decisive air power."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>Seven months after Russian forces invaded the secessionist region of Chechnya, peace negotiators for both sides said tonight they had reached an agreement that would guarantee the region "the broadest form of statehood," but not the total independence it sought.</p> <p>Details of the accord will not be released officially before it is to be signed in the next day or two, the negotiators said in Grozny, the Chechen capital. But the main points were reported tonight on Independent Russian Television.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Western European governments and Russia consider the Senate vote a grave mistake, and they warned again that American arms shipments to the Bosnian Government would lead to the withdrawal of all United Nations forces.</p> <p>Having recently strengthened the United Nations force with about 10,000 additional troops and won United Nations assent to increased NATO air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs attack the enclave around Gorazde, Western European governments said the Senate vote could undermine the impression of greater allied resolve.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After seven months of a war that has devastated much of Chechnya and damaged the course of Russian reform, officials for both sides signed a partial treaty today that they said would bring an end to the fighting.</p> <p>"We have now legally confirmed the end of the war in Chechnya," said Usman Imayev, the senior Chechen negotiator at a news conference in Grozny, after signing a military accord there with his Russian counterparts.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Major progress has been made in repairing an East-West deal in which the nuclear material from thousands of Russian warheads is to be transformed into a peaceful bonanza of nuclear energy, Federal officials say. But private experts assert that the undertaking is still in doubt and might fall apart.</p> <p>The deal, hammered out three years ago after the Soviet Union collapsed, would have the United States pay Russia $12 billion for diluting 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium from nuclear arms into reactor fuel that would be used for generating electricity in America. The deal was hailed as a significant step in reducing the risk that bomb ingredients could be stolen in Russia and sold to terrorists or to countries seeking to develop a bomb.</p>
['banks and banking', 'economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power', 'taxation', 'ethics']	<p>Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's Prime Minister, is widely seen as a potential successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin. Since becoming Prime Minister in December 1992, Mr. Chernomyrdin, the former Soviet Minister for Natural Gas, has grown remarkably in office.</p> <p>He has developed a sophisticated new understanding of macroeconomics and of political survival, nurtured a close relationship with Vice President Al Gore and disclosed a new humanity to Russians when he negotiated an end to the hostage crisis in Budyonnovsk.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Standing in front of his office window overlooking the Kremlin, Oleg Boiko was contemplating whether he should acquire a new license plate for his limousine.</p> <p>At 30, Mr. Boiko, one of Russia's richest businessmen, had in mind a special plate with a tricolor flag indicating that the driver is a high-level Government official immune fromordinary traffic regulations. Only 500 such plates are supposed to be issued for all of Russia.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>A plan by the Federal Government to sell the operations that produce fuel for the nation's nuclear power plants -- the largest privatization ever attempted by Washington -- has long been counted on to demonstrate commitment to leaner government. But with the White House ready to announce details of the sale this week, a debate is raging over whether such a sale would do more harm than good.</p> <p>The central question is one familiar whenever a government sells off a chunk of itself: would a private owner's financial interests be at odds with the national interest?</p>
['television', 'news and news media', 'law and legislation']	<p>Sounding hoarse but robust, President Boris N. Yeltsin appeared on television from his hospital room here tonight to prove that while he was sick, he was not as sick as the Kremlin had led people to believe by its insistence that he was fine.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin was flushed into public view by serious questions about the authenticity of the only photograph released of the President after he was hospitalized on July 11. The picture, distributed by the Itar-Tass news agency last Friday, showed Mr. Yeltsin in an Ellesse tennis shirt seated at a desk next to a table with four telephones. It appeared identical to footage of the Russian President, wearing an Ellesse tennis shirt at a desk next to four telephones, that was filmed when he was on vacation in southern Russia last April. Mr. Yeltsin's press secretary said it was taken at Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow on Friday.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Eager for a central mediating role in the widening Balkan war, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called again today for an international peace conference to be held here under his direction.</p> <p>At the same time, though, he warned that further Croatian aggression against Serbs could force Russia to abandon unilaterally the international sanctions that have been imposed on what is left of Yugoslavia: Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>In its first electoral outing, the new political party created by President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, suffered a humiliating defeat in Mr. Yeltsin's home province, according to final election results reported today.</p> <p>Eduard Rossel, whom Mr. Yeltsin dismissed two years ago as the Governor of Sverdlovsk because he advocated greater regional independence, trounced Aleksei Strakhov, the man who was appointed to replace him, by a 2-to-1 margin.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>Two years ago, President Clinton and Congress joined hands to create two investment funds that were to be the primary tools for pumping American money into Russia's ravaged economy and teaching the American way of doing business.</p> <p>But the lessons the two funds have been offering lately are surely not ones the Americans intended: about board room fights, wounded egos, invective and angry resignations. And some people say the ultimate lesson may be that the formula for success on Wall Street does not always work in public and nonprofit operations.</p>
['medicine and health', 'accidents and safety']	<p>Life expectancy in Russia, already lower than in any other developed country, has plummeted again this year, and scientists and public health officials say they cannot explain the continuing steep decline.</p> <p>For the last several years health statistics here have been hard to believe: no country that reports to the World Heath Organization has a life expectancy as low. Life expectancy for men born in Russia this year is lower than in India, Egypt or Bolivia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Clinton said today that Croatia's offensive to recover a swath Croatian that has been under the control of rebel Serbs since 1991 could prove helpful in resolving the four-year-old Balkan conflict.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton, who had delivered his weekly radio address at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., made his comments to the ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, who had undergone surgery on Tuesday to remove a cancerous lymph node from his groin. After questioning the President, Mr. Donaldson filed a radio report from his hospital bed.</p>
['espionage', 'biographical information']	<p>Relatives of an American disaster relief expert who disappeared in Chechnya in April said today that he was executed on April 14 by Chechen rebels who were told by Russian intelligence agents that he was a spy.</p> <p>"Let it be known to all nations and humanitarian organizations that Russia was responsible for the death of one of the world's great humanitarians," Christopher R. Cuny said grimly at a news conference in Moscow to announce the end of his family's search for his brother, Frederick C. Cuny.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Col. Gen. Dmitri A. Volkogonov, historian and former chief of the Soviet military's psychological warfare department, knows that he is dying, and indeed should be dead.</p> <p>But General Volkogonov, 67, who was operated on twice for colon and liver cancer four years ago, has work left to do on what has become his life's mission: to finish his book, drawn from secret Kremlin archives, about the seven leaders who ran the Soviet Union in its 74 years of "Triumph and Tragedy," as he called his revelatory biography of Stalin.</p>
['taxation', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Spread regally across the rolling hills above Golden Horn Bay, Vladivostok has in just a few years become the garish showcase for all that ails modern Russia, and most of what could save it.</p> <p>No other city holds more promise for the future or greater potential for prosperity. Its mighty port, sprawling forests and vast mineral wealth have made trading partners from Seoul to Seattle drool. There are yachts in the harbor and $60,000 Range Rovers on the pitted streets.</p>
['space', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>After a debate that evoked memories of the cold war years, the Senate moved ahead today with plans to revive a version of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, beating back attempts by Democrats to eliminate money and authorization for a land-based national defense against long-range missiles.</p> <p>The Clinton Administration and Senate Democrats say the plan would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a cornerstone of American arms control policy, and rekindle cold war tensions with Russia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia and the United States, which have separately proposed new diplomatic initiatives to halt the widening war in the Balkans, sought to coordinate their approaches at a meeting here today.</p> <p>Moscow is eager to play a larger role in bringing an end to the fighting, but its support for Serbia, a traditional Russian ally, has often put it at odds with Western diplomatic efforts.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>NATO diplomats said today that a committee was making progress on resolving the issue of how countries from outside the alliance could take part in any military operation to enforce a peace settlement in Bosnia.</p> <p>The United States wants NATO in command of any such operation as a condition to sending up to 25,000 American soldiers to Bosnia -- about half the estimated force -- to take part in it.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Calling for NATO to be transformed from a military into a purely political organization, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia said today that the expansion of NATO "will mean a conflagration of war throughout Europe, for sure."</p> <p>In an 85-minute news conference in the Kremlin, Mr. Yeltsin gave fervent expression to his "conviction," as he called it, that NATO's bombing of the Bosnian Serbs was a first sign of how an expanded NATO, under American control, would behave on Russia's borders.</p>
['religion and churches', 'foreign aid']	<p>Arching out of the vivid, azure blue of Lake Baikal, where it laps up against Olkhon Island, is one of Buddhism's holiest sites, the Shaman Rock. It is revered by the native Buryat people, and the Dalai Lama has also prayed here.</p> <p>In the Soviet period, when most native traditions and religion itself were considered anti-state activities, the authorities built a dock directly under the Shaman Rock, where ships unloaded supplies and diesel oil for this small town of 1,500 and picked up the garbage.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>After a painful and chaotic slide, the Russian economy appears to be stabilizing, and may be on the brink of growing for the first time since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p> <p>There is still considerable risk that things could go awry again, and the gains that look so impressive on statistical charts have been slow to filter down to ordinary Russians. But nearly all the signs are positive.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>Envoys to NATO approved a blueprint tonight that outlines membership requirements for formerly Communist European countries that want to join the alliance, overriding Russia's continuing strong objections to the very idea of NATO expansion.</p> <p>NATO did not make its paper public today, but officials said it would be presented next Thursday in Brussels and in the following weeks in more detail in other capitals.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'bombs and explosives', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>A rocket-propelled grenade fired from a busy Moscow street blasted through a wall into the United States Embassy here today, destroying a copying machine in an office inside but causing no injuries.</p> <p>There were no arrests or immediate claims of responsibility for the attack, which took place at 4:25 P.M. local time. But the question on the minds of American and Russian officials was whether it was a violent manifestation of the increasing tension between the United States and Russia over NATO's bombing campaign against the Bosnian Serbs.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>Fragmented and weakened, Russia's many democratic parties are being urged by Western advisers to unite into one front for the parliamentary elections in December. President Boris Yeltsin, stung by his party's defeat in an election in his home province last month, says such a bloc is the only alternative to authoritarianism from the left and right. But forging a coalition would be a mistake for democrats, who disagree with the Government over everything from the war in Chechnya to the direction of economic reforms.</p> <p>The divisions in the democratic camp do not merely express conflicting ambitions among its leaders. They result from, among other things, the Government's failure to allow most citizens to acquire property and from its capitulation to a small business elite that is getting rich on its economic policies. As a result, democratic reforms have become associated in too many minds with robbing the people and imposing hardship on the many for the benefit of the few.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Serbs of Bosnia today took the first steps to lift the siege of Sarajevo, reopening the roads and the airport and giving relief convoys free passage. They also withdrew a few tanks, howitzers and heavy artillery pieces from the hills surrounding the Bosnian capital.</p> <p>President Clinton led a chorus of NATO allies and -- after a week of intensifying criticism -- the Russians in welcoming the brokered agreement, which calls for the Serbs to withdraw their heavy weaponry in exchange for a halt in the NATO bombing campaign.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>In a concession intended to reduce tensions with Moscow, the United States and its NATO allies decided today to permit Russia to keep more tanks and artillery pieces in the Caucasus region than would be allowed under a 1990 treaty.</p> <p>American officials said a NATO commission made the decision in Brussels because of fears that tensions could mushroom and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe could fall apart. Russia has threatened to flout new restrictions that take effect on Nov. 17.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's isolation over Bosnia deepened today as an obviously frustrated President Boris N. Yeltsin, domestic politics on his mind, warned Western leaders that Moscow would have to rethink its partnership with NATO if the alliance continued to bomb the Bosnian Serbs.</p> <p>In a series of meetings with European leaders over the last week, Mr. Yeltsin has complained that Russia's views on Bosnia and its opposition to the bombing are ignored by NATO. With each meeting his comments have become harsher and more pointed as the West continues, in his view, to brush aside Russian reservations.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>On the eve of crucial American-led talks among the three warring parties in Bosnia, NATO expanded its air campaign against Serb-held positions in Bosnia today, bombing bridges, ammunition dumps, communications centers and air defense radars.</p> <p>The bombings came as President Clinton met with his senior advisers to discuss how to convince the warring parties to accept the United Nations-brokered partition of the country and enforce an eventual settlement. But President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia warned that Moscow would have to rethink its partnership with NATO if the alliance continued its bombings.</p>

['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N.

['biographical information']	<p>Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev responded today to a barrage of criticism  from President Boris N. Yeltsin by saying he will stay in his job only if he is  not treated as a servant.</p> <p>"If people are needed who can be talked down to," Mr. Kozyrev said on the television program Podrobnosti (Details), "then it would really be better to look for a new team."</p>
['elections']	<p>Outrage grew today over the Russian Central Election Commission's decision to ban the nation's leading liberal party from the Dec. 17 parliamentary elections, as politicians from every part of the political spectrum demanded that the decision be reversed.</p> <p>"It was to say the least ill considered," Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said today of the commission's decision on Sunday to bar Yabloko because the party had made a technical error in preparing its list of more than  200 candidates.</p>

['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'television', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>Seeking to polish his Administration's tarnished image as parliamentary elections approach, President Boris N. Yeltsin today rid himself of his Acting Prosecutor General, Aleksei N. Ilyushenko, who resigned under pressure.</p> <p>Mr. Ilyushenko, 38, a Yeltsin loyalist, alienated democrats and liberals in Russia by his attempts to prosecute the privately owned television network NTV. NTV's coverage of the war in Chechnya has been highly critical of the Government.</p> <p>"The President considers this a civil act which reflects the moral spirit and sense of political responsibility developing in the new state apparatus," Mr. Yeltsin's press spokesman, Sergei K. Medvedev, said of Mr. Iluyshenko's offer to resign.</p> <p>Mr. Iluyshenko won international attention -- and mockery -- when he began legal proceedings against the producers of a popular satirical puppet show broadcast by NTV, saying the show's depictions of Mr. Yeltsin and other high officials were "insulting."</p> <p>As the equivalent of the United States Attorney General, Mr. Ilyushenko was in charge of fighting crime, and he was widely blamed for his office's inability to stanch corruption and mob violence, or solve such sensational murders as the assassination of a popular television personality, Vladislav Listyev, who was killed in April.</p> <p>But it was press reports about the involvement of his wife and other family members with a small car dealership that mysteriously won a highly lucrative licence to export Russian oil that sealed Mr. Ilyushenko's fate. The press accounts suggested that Mr. Ilyushenko had used his high office -- and contacts deep in the Kremlin -- to enrich himself and his friends.</p> <p>Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December. At a news conference last month, Mr. Yeltsin appeared to cut the Prosecutor General loose, saying, "Of course Ilyushenko denies everything, but after all these blemishes, I will hardly recommend him again as Prosecutor General."</p> <p>Today, Mr. Medvedev said the dismissal was "not a surprise because the President earlier voiced his dissatisfaction over Ilyushenko's work, including in public."</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin nominated Mr. Ilyushenko to be Prosecutor General in February 1994, but Parliament twice refused to confirm him, and he carried on in the job on an acting basis.  He was appointed by Mr. Yeltsin to replace Aleksei Kasannik, who resigned in protest over pressure from Mr. Yeltsin to override a general amnesty voted by Parliament in 1994, which set free, among others, the leaders of the October 1993 parliamentary insurrection against Mr. Yeltsin.</p> <p>"Given public opinion and the upcoming elections, Yeltsin couldn't afford not to get rid of him," said Vera Kuznetsova, the political editor of Radio Liberty in Moscow. "But it was also a typical Yeltsin move. He uses such people to do his dirty work, and when they become too tainted, he gets rid of them."</p> <p>But if Mr. Yeltsin hoped to win points for forcing out the unpopular Mr. Iluyshenko, he did not appease his critics on the right or left. Yegor T. Gaidar, the leader of the democratic party Russia's Choice, and the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov dismissed the move as too little, too late.</p> <p>The Kremlin said today that Mr. Iluyshnko's deputy, Oleg Gaidanov, would temporarily fill his post.</p>

['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The meager results of this week's lunch-hour summit between President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin will strengthen skeptics in both countries who say we should stop pretending to be "partners."</p> <p>Zbigniew Brzezinski has called Russia "irrelevant," and this sneering term enjoys a minor vogue even at the State Department. In Moscow, Anatoly Adamishin, Ambassador to Britain and among the most likely successors to Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, expresses a surprisingly similar view.  Although he has for years been one of his country's most pro-Western diplomats, Mr. Adamishin now calls on Russia to "step to the sidelines." There's no need for all-out hostility toward the West, he wrote recently, but for the foreseeable future Russia will be too weak to be taken seriously by the United States and its allies.  Better, then, to stand alone.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>As a man trained in philosophy, Gennadi A. Zyuganov loves to toss around the  big words of the 20th century. He is forever talking about the social democrats  of Britain and the egalitarianism of Sweden. And about how liberalism changes when it travels from Germany to Italy to Spain.</p> <p>But there is one big word you almost never hear the balding, reflective Mr. Zyuganov say out loud: Communism. For some people, particularly in Russia these  days, that would be completely understandable. For the active, voluble and extremely popular chairman of what is still called the Communist Party, it seems a little bit strange.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Barely suppressing their mutual distaste, three Balkan Presidents came together today at an American military base for ambitious peace talks aimed at ending four years of terror and bloodshed in Bosnia.</p> <p>It was the first time the three men -- Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia -- have met face to face since they held a series of unsuccessful meetings in Yugoslavia in 1991 on the eve of the country's division and disintegration into war. Thus just bringing them into the same room represented a considerable achievement.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Just as an attempted coup by K.G.B. hard-liners led to the elevation of Boris Yeltsin, an attempted purge masterminded by the hospitalized Yeltsin's palace guard may do the same for Grigory Yavlinsky.</p> <p>The Central Election Commission, dominated by the Filatov-Korzhakov-Satarov Kremlin cabal, began the purge early last week by disqualifying two minor parties from next month's parliamentary elections.  One was led by the reformer  Galina Starovoitova, the other by the anti-Yeltsin rightist Aleksandr Rutskoi. There was no outcry.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Vasily N. Dyakonov, a huge and noisy man, was the first governor appointed by President Boris N. Yeltsin after the failed coup of August 1991. "Then the battle really began," Mr. Dyakonov said with a touch of wistfulness.</p> <p>A former builder and director of a big construction company, he regards himself as a radical democrat. He lit happily into fierce battles, one with the  Communist Party bosses who ran the Krasnodar region in southern Russia and who mostly supported the coup attempt against Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and another with Mr. Yeltsin, who favored more radical change.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Yitzhak Rabin was buried today before the greatest assembly of foreign leaders ever gathered in Israel, eulogized by President Clinton as "a martyr for peace" and by King Hussein of Jordan as "a brother, a colleague and a friend."</p> <p>In ceremonies that blended military precision, ringing tributes and home-grown emotion, Mr. Rabin's body was laid to rest under the pines and cypresses of Mount Herzl, the burial ground of Israel's military and spiritual</p> <p>heros.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Issuing a major policy statement on arms control, China tonight sharply rebuked the United States, Russia, Britain and France for continuing to develop  "nuclear weapons and outer space weapons, including guided missile defense systems," while seeking in some cases to deny the peaceful use of nuclear technology to the developing world.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Violating a long-recognized if unspoken diplomatic tradition, a senior American official here has published a lengthy and unflattering article that portrays the Kremlin as a warren of rival cliques struggling to hang on to their power and privileges.</p> <p>The Russian Government today lodged an official protest with the United States Embassy and demanded a public explanation.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Anxious Russian officials assured people today that there was nothing dangerous in the radioactive container removed on Thursday from a Moscow park where it apparently had been placed by Chechen separatists.</p> <p>The 30-pound box containing radioactive cesium was found buried under snow near the entrance to Izmailovsky Park, one of Moscow's most popular recreation areas, after Chechnya's best-known rebel leader, Shamil Basayev, told Russian television reporters where to find it.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The auditorium was shabby, poorly lighted, and freezing. Most of the seats were empty and the speaker -- practically the only person there not wearing an overcoat -- couldn't seem to get the microphone to work.</p> <p>People seemed restless, embarrassed, bored. The chubby man at the podium, a principal architect of Russia's remarkable journey from Communism to democracy,  was losing ground with nearly every word he spoke.</p>
['elections']	<p>Peace on Earth" cannot be achieved until the other part of the Christmas message comes to pass: "good will toward men."</p> <p>I read that last phrase -- with the translation of "men" dutifully updated to "one another" -- in its broadest modern sense, to mean "an embrace of the yearning of the human spirit for freedom."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>A candidate for Russia's Parliament was found dead today on the doorstep of his village home in the Urals, shot in what his party said was an attempt to frighten voters before the Dec. 17 elections.</p> <p>The candidate, Mikhail Lezhnev, 48, was on the ticket of Our Home Is Russia,  the party led by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. The party called the slaying "a malicious, deliberate political act intended to intimidate voters who plan to support this party."</p>

['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>At least three Russian soldiers and nine Chechen rebels have been reported killed in scattered fighting across the breakaway republic of Chechnya.</p> <p>The battles late Tuesday and early today were heaviest around the capital, Grozny. Russian troops said they destroyed several rebel trucks, armored vehicles and an ammunitions depot, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Rebel fighters pulled out of Gudermes, Chechnya's second biggest town, today  after a weeklong battle with Russian troops that the town's mayor said had killed more than 100 civilians.</p> <p>Aslan Maskhadov, overall commander of the Chechen separatist rebels, said he  had ordered his fighters to withdraw "to avoid further victims among the two sides and among peaceful civilians."</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Stung by recent and unusually open criticism by American diplomats here, Russian officials today expressed public outrage and private bafflement over a comment made this week by Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering disputing Russia's claims to islands that were seized from Japan at the end of World War II.</p> <p>Moscow's anger underscored the Russian Government's edgy mood before parliamentary elections on Dec. 17. It also hinted at mounting ill feeling between the Kremlin and the United States Embassy.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>With four days left before parliamentary elections here, the Russian Government's political leadership is spending much of its time trying not to panic -- and the rest of the time reminding voters that Communism was, is and always will be bad.</p> <p>At a news conference today, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin acknowledged that the Communists would prevail on Sunday. But he added that even if they did, his Government would continue its policies of reform.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Here is Gennady Punditsky with my insider's forecast of Sunday's Russian election, including how to instantly analyze results, also what it will all mean.</p> <p>"The Commies are coming!" is what your American headlines are screaming. Polls say Communist Party will win 25 percent of party vote for seats in the Duma. This noisy Parliament is our version of U.N. General Assembly -- all talk, with real power remaining in Kremlin -- but its election is like snow blowing in wind about presidential election next June.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Results of last week's parliamentary election were announced by Russia's Central Electoral Commission today, indicating that the Communist Party will control 158 of 450 seats in the lower house of Parliament.</p> <p>Half the seats in that body are elected by single-seat constituencies. The other 225 are elected according to party lists with a minimum five percent of the vote needed to win seats. The exact allocation of party list seats will be announced later.  According to the estimates released today, the Communists would have 158 seats, including 58 elected in single-seat constituencies, in the lower house, or Duma. Ultra-nationalists in the Liberal Democratic Party would have 51 seats, with only one from a single-seat vote.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'children and youth', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>In June 1992, Nina Zvereva was approached in a Moscow courtyard as she washed a battered brown Zhiguli, a Soviet-made Fiat.</p> <p>Then 28, she was just learning to drive, and she and her younger sister, Natasha, their husbands and their parents were struggling to find a niche in the new economy six months after the Soviet Union collapsed, prices were freed from Government controls and inflation gathered a frightening momentum.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Supporters of President Lech Walesa threw Poland into a political uproar today, demanding an investigation into whether Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy, a former regional Communist boss, ever spied for Russia.</p> <p>Although Mr. Walesa's backers refused to say it directly, they indicated that Mr. Oleksy had been spying for Russia.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>With his aides still reeling from their defeat by the Communists, President Boris N. Yeltsin today spoke up for the first time since Sunday's parliamentary  elections to assure the country that the Government would not change its course.</p> <p>"We have no reason for concern or to view the election as a tragedy," Mr. Yeltsin said from the clinic where he is being treated for heart trouble.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>The leader of Russia's Communist Party should be having a ball right now. When voters elect a new Parliament on Sunday there is little doubt that his slate will win more votes than any other.</p> <p>But the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, has suddenly begun to discover that resurrection has its price. For months he has sold himself and his party as being more like Western European Social Democrats than the gruesome Stalinists Russia thought it put to the stake four years ago.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The Clinton Administration responded with equanimity today to the preliminary outcome of parliamentary elections in Russia, despite the revival at the polls of the once-moribund Communist Party.</p> <p>"I think there's a sense of calm and perspective about this election," said Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>There has long been a feeling among political leaders here and in the West that the road to reform in Russia has passed the shaky stage at which it could be reversed. Democracy, openness and freedom are established rights in this country -- people have quickly learned to rely on them -- and even the most fiery extremists have stopped pretending these liberties do not matter.</p> <p>But if the early trends from parliamentary elections on Sunday showed anything clearly, they once again pointed out the futility of assuming that the  future course of Russian life is certain. As expected, voters supported almost anybody but the Government that now leads them. With 43 parties to choose from,  anger got the biggest response of all.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The Communist Party appeared certain today of having defeated the Government's party by more than two to one in parliamentary elections on Sunday, a victory that gave the party a strong head start in a pivotal presidential campaign that effectively began today.</p> <p>With 40 percent of the vote counted, the Communist share was holding firm at  about 22 percent, and Gennadi Zyuganov, the party leader, was talking of forming a "nationalist-patriotic" coalition with Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, leader of the  ultra nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, which according to the latest figures was second in the parliamentary vote with about 11 percent.</p>
['elections']	<p>In what could prove to be a stark political nightmare for Russian reformers,  an immensely popular nationalist figure, Aleksandr I. Lebed, announced today that he would seek the presidency next June, and said he intended to do it "in agreement" with the Communists.</p> <p>It has long been assumed that the hard-bitten former general would run for President next year. But if he were to join forces with the Communist Party -- which received more than twice the votes of any other group in this month's parliamentary election -- he would become the instant front-runner.</p>
['television']	<p>With Russia's Parliamentary elections set for Sunday and Presidential elections promised in June, tomorrow night's look at four of President Boris N.  Yeltsin's opponents is timely if not blindly illuminating. To the program's title question, "Russia Betrayed?," all four answer in the affirmative. But once past a unanimous desire to replace the perceived betrayer, their policies cloud  up.</p> <p>The "Voices of the Opposition" heard from are, in no particular order: Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, a former Vice President and air force general who was jailed for his part in the October 1993 Parliamentary clash with Mr. Yeltsin; Aleksandr I. Lebed, a popular former general who leads a nationalist movement called the Congress of Russian Communities; Gennady A. Zyuganov, a sometime Soviet official who now runs the Russian Communist Party, and Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economist and the liberal hope.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>There is no such thing as moderation in the Arctic. Russia learned that lesson well enough a few years ago, when the coal miners of this former penal colony, which is closer to the North Pole than to Moscow, helped bring Communism to its knees.</p> <p>Tired of cheap slogans and empty promises, the miners from this harsh outpost on the tundra led a national strike in 1989, and their undimmed fury two years later helped propel the reform leader, Boris N. Yeltsin, to the Russian presidency.</p>
['elections', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>On New Year's Eve, Russia's largest television network is to broadcast a three-hour special intended to tap into the growing nostalgia for Soviet times.</p> <p>This slick tribute to Stalinist propaganda films that idealize life on the collective farm stars Russia's best-known pop singers recreating vignettes from creaky classics like the 1950 musical "Cossacks of the Kuban."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Breaking weeks of silence about Russia's critical parliamentary elections, President Boris N. Yeltsin came out of his medical seclusion tonight with a dramatic last-minute warning to voters that a Communist victory on Sunday would  inexorably return Russia to the cruelest excesses of its Soviet past.</p> <p>"This is not the light at the end of the tunnel," Mr. Yeltsin said in his 12-minute televised speech taped at the hospital where he is recovering from a heart ailment. "Most probably it is a reflection of new and more horrible fires  of a civil war."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>An early round of Russian parliamentary elections was severely disrupted today by fierce rebel attacks in two major Chechen towns, and federal troops seemed to suffer severe casualties in each of them.</p> <p>The fighting broke out only days after the leader of the Chechen secessionists, Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev, promised not to interfere with the voting.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Aleksander Kwasniewski was sworn in today as the President of Poland, and faced immediate political problems over allegations that his Prime Minister has  spied for Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Kwasniewski, a former Communist, defeated President Lech Walesa, the former Solidarity leader, in last month's election.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian heavy artillery and missiles pounded the rebel-held town of Gudermes  in Chechnya today as senior military commanders said they were launching an operation to retake it.</p> <p>Soon after noon, the intensity of the bombardment grew as refugees left the town, five miles from Kurchaloi, where reporters heard the bombardment, the Interfax news agency said.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>As if the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin hasn't heard enough grim news this week, the figures from individual parliamentary races started to pour  in today and the results were more of the same, only much worse.</p> <p>It now appears certain that Communists will control virtually a third of Russia's new Parliament, far more seats than even they had hoped for. If their close ideological soul mates in the Agrarian Party are included in the calculations, the figure is even higher.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Despite the alarmist cries in the West over the outcome of Russia's election  on Sunday, the overall balance in Parliament between the Communists and nationalists, on one hand, and the broad reformist middle, on the other, will not change.</p> <p>In fact, the election was a virtual replay of the voting in 1993. The only shifts have taken place within -- not between -- the two broad camps of voters.  The electorate may be deeply polarized between the opponents and supporters of the current course of reform, but it has remained extremely stable in its sentiments. And, in a victory for democracy, more than 60 percent of the electorate voted, more than all the polls predicted.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Russian voters registered their deep frustration with four years of faltering reforms on Sunday by voting for Communists and nationalists in even larger numbers than many people expected, according to early returns in the parliamentary election.</p> <p>It had long been assumed that Communists would win the most parliamentary seats, and with results streaming in from the 100,000 polling points across the  country, that seemed certain. But the ultranationalist party of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky again confounded predictions by performing well in early results. When Mr. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party received more votes than any other party in 1993 it produced a shock that reverberated across Russia and into the West.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>All fall, it was an election campaign propelled by fear, mistrust and anger.  But when the day of reckoning finally came, Russian voters seemed almost cheerful.</p> <p>They turned out in high numbers despite freezing weather and a raging flu epidemic -- some wore gauze masks as they voted. And many seemed pleased with the process, if not always the politicians.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>It is never hard to spot the relief workers spread among the desperate people of this shattered city: they are the ones in the white Land Cruisers with bold,  colorful flags flying from the hoods. They wear Gore-Tex hiking boots, carry satellite phones in their day packs, and usually report to headquarters in Geneva, Paris or Bonn.</p> <p>Except, of course, for the crew based in Boarding School No. 1.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>An explosion blew apart the office of a far-right member of the Russian Parliament this evening, less than two weeks before the parliamentary elections.</p> <p>Nobody was hurt in the attack. The legislator, Nikolai Lysenko, had left his  seventh-floor office in the Parliament building only moments before the explosion.</p>
['elections', 'television', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The most arresting political ads flooding Russian television right now do not divulge who the candidate is or what party is being promoted. Instead, a series  of heart-warming vignettes broadcast on the state-controlled network, ORT, gauzily suggest that, while it isn't quite paradise, life here isn't really so bad after all.</p> <p>Funnily enough, that is the message that the pro-Government party Our Home Is Russia is desperately trying to sell to disgruntled voters.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>Rebels seized key buildings in Chechnya's second-largest city today and fought advancing Russian armored troops on the first day of elections to replace the republic's secessionist government.</p> <p>As many as 600 rebels battled federal troops in and around Gudermes, 20 miles east of the Chechen capital, Grozny, Russian officials said.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>This is how the Government thought this year's parliamentary elections would  work: Russia's powerful regional governors would gratefully join Prime Minister  Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's party and recruit other local officials, who in turn would lean on factory directors who depend on Government credits to support the party that holds the purse strings.</p> <p>That was the theory.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>In somber silence, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia signed a peace agreement today, even as scattered violence in Bosnia made clear that real peace was not yet at hand.</p> <p>Today's ceremony, presided over by President Clinton and other international  sponsors, cleared the way for the deployment of 60,000 NATO peacekeeping troops  and the commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild the country after nearly four cruel years of war.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia left a hospital today where he has been  under treatment for a heart ailment, his press service said.</p> <p>He went to a country residence on the outskirts of Moscow, the report said, and he met with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin about his Cabinet.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia's new Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, set the tone today for Russian foreign policy until the presidential elections next June. And in keeping with the emotional political climate at home, the tone was decidedly nationalistic.</p> <p>"Russia was and remains a great power," he declared in his first news conference since he was appointed on Tuesday. "Her foreign policy should correspond to that status."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Russians came today, only 150 of them, but it was a historic occasion, the first time Russian and American soldiers have been in the same European theater of operations as allies since fighting Nazi Germany together.</p> <p>Reflecting the lingering uneasiness after 40 years of cold war, a complex system has been established for the Russian role in the Bosnian peacekeeping operation.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The political mood remained angry and bitter today as President Boris N. Yeltsin struggled to declare victory in the smoldering Chechen hostage crisis.</p> <p>With one exception.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>A Turkish ferry seized by hijackers who support the anti-Russian rebels in Chechnya approached Istanbul today, with the hijackers seeming to pull back from threats to blow up the vessel along with themselves and more than 200 passengers.</p> <p>The situation remained highly volatile, however, with several of the hijackers giving contradictory interviews to Turkish news organizations. High seas and thick fog slowed the ferry, and Turkish coast guard vessels shadowed it as it made its way slowly along Turkey's Black Sea coast, headed for Istanbul.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>More than 200 passengers aboard a Turkish ferry that was hijacked this week finally set foot on land today, but the episode seemed likely to cast a shadow over the region for some time to come.</p> <p>Relations between Turkey and Russia, the giant neighbor to the north, deteriorated during the week as their leaders sought to instruct each other about how to resolve domestic crises.</p>
['espionage']	<p>The two parties in Poland's governing coalition failed today to choose a successor to Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy, who announced on Wednesday that he would resign over allegations that he had spied for Moscow.</p> <p>But the leaders of the parties said that they would continue talking and that they planned to maintain their sometimes uneasy alliance.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>In the most vivid display yet of his disenchantment with economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin chose a Soviet-schooled industrialist today to serve  as Russia's top economic official.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin announced that Vladimir V. Kadannikov, the director of Russia's largest and ailing automobile company and an advocate of protective tariffs, would replace Anatoly B. Chubais, the free-market crusader, as Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia today gave Chechen rebels a Sunday morning deadline to release more than 100 hostages but offered them safe passage home if they freed their captives and gave up their weapons.</p> <p>Mikhail Barsukov, director of the Federal Security Service, told Interfax and Itar-Tass news agencies that the guerrillas had been given until 10 A.M. Sunday  (2 A.M. Eastern time) to free their captives in this southern Russian village.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The men moved in tense groups through this tiny hamlet shortly after midnight. "The Russians are going to gas us," their leader, Tarzan Etiyev said,  waking foreign journalists early this morning to warn them of an imminent attack on this Chechen settlement in the Russian republic of Dagestan. "They have agreed with the Dagestanis to kill us."</p> <p>There was no such agreement -- nor reason to believe there ever would be one. There was no attack, and this town only a mile from where Chechen rebels, surrounded by Russian troops, are holding more than 100 hostages survived another tense night on Friday.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>As top specialists from the International Monetary Fund complete a painstaking review of Russia's eligibility for critical foreign loans, President Boris N. Yeltsin has embarked on a pre-election promising spree that economists  say casts new doubt on his commitment to economic discipline.</p> <p>Experts whose assessment may determine Russia's access to $9 billion in new Western lending are worried that Mr. Yeltsin's budget-busting promises -- if he  keeps them -- could undermine the country's market reforms by igniting inflation, according to economists familiar with the deliberations.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, after meetings today with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, expressed their confidence in Russia's continuing commitment to market reform despite Moscow's dismissal of well-known reformers and new plans for large social expenditures.</p> <p>Since the Russian Communist Party did so well in December elections for the lower house of Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin, expected to seek re-election in June, has been moving to co-opt the Communist policy agenda and ridding his Government of ministers associated with Western-style reform.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In an audacious repetition of one of Russia's worst military humiliations, a  band of Chechen rebels stormed a large hospital in the center of this southern Russian city on Tuesday, taking an estimated 2,000 hostages, leaving scores dead and promising to leave only when Russian troops withdraw from Chechnya.</p> <p>"We can turn this city to hell and ashes," the commander of the raid, Salman  Raduyev, declared in an interview broadcast Tuesday night by Russian television. Mr. Raduyev is married to the niece of Dzhokar Dudayev, leader of the Chechen separatists.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin today nominated Yevgeny M. Primakov, director of Russia's foreign intelligence service and a member of the powerful Russian Security Council, to replace Andrei V. Kozyrev, the President's longtime Foreign Minister. Mr. Kozyrev was ousted on Friday after prolonged criticism that he was too accommodating to the West.</p> <p>In choosing the 66-year-old Mr. Primakov, Mr. Yeltsin selected an experienced, shrewd and agile bureaucrat who will be taken seriously by the West and probably pass muster with the Communists who dominate the new Russian Parliament and will have to confirm his appointment.</p>
['banks and banking', 'finances', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>In a vast ballroom of the Noga Hilton in Geneva in October, directors of Russia's largest private bank, Oneksim Bank, celebrated the opening of their Swiss affiliate over caviar and chilled Russian vodka.</p> <p>Oneksim Bank, which was founded in 1993, is the only Russian commercial bank  to have met the starchy conditions of the Swiss Central Bank, a feat so challenging that a financial reporter in Moscow likened it to "me flying to the  moon." Almost as if feting a lunar landing, Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, sent the bankers an effusive congratulatory telegram.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>It began with hundreds of armed men crawling in the fading moonlight across the frozen vineyards of Dagestan. It has not yet truly ended.</p> <p>But the deadly guerrilla attack on the Central Kizlyar Hospital just before dawn on Jan. 9 and its grisly resolution on Thursday in the flames of the tiny village of Pervomayskoye have already driven Russia into deep moral and political despair.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Austria's leadership demanded today that the United States supply details of  79 secret American arsenals that remain scattered across Austria more than 40 years after they were hidden in case of a Soviet invasion.</p> <p>The American Ambassador to Austria, Swanee Hunt, told Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on Saturday that the United States had stockpiled the weapons as an occupation power in the early 1950's without notifying the Austrian Government.</p>
['espionage', 'biographical information']	<p>In one of Poland's most significant political moments since the fall of Communism, Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy announced his resignation in a televised  speech tonight, declaring he was innocent of allegations that he had spied for Moscow for more than a decade.</p> <p>Hours earlier, Poland's military prosecutor had said he was opening an investigation into reports that Mr. Oleksy had "passed information to foreign intelligence." The prosecutor, Slawomir Gorzkiewicz, said his inquiry would also focus on two Russian diplomats who served in Poland and are acknowleged to have  been senior K.G.B. officers.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Distancing himself from the economic reforms that are the hallmark of his presidency, President Boris N. Yeltsin today accepted the resignation of Anatoly B. Chubais, a pillar of economic reform and the last liberal in his increasingly hard-line Cabinet.</p> <p>Mr. Chubais, 40, the Deputy Prime Minister who supervised the stabilization of the Russian economy and planned its privatization program, said he was leaving because Mr. Yeltsin had criticized his work. At a news conference tonight, Mr. Chubais, a beacon of free-market reform to the West, warned that any change of economic course before the presidential elections in June would be a "monstrous mistake."</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>As a band of vastly outgunned Chechen separatists held off thousands of Russian troops in the smoldering remains of a settlement near here for a third day, Chechen militants widened their campaign of hostage-taking against Russia on Tuesday, commandeering a Black Sea ferry and, reportedly, abducting the staff of a Russian electrical station.</p> <p>In the Turkish seaport of Trebizond, masked Chechen gunmen hijacked a Russia-bound ferry with 120 passengers and 45 crew members, and set out for the  Bosporus, threatening to blow up the vessel with all aboard in the busy straits  off Istanbul, according to news agency reports monitored here.</p>
['espionage']	<p>President Aleksander Kwasniewski met with opposition leaders today on a plan  to assemble a new Government after Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy, under investigation for allegedly passing state secrets to Moscow, submitted his resignation.</p> <p>The leading opposition party, Freedom Union, proposed forming a government of technicians rather than politicians. But the proposal was criticized by the governing parties, the Democratic Left Alliance and the Peasants Party.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Ordinarily, when a former columnist makes it to the top in politics, I get a  warm feeling. But the emergence of Yevgeny Primakov as Russian Foreign Minister  should send a chill throughout the West.</p> <p>Boris Yeltsin's choice of the amiable snake who headed his espionage agency signals the end of Mr. Nice Guy in Russian diplomacy. But the change amounts to  far more than a tactical shift to help Yeltsin in coming elections.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Conceding that they have failed in their attempts to rescue scores of hostages from a small band of Chechen guerrillas in the village of Pervomayskoye near here, the Russian Army today withdrew its soldiers from the battleground and began flattening the hamlet with devastating missiles.</p> <p>Faced with the mounting embarrassment of the hostage siege here -- and two more it has spawned in Turkey and in the secessionist republic of Chechnya -- President Boris N. Yeltsin evidently decided after two days of a fierce but futile ground assault to resort to the sheer immensity of his aerial and artillery power to demolish the stubborn rebels.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Senior Administration officials, once invariably chipper about President Boris N. Yeltsin, are taking a markedly more shaded and wary tone about him these days.</p> <p>After the strong Communist showing in Russia's parliamentary elections last month and Mr. Yeltsin's second episode of heart disease, American officials are  expressing considerable concern about the presidential election scheduled for June and the chance that pro-reform candidates will fail to unite behind a single candidate.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>His health is shaky, his popularity and public credibility are in free fall,  and his Communist opponents have never been stronger. President Boris N. Yeltsin, 65, says he will probably run for re-election next June.</p> <p>Even though he remains Russia's most powerful anti-Communist figure, very few democrats or reformers in Russia are celebrating. Mr. Yeltsin says he would run  to prevent Communists from reversing the democratic achievements of his presidency. But as he prepares his campaign, it is sometimes hard to tell who will be more Soviet-minded -- the Communists who want to replace him, or Mr. Yeltsin, struggling to keep them at bay.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's humiliation at the hands of Chechen guerrillas deepened further today, when the leader of the hostage raid of the last 10 days emerged from seclusion to ridicule his enemies and promise that the fight would continue.</p> <p>"They call us bandits but we are not bandits," Salman Raduyev told Reuters in an interview in an undisclosed location near his home town of Novogroznensky in  the secessionist republic of Chechnya. "We are Allah's warriors fighting for our independence."</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration is scrambling to fend off accusations that it cannot verify whether Moscow is cheating on a deal that was central to ending the cold war -- the purchase by the United States of enriched uranium from thousands of Russian nuclear warheads.</p> <p>The doubts center on whether the Russians are indeed dismantling weapons, as  agreed, or are supplying the uranium from other sources, like stockpiles or continued production.</p>

['united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States Ambassador, Swanee Hunt, handed over an envelope today giving the location and contents of 79 arms caches the Americans set up in Austria in the early 1950's.</p> <p>The weapons were stockpiled across western Austria -- the zone of American occupation after World War II -- and were meant for anti-Communist partisans in  the event of a Soviet invasion.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'atomic weapons', 'war and revolution']	<p>ASA BASAYEV BELIEVES she saw him. "I remember him because he was very big and a little bit heavy," she said. We were standing on the front steps of the burned-out municipal building in Samashki, a small agricultural town in war-battered western Chechnya, and Basayev, an elderly woman with piercing gray  eyes, was pointing toward the debris-strewn main street. "I saw him passing right by here," she said. I had come to Samashki, or what was left of it, with a small entourage -- a driver, a photographer and a translator -- and a question: What happened to Fred Cuny?</p> <p>At the time of my conversation with Basayev, in early November, it had been seven months since Cuny, perhaps America's preeminent disaster-relief specialist, and three of his colleagues had disappeared in Chechnya -- and nearly three months since the international efforts to find them had been called off. They were presumed dead. The manhunt, one of the most extraordinary in recent times, had not uncovered where they had been killed or why.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Over the past five years, the United States policy of steady engagement with  Russia has paid benefits to the American people. With our help, the Russians have dismantled thousands of nuclear warheads and rocket launchers. Russian troops, having withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states, are serving alongside their NATO counterparts in Bosnia. The United States is now the largest foreign investor in Russia, and bilateral trade has nearly tripled in the past three years.</p> <p>When Secretary of State Warren Christopher meets with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov in Helsinki this week, he will stress America's determination to preserve and, where possible, to deepen and broaden these accomplishments. He will also discuss some issues on which we have differences,  such as Russia's intention to sell nuclear reactors to Iran.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances', 'elections']	<p>Securing a respite from election-year labor unrest, the Russian Government tapped its severely strained budget today to persuade striking miners to go back to work.</p> <p>After rushing money to the miners and assuring them that a hefty $2.2 billion would be allocated to the coal industry this year, Russian officials persuaded the Russian Coal Workers Union to end a two-day strike by about half a million miners.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Russia's war for Chechnya reached a dangerous new impasse today, after more than a thousand peaceful protesters in Grozny, the secessionist republic's capital, were surrounded by special forces army troops.</p> <p>The protesters at the presidential palace -- not guerrillas but ordinary and  often elderly Russian and Chechen civilians sick to death of more than a year of war -- began on Sunday, after local officials decided to permit a peace demonstration.</p>
['elections']	<p>Top Russian officials gave a sympathetic hearing to striking miners today in  a bid to limit the economic fallout at home and to protect President Boris N. Yeltsin's political prospects in the presidential election in June.</p> <p>Vladimir Kadannikov, in his first official act as Mr. Yeltsin's top economic  adviser, promised to act early next week to ease the miners' concerns and end the strike, representatives of the strikers said.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Chechen civilians said today that they had come under fire from Russian forces as they fled the battered town of Novogroznensky and that others had been trapped there, contradicting Russian statements that the assault had been delayed until all civilians had left.</p> <p>The fortified town had served as the headquarters of Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen military commander, and was a main stronghold of secessionist resistance. The Russian military announced today that it seized the town last night after attacking it with airplanes, helicopters, artillery and mortars.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The Senate's ratification of the Start II treaty is supposedly a sign that the United States respects its nuclear disarmament commitments and that it intends to push Russia to do the same. But many in Moscow think the real objective is to disarm Russia as soon as possible.</p> <p>The problem is the American double standard: a demand for disarmament while disrupting the balance of power by pushing NATO's ill-conceived plans to march toward Russia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution']	<p>An explosion ripped through a crowd in Grozny today as besieged protesters in the Chechen capital demanded that Russian troops leave the secessionist republic.</p> <p>The explosion, which killed three people and wounded seven, came as Russian troops tried to quarantine the demonstrators and persuade them to leave.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>When the crowds were summoned to the main stadium in Herat earlier this month, they went as Romans did to the Coliseum, to watch the grim ritual of death.</p>
['television', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>In an election-year skirmish between President Boris N. Yeltsin and the press, the Government has barred Russia's most prominent independent television  network from the Kremlin, the network's editors said today.</p> <p>Journalists from NTV, Russia's only nationwide independent television station, said that the ban on its film crews was prompted by an unflattering broadcast about Mr. Yeltsin and was meant as a warning to them to tone down their criticism.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>A couple of jokes being told by Russian delegates at last week's Davos economic forum bear repeating. One was: What is the difference between an optimist and a pessimist in Russia today? Answer: A pessimist believes that things in Russia can't possibly get any worse. An optimist believes that they can.</p> <p>Count me an optimist about Russia.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>In an interview broadcast today on Russian television, the leader of the Chechen separatists said that the West was backing Moscow's war to keep Chechnya part of Russia and threatened to stage attacks against Western Europe.</p> <p>Dzhokhar Dudayev, interviewed in an undisclosed location in the mountains, said the "Western world" had provided $6 billion to aid Russian "aggression" and added, "when the moment comes, we'll attack not Moscow but Western Europe."</p>
['airlines and airplanes']	<p>Russia and China have secretly concluded a broad agreement to upgrade the Chinese Air Force by completing the long-stalled sale of 72 high-performance SU-27 fighter planes to Beijing as a prelude to licensing the production of Russia's premier supersonic warplane in China.</p> <p>Chinese military leaders have been pressing the Government for some time to finance a major upgrading of air and naval forces. The deal reflects the growing influence of the Chinese military in the competition for scarce budget resources.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a move that raised new questions about President Boris N. Yeltsin's campaign promise to end the war in Chechnya, the Russian military has attacked the main rebel stronghold in the secessionist republic.</p> <p>Gen. Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, the Russian commander in Chechnya, asserted today that as many as 170 rebels had been killed in the attack on Novogroznensky.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In a major election-year boost for President Boris N. Yeltsin, the International Monetary Fund and Russia agreed today on a $10.2 billion loan to carry forward the country's free-market reforms.</p> <p>The loan, second only to the the bailout package for Mexico last year, is linked to a sweeping plan to proceed with privatization, trade liberalization and other critical steps to move Russia toward a capitalist economy.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist candidate for the Russian presidency, has hailed the victory by Patrick J. Buchanan in the New Hampshire primary and told him that they could cooperate to deport American and Russian Jews, the Interfax news agency said today.</p> <p>Mr. Zhirinovsky, whose party is the third largest bloc in Parliament, called  Mr. Buchanan a "brother in arms" and wished him a "convincing victory" in November.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Yevgeny M. Primakov, the new Russian Foreign Minister, said today that Russia continued to desire a close working relationship with the United States and had  no intention of trying to resurrect the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Mr. Primakov, who spoke after two days of meetings here with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, also said Russia would not put into effect any new oil deal with Iraq until the United Nations lifted sanctions against it.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Local police officers backed by Russian troops fired tear gas and guns today  in an attempt to break up a rally of least 1,000 protesters in the center of Grozny, the Chechen capital.</p> <p>But later tonight, the leader of the Russian-backed Government in Chechnya, Doku Zavgayev, said a compromise had been worked out to end the standoff peacefully.</p>
['espionage']	<p>The President of Poland asked a maverick former Communist with strong parliamentary support to form a new Government today and replace Jozef Oleksy, who resigned as Prime Minister last week over allegations that he was a spy for  Moscow.</p> <p>If approved by Parliament, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz (pronounced vlo-JEE-myez tshee-moh-SHEH-veetch) will become Poland's seventh Prime Minister since the fall of the Communist Government in 1989. He now has three weeks to submit a Cabinet to Parliament for approval.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>Next week's negotiations that could lift cold war trade restrictions on Russian firearms have angered some gun-control advocates in Congress, who say the deal could allow importers to flood the American market with millions of inexpensive Russian handguns and rifles.</p> <p>It is not clear how many Russian guns might be imported under the trade deal, but officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have said that as of early 1995 they had received 270 applications for licenses to import from Russia as many as 3 million rifles, 1.2 million handguns and 9 billion rounds of ammunition.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Defying the President they helped bring to power five years ago, nearly half  a million Russian coal miners went on strike today to demand $200 million in unpaid wages.</p> <p>So did one million coal miners in Ukraine, who say they are owed $367 million in back pay.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>The lights are going out all over Russia. Because believers in democracy -- not a majority, but a plurality backed by a free press -- are split into sullen  factions, they may deliver Russia back to Communist or some other form of tyranny.</p> <p>The enemy of reform is its hero of yesteryear. Because Boris Yeltsin and his  Kremlin clique fear personal punishment from left or right should they lose power, they are making it impossible for the center to hold.</p>
['espionage']	<p>A new Prime Minister of Poland and his Cabinet were sworn in today, replacing a Government toppled by allegations that the former Prime Minister passed state  secrets to Moscow.</p> <p>Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz and his 20 ministers formed Poland's seventh Government since Communism fell in 1989.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'atomic weapons', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament']	<p>Plutocrats of the world, you have nothing more to lose in Russia if a Communist is elected President than you do already under the unpredictable incumbent, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>That was the message the Russian Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, brought to business and political leaders from around the globe in this Alpine ski resort over the weekend.</p>
['elections']	<p>Look at those businessmen dancing around that Communist," said an unemployed Russian at the World Economic Forum held at this ski resort every year. "Don't they realize he will doom their investments?"</p> <p>Center of the executive fandango is the global man of the hour, Gennadi Zyuganov, who led the Communist Party to its victory in the parliamentary elections, and who now leads in the race for president of Russia scheduled for June.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Russian soldiers today demolished Chechnya's ruined presidential palace, a potent symbol of Chechen resistance to Russian troops where thousands of demonstrators had gathered last week.</p> <p>After a first blast, one third of the building, which was devastated in fighting last year, slowly collapsed in an enormous cloud of smoke and dust in the center of this Chechen capital. A second blast, even more powerful, destroyed the building's central section, leaving a small part of the palace still standing.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Casting himself as Russia's best hope for protecting democracy and market reforms from a lurch back to the past, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced today that he would seek a second term in the presidential election in June.</p> <p>His declaration amounted to the formal opening of a campaign that, according  to every measure of public opinion, could well bring back to power the Communists Mr. Yeltsin ousted five years ago.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Sounding eerily like the Communists he is battling for control of Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin delivered a somber annual address today that was devoted almost completely to blaming his own Government for the tide of problems that have afflicted the nation since he became its leader.</p> <p>Speaking before a Parliament that has come to be dominated by his Communist and nationalist opponents, the 65-year-old Mr. Yeltsin did not smile once during an hourlong speech in which he seemed more interested in appealing to those disaffected with his presidency than in explaining why the difficult course of reform is the right one for Russia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian forces today shelled the outskirts of a village in Chechnya where separatists have set up a headquarters.</p> <p>The Russian Army said it began the shelling after Chechen rebels fired automatic weapons and grenade launchers on Russian positions outside of the village, Novogroznensky, near the border with Dagestan, wounding one Russian soldier.</p>
['finances']	<p>Stet S.p.A., Italy's state-owned telecommunications company, and the Russian  phone company Svyazinvest are near to renewing negotiations stalled since last December, an Italian official said yesterday.</p> <p>The Italian Foreign Minister, Susanna Agnelli, told Italian journalists after a meeting with Vladimir Kadannikov, the Russian vice premier in charge of  the economy, that both Stet and the Russian Government were ready to renew talks on an agreement for Stet to buy a stake in the Russian company. Stet's plan to buy a $1.4 billion stake in Svyazinvest collapsed at the end of December after Stet said the Russians failed to meet some investment criteria.</p> <p>(Bloomberg Business News)</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'computers and the internet']	<p>The White House is about to take one of the greatest national security gambles since the end of the cold war. To please the computer industry, the Clinton Administration is preparing to send powerful American supercomputers to  Russian nuclear weapons laboratories.</p> <p>The Convex Computer Corporation, a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, wants to send two computers to Arzamas-16, where Moscow's first atomic and hydrogen bombs were built, and another one to Chelyabinsk-70, the center that developed most of Russia's nuclear warheads, including the world's most powerful hydrogen bomb. The three machines, together worth almost $8 million, operate faster than anything now in Russia.</p>

They arrived in a troika drawn by three gleaming white horses.</p> <p>And when they emerged from the Church of St. Michael the Archangel after a Russian Orthodox ceremony, the nationalist politician Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky had simultaneously celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary and kicked off his campaign to become president of Russia.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Russian soldiers searching for mines and bombs swept the central square of the Chechen capital, Grozny, today after demonstrators for independence ended a  tense weeklong standoff.</p> <p>The police said the demonstrators had left in dozens of buses after reaching  what Dovu Zavgayev, the leader of a local Government backed by Moscow, described as a compromise.</p>
['television', 'elections']	<p>Almost immediately after telling voters that he is Russia's best hope for reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin has undercut his re-election campaign message by sparking concerns that he is trying to muzzle the media.</p> <p>The controversy, which has dominated political news here for the last two days, centers on Russian television, an especially important medium for reaching voters across this vast country.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances', 'space stations', 'space']	<p>The United States will help cash-strapped Russia keep its commitments to the  planned international space station by adding three space shuttle missions, one  to deliver a key Russian component to the station and two to ferry supplies to the existing Mir outpost, NASA officials said today.</p> <p>The officials said United States and Russian negotiators had rejected several Russian proposals designed to reduce its costs of assembling the international station, known as Alpha. But they said the United States had agreed to use shuttles to ferry the supplies to Mir and to place in orbit a Russian science module for Alpha to save Russia the expense of several rocket flights.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>This grim Chechen village looks pretty much like the others strung across the eastern plains here. It is a decimated little farming town surrounded by the Russian Army, which patrols the access roads with tanks, helicopters and hundreds of troops.</p> <p>But there is something unusual going on in Novogroznensky these days. The most wanted men in Russia -- the military and political leaders of this secessionist republic -- stroll about the muddy streets as if President Boris N. Yeltsin had never publicly vowed to hunt them down.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>A month after American-led forces defeated Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, Yevgeny M. Primakov, then a top adviser to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, published a dashing account of his last-ditch efforts to broker a face-saving solution for Saddam Hussein in February 1991 and prevent the ground  war.</p>
['elections']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned Russian voters today that they face a choice in the June presidential elections between inclusion in the institutions of the West or self-isolation.</p> <p>In a speech before the foreign ministers of 12 Central and East European countries, including the three Baltic nations, Mr. Christopher strongly reaffirmed the American commitment to the expansion of NATO no matter what happens in Russia.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The republics of the former Soviet Union cannot account for a large share of  the hundreds of tons of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium once listed in their stockpiles, creating a "primary national security concern for the United States," Government investigators are warning in a new report.</p> <p>The investigators say that the nuclear material is an easy target for smugglers and terrorists, given the lax security procedures at scores of civilian and military nuclear sites throughout the former Soviet Union, and that the United States has little ability to track the material if it is stolen.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Clinton Administration has begun an unusually high-level effort to settle the bitter war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave of ethnic Armenians in  Azerbaijan, and to help make the region safe for oil development, American officials said today.</p> <p>The deputy national security adviser, Sandy Berger, and the Deputy Secretary  of State, Strobe Talbott, have been dispatched to Azerbaijan and Armenia for talks this week.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'elections']	<p>Three of the world leaders who gathered at Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt -- Shimon  Peres, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton -- are actively campaigning to remain in office. It is as if they were running mates on an international incumbency ticket, with each having an intense interest in helping the others win.</p> <p>Can these three political musketeers bring it off together? Or will the weakness of any one of them help drag down the other two?</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'taxation']	<p>Russia has dropped a plan for a sharp across-the-board increase in import tariffs, clearing the way for a $10.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, Western economists said tonight.</p> <p>The election-year loan had been thrown into doubt earlier this month after Russia's Finance Minister, Vladimir G. Panskov, proposed a 20 percent increase in the tariffs, contradicting previous assurances to the I.M.F.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a searing new humiliation for President Boris N. Yeltsin, hundreds of rebels rode into the capital of secessionist Chechnya on a captured freight train today and mounted the biggest battle the war-ravaged city has seen in more than a year.</p> <p>The streets of Grozny rang throughout the day with mortar and machine-gun fire as the vastly outnumbered rebels seized several sections in the south of the city, killing dozens of Russian soldiers, wounding scores more and forcing many others to flee. The battle raged into the night, according to Russian military officials and television news reports from the scene, as both sides dug into the blasted ruins of the city.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>Senator Bob Dole called today for the resurrection of plans to build a national missile defense system by 2003. The system would cost billions of dollars and would violate a treaty on anti-ballistic missiles between Washington and Moscow.</p> <p>Mr. Dole, Speaker Newt Gingrich and other leading Congressional Republicans introduced a bill today to build such a system in seven years, saying it was vital to the nation's defense.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Last month Gennadi A. Zyuganov, presidential candidate and leader of the Communist Party, was the urbane, jolly statesman who impressed a worldly gathering in Switzerland with his talk of pluralism and business know-how.</p> <p>But this week Russians are seeing a different Mr. Zyuganov, belligerent and defensive. Even as he paints himself as a coalition candidate bound to defend the interests of non-Communist voters, his campaign is mired in accusations that his party harbors a "secret plan" to restore repressive Soviet-style rule and centralized economic management.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market']	<p>When President Clinton flew to Egypt two weeks ago, he met with some 30 world leaders to discuss Middle Eastern terrorism, and with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to talk about Bosnia, NATO, their re-election campaigns and bilateral annoyances -- including chicken parts.</p> <p>According to an official and classified American memorandum of the conversation, Mr. Yeltsin made a direct request to Mr. Clinton for support in his campaign, and Mr. Clinton promised to concentrate on creating a "positive impact" on American-Russian relations. Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Yeltsin for help in clearing up "negative" issues between the countries, including the chicken impasse.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A Turkish waiter hoping to win sympathy for the Chechen revolt in Russia used fake weapons to hijack a Turkish Cypiot airliner to Germany but freed his hostages and gave himself up this morning.</p> <p>He took over the Boeing 727 Friday evening during a flight from northern Cyprus to Istanbul and for 11 hours duped Turkish, Bulgarian and German authorities into believing three more armed hijackers were aboard.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After three days of shelling a separatist Chechen stronghold, Russian troops  were reported today to be "mopping up" the region, but an official said that fighting might continue around the town for days.</p> <p>The town, Bamut, and other villages that the Russians say harbor rebel fighters have come under renewed attack in recent weeks.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>The wheels of democracy were moving about as fast as molasses at the monthly  session of the Tula Land Reform Committee. There was a lot of talk about tractor repair and tax laws. There were farmers wondering about when to plant the spring grain, and whether the Government was going to give them any money to do it.</p> <p>Then they got to the item that Russia has been waiting for -- in vain -- for  centuries.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>About 15,000 people, many waving red-and-white Belarussian flags, marched through downtown Minsk today to demand continued independence and protest Government moves to form a political, cultural and economic union with Russia.</p> <p>At one point, demonstrators shouting anti-Government slogans broke through a  police cordon. Scuffles broke out between the police and marchers who pelted them with snow and ice.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Heavy fighting erupted at dawn today near a village in western Chechnya when  Russian troops were ambushed by separatist guerrillas, forcing civilians to flee after the town was shelled in retaliation.</p> <p>Russian television showed men, women and children leaving on foot, in cars and in open wagons as Russian armored vehicles and trucks streamed by and helicopter gunships hovered overhead.</p>
['foreign investments', 'international trade and world market', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Senate moved today to punish the Cuban Government for its downing of two  American private aircraft last month, passing legislation that would tighten the embargo on American trade with Cuba and punish other countries that insisted on  continuing trade on their own.</p> <p>The vote, on the final compromise version of legislation first approved by the House and Senate last fall, was 74 to 22. The compromise now goes to the House, which is expected to approve it later this week.</p>
['public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Revising Soviet history as he goes, the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov  made his first presidential campaign swing today, trying out his election pledge to preserve pluralism and private property on mostly Communist crowds in the distant provinces.</p> <p>Mr. Zyuganov has been accused of talking like a social democrat to non-Communist audiences and like a hard-line Communist to the party rank and file. Out here on the stump in southern Siberia, he is crafting a message that justifies modest economic liberalism by rooting it in the Soviet past, mixing in familiar slogans and references to Lenin and Stalin meant to reassure the old guard.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The International Monetary Fund said today that it had approved a $10.2 billion loan for Russia. The move is expected to be helpful to President Boris N. Yeltsin in the presidential election in June.</p> <p>The three-year loan is the fund's second biggest, after a $17.8 billion credit granted to Mexico last year. It is designed to help Russia along the road from Communism to capitalism.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in his third meeting in six weeks with President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, lashed out at Russia's lower house of Parliament for adopting a nonbinding resolution last week declaring the dissolution of the Soviet Union illegal.</p> <p>In the sharpest comments yet by an American official about the growing imperialist mood of a Parliament now dominated by Communists and nationalists, Mr. Christopher called the vote "highly irresponsible."</p>
['banks and banking', 'finances', 'biographical information']	<p>Gunmen fired shots on Monday night into the apartment of the head of the Russia's Central Bank, the police said today. It was the first time in recent memory that such a high-ranking Government official has been threatened.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Lieut. Col. Jeff Hammond, the commander of the 429th Field Artillery, First Armored Division, peered into the empty hatch of a Russian armored personnel carrier.</p> <p>"You airdrop soldiers while they are inside the vehicle?" the American said incredulously to the Russian commanding officer. "You're kidding!"</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Small groups of Chechen rebels battled Russian troops in Grozny today as the  separatists continued their retreat from the city, but Russia's Interior Minister, Anatoly Kulikov, admitted that their assault had caught his troops off guard.</p> <p>Mr. Kulikov accused both Russian troops and the Moscow-backed Chechen police  officers of "outrageous negligence" in allowing the rebels to attack last week and poor coordination in fending it off.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Carefully sidestepping his party's most divisive positions, Russia's Communist presidential candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, unveiled an election program today that is fashioned to appeal to a broad coalition of voters.</p> <p>Though his nine-point program -- a vague, airbrushed version of his party's platform -- is fiercely populist and anti-free market, Mr. Zyuganov avoided using such hot-button terms as "nationalization," "Communism" or even "Soviet Union."</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>In its most direct challenge yet to the authority of President Boris N. Yeltsin, Parliament voted overwhelmingly today to denounce the 1991 accord that  led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The resolution has no legal significance because the Parliament is weak and the President -- who called the legislation "nonsense" -- can prevent its wishes from becoming law. Nonetheless the measure, which passed by a vote of 250 to 98  in the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament, increased fears about what will happen if the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, becomes President this summer.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The leaders of Russia and Belarus agreed today to form a "union state" which, while it would not quite merge the Governments of the two Slavic nations, would  nevertheless tie them to each other economically, politically and culturally.</p> <p>Such a plan has long been discussed, particularly in Belarus, where it has been eagerly sought.  But the speed and timing of the decision clearly grows mostly from election-year politics in Russia, where the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament voted last week to denounce the 1991 accord that led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.</p>
['elections']	<p>Two months after he was abruptly forced out of office by President Boris N. Yeltsin, one of Russia's leading economic reformers has thrown his support behind the Russian leader.</p> <p>The economist, Anatoly B. Chubais, a free-market advocate and former Deputy Prime Minister, said today that he had decided to support Mr. Yeltsin because he has the best chance to stop Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist candidate, from coming to power.</p>
['elections']	<p>After a week of warning Russians that a vote for the Communists could isolate them from the rest of Europe, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in Moscow today, tried to give a gentle boost to the re-election chances of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>In an hourlong meeting with Mr. Yeltsin this morning, Mr. Christopher stressed the positive, workmanlike, constructive side of the United States-Russian relationship, his aides say, and touched not at all on major sore points, like NATO expansion and the ongoing warfare in Chechnya.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Poor countries usually do a bit of groveling and a lot of kicking and screaming when they negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, needing the  loans the organization provides but resenting the demands for austerity that accompany its help.</p> <p>The pattern seemed different, though, as the fund negotiated and then reached agreement on a three-year, $10.2 billion loan package with Russia last month, raising questions about whether Moscow was getting special treatment.</p>
['elections']	<p>In a quest for political resurrection, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last leader  of the Soviet Union, said he will be a candidate in the presidential elections in June if democrats fail to unite behind a single candidate.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'social conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'finances']	<p>Contradicting assurances made to the International Monetary Fund only a week  ago, Russia's Finance Minister has proposed a broad increase in import tariffs.</p> <p>The plan, which would raise tariffs by an average of 20 percent, appears intended to boost the political fortunes of President Boris N. Yeltsin by raising revenue for new social spending. It could also placate angry farmers and industrialists hurt by foreign competition.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>An increasingly desperate President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that, "as of  this afternoon, everything in Grozny is calm," even as Chechen rebels rampaged again through the secessionist capital, destroying water lines, gas depots and heating supplies while taking control of as much as a third of the city.</p> <p>Russian commanders, afraid of running short of ammunition, pleaded on open radios for increased air support and reinforcements as the battle intensified, with hand-to-hand combat reported only several hundred yards from the heavily fortified main Government administration building in Grozny, the capital.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Russia today endorsed a global treaty to ban underground nuclear tests, but stopped short of supporting the West's goal of banning even the tiniest release  of nuclear energy.</p> <p>"Russia has been consistently in favor of a complete and general nuclear test ban," the Russian delegate, Grigory Berdennikov, said in his first speech this year to the 38-member forum.</p>
['elections']	<p>Just days after welcoming leaders from major industrial nations to Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin arrived in Beijing today for three days of high-profile meetings that both he and President Jiang Zemin of China appear to  view as a chance to play to important constituencies at home.</p> <p>With the Russian presidential election less than two months away, Mr. Yeltsin has sought opportunities to demonstrate his stature as a statesman and display his vigor, no small concern for a 65-year-old candidate with a heart ailment.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>Chechen rebels mourned their fallen leader today and vowed to carry on the fight against Russian forces for independence for Chechnya, the secessionist republic in southern Russia.</p> <p>After a night of rumors and flatly contradictory reports, a senior rebel commander said today that the Chechen insurgents had confirmed that Dzhokhar M.  Dudayev, the rebel leader, had been killed in a Russian rocket attack.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'elections', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Boris Yeltsin's announcement on Sunday of a cease-fire in Chechnya  should be met in the United States with the same skepticism that greeted it in Russia. Several cease-fires have preceded it, and all were brief.</p> <p>The Chechen secession is anathema to the generals conducting the war and to Mr. Yeltsin. The Soviet Union's defeat in Afghanistan in the 1980's was humiliating, but to admit failure in a republic the size of Connecticut within Russia's borders is almost unthinkable. Thus, Mr. Yeltsin's peace plan is likely little more than a campaign tactic, to be quickly forgotten if he wins re-election on June 16.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The White House sought today to rebut senior House Republicans about newspaper allegations that President Clinton tried to strike a deal with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to benefit Arkansas poultry producers.</p> <p>The House Republicans suggested in a letter to the White House that an agreement lifting Russian trade barriers on American poultry was tainted by domestic politics. They sought classified memorandums that they said might demonstrate a quid pro quo between the leaders, designed to help one another's re-election chances.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops attacked two villages in southeastern Chechnya today in an effort to drive rebel forces out of their mountain strongholds.</p> <p>Details were sketchy. But the Itar-Tass news agency, quoting the federal command, said the Russians attacked the villages of Vedeno and Dargo, two important bases for fighters loyal to the separatist leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The widow of the slain Chechen rebel leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, is planning a peace mission to Moscow to try to stop fighting in the secessionist region.</p> <p>The widow, Alla Dudayeva, 49, said she wanted to meet President Boris N. Yeltsin, adding that forces working for a Communist victory in Russian presidential elections on June 16 were to blame for her husband's death.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The last time a Russian leader came to this city, in May 1989, the streets were clogged with student protesters demanding democracy and China seemed to be  on the brink of cataclysmic political change.</p> <p>The leader, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, was hailed by students camped outside City Hall as the kind of forward-looking man that China  needed to abandon its outdated ideology and rescue dilapidated cities like Shanghai.</p>
['public opinion', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin emerged from a meeting in the Kremlin today effusively celebrating the American-Russian partnership even as they glossed over a host of policy differences.</p> <p>They announced some progress on disputes over treaties on conventional forces and anti-missile defenses. And both men put a premium on keeping the relationship between the United States and Russia on a solid footing despite growing anti-Western sentiment in Russia and a coming presidential election here that could well return a resurgent Communist Party to power.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Bill Clinton got a taste of Communism Lite today.</p> <p>In a meeting of 12 Russian political figures, the Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, told the American President that his victory in the coming  presidential elections would not mean a return to the Soviet totalitarian past. In a lengthy soliloquy, Mr. Zyuganov said he supported political pluralism, a mixed economy and freedom of speech, assurances that left his rivals around the table squirming and rolling their eyes.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>On his first trip to Russia, former Vice President Dan Quayle discovered that the friendship between this country and the United States is beginning to fray.</p> <p>Mr. Quayle, who now lectures and writes a syndicated column, delivered a buoyant speech today about democracy and the future of nuclear security to the Russian Academy of Sciences. But his elderly, distinguished audience of mostly sociologists and historians wanted to teach him a thing or two about international relations.</p>
['elections']	<p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev qualified today to be listed on the ballot for Russia's  presidential election in June.</p>
['elections']	<p>It has been a long time since President Boris N. Yeltsin has had a week this  good. He started it last Sunday by announcing a peace plan for Chechnya and he ended it late this afternoon, telling 2,000 core supporters, "We will win in June so that Russia can never be called an evil empire again."</p> <p>In between, he set off with a fistful of promises to Communist-dominated southern Russia and watched with delight as his once anemic ratings in opinion polls edged within striking distance of his main opponent in the presidential race, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'elections']	<p>If the leaders of the world's richest countries had the slightest doubts about what has been on President Boris N. Yeltsin's mind lately, they disappeared Friday night at a sumptuous private dinner at the Kremlin Grand Palace.</p> <p>Squirming in their seats as they washed down their fish pasties, black caviar, stuffed pike and wild goose with fine wine and Russian vodka, seven heads of state listened to Mr. Yeltsin deliver a rambling 45-minute monologue on himself and his prospects for re-election this June.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>A day before his one-on-one meeting with Boris N. Yeltsin, President Clinton  today urged Russia to stay on the path of democratic and economic reform. But he declined to state his preference in the Russian presidential election, which could return a resurgent Communist Party to power.</p> <p>Pressed about the June Russian presidential election at a news conference after the close of a meeting on nuclear security, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Yeltsin as a leader who had helped to reduce the nuclear threat remaining from the cold war. But he quickly added, "It is not right for the United States or for any other country to tell people how they should vote."</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'elections']	<p>Concluding their summit meeting, President Boris N. Yeltsin and the leaders of major industrialized nations called today for a speedy enactment of a nuclear test ban and announced measures to stop the smuggling of nuclear bomb ingredients.</p> <p>But the session was also noteworthy for its warm embrace of the embattled Mr. Yeltsin, who is running for re-election in June, although President Clinton was  careful not to declare his preference for Mr. Yeltsin openly. [Page 10.]</p>
['elections']	<p>In his embattled bid for re-election, President Boris N. Yeltsin has raised the red flag. Literally.</p> <p>Bowing to the growing nationalism and nostalgia for Soviet power fueling the  Russian presidential elections, Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree this week restoring the red banner, embossed with a gold star instead of the Communist hammer and sickle, as a national emblem.</p>
['espionage']	<p>An investigation into whether former Prime Minister Jozef Oleksy spied for Moscow has been closed because of insufficient evidence, a military prosecutor said today.</p> <p>"I have no basis today to present charges to Oleksy," Col. Slawomir Gorzkiewicz, who headed the invesitgation, said at a news conference.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Just a week after Russian forces killed the separatist Chechen leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, Russian news reports said that the rebel chief's successor  had died at the hands of his comrades.</p> <p>There were conflicting reports about the death of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who  succeeded Mr. Dudayev as the leader of Chechen rebels, and one report said he was still alive. None of the reports could be independently confirmed and none quoted rebels or offered details of his death.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'elections', 'credit']	<p>Russia got up to seven years' more breathing space today on repaying more than $40 billion of the accumulated debt it owes to foreign governments, possibly giving another lift to President Boris N. Yeltsin's prospects for re-election this summer.</p> <p>Russian negotiators went into talks with 18 creditor nations here on Thursday asking for a rescheduling plan that would give them up to 25 years to pay off the credits, seven more years than the creditors' group has ever given before.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>In a bid to compete with the rebounding re-election campaign of President Boris N. Yeltsin, two major rival candidates, a Harvard-trained economist and a  nationalist general, said today that they were negotiating an improbable political alliance.</p> <p>Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a popular reform-minded economist, and Aleksandr I. Lebed, a former general with a strong following among conservatives alarmed by the unruly new order, said in separate interviews today that they were involved  in intensive negotiations to merge their political fortunes.</p>
['elections', 'public opinion', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Here are the latest poll figures on the Russian election to be held, the world hopes, in June: Gennadi Zyuganov, the Communist leader, 20 percent; Boris  Yeltsin, non-conqueror of Chechnya, 15 percent; Grigory Yavlinsky, the democratic reformer, 11 percent. A handful of others, including the nationalist wild man Vladimir Zhirinovsky, are in single digits. That means nearly half the electorate is undecided.</p> <p>In the next two months, the figures for the leading three will rise. After Election Day, two will be left, to confront each other in a runoff. Most analysts believe that the Communist, who can claim a hard core of dissatisfied pensioners and old apparatchiks, will be one. The big question is: Who will be the other?</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>If Boris N. Yeltsin is re-elected President of Russia in June, he will owe his victory in some part to one of Washington's least-known but most powerful people: Michel Camdessus.</p> <p>The 63-year-old Frenchman is head of the International Monetary Fund, the obscure global lending organization that gave a vital lift to Mr. Yeltsin's campaign when it formally approved a $10.2 billion loan to Russia last Tuesday.</p>
['treaties', 'crime and criminals']	<p>A Russian news agency found out today that jokes about the old Soviet Union are not so funny to the people of Eastern Europe, even on April Fools' Day.</p> <p>Itar-Tass, which traditionally runs a few gag items on April 1, reported today that Russia's Parliament was considering a revival of the Warsaw Pact, the old Soviet military alliance that once included Eastern European countries.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'credit', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In a stark expression of what they hope to achieve if they take back power, Communist members of Parliament have prepared a draft law that calls for heavy state intervention in the economy.</p> <p>The proposed law would curtail pro-market reforms and rejects some key measures Russia has adopted at the insistence of the International Monetary Fund, which recently granted Russia a $10.1 billion loan.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>When the luncheon conversation at Syria's Presidential palace turned to the subject of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the American guest and his Syrian host could not have disagreed more sharply.</p> <p>The guest, former President George Bush, praised Mr. Gorbachev for his courage in opening the closed Soviet system to internal criticism and to accommodation with old foes. The host, President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, said Mr. Gorbachev had made a historic mistake.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>The first steps in executing a new international agreement to control trade in conventional weapons have been slowed by Russia, which wants to limit the agreement.</p> <p>Delegates from 31 countries, including the United States, convened here on Tuesday for what was to have been the first plenary session to form a group to supervise the agreement, define its duties, appoint a secretariat and discuss sources for its budget.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'finances', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a secret project reminiscent of the chilliest days of the cold war, Russia is building a mammoth underground military complex in the Ural Mountains, Western officials and Russian witnesses say.</p> <p>Hidden inside Yamantau mountain in the Beloretsk area of the southern Urals,  the project involves the construction of a huge complex served by a railroad, a  highway and thousands of workers.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia pulled out two battalions from the mutinous republic of Chechnya today as a part of President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest peace plan, but fighting continued and the rebels shot down a helicopter, killing four Russian soldiers.</p> <p>Russian television said the units withdrew from bases in the Sholkovskoi district, about 100 miles northeast of the regional capital of Grozny, and were  heading back to barracks in Siberia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The fate of the leader of the rebellion in Chechnya became an urgent riddle tonight after a senior Chechen official said that he had been killed earlier this week in a Russian rocket attack.</p> <p>But no sooner was the death of the rebel leader, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, announced, a funeral date reported and a successor appointed than Mr. Dudayev's  death was flatly denied by another top Chechen aide.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, campaigning today at the site of one of the deadliest incidents of the Chechen conflict, pledged to crush "terrorism" in Chechnya with a mixture of force and negotiation.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's electioneering took him to Budyonnovsk, the southern Russian city where guerrillas took hundreds of hostages last June. He arrived hours after separatist rebels ambushed a Russian troop convoy in Chechnya, killing 26  servicemen and wounding 51.</p>
['elections']	<p>Struggling to end the deeply unpopular Chechen war before pivotal elections in June, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that all major military operations in the secessionist republic in southern Russia would stop at once.</p> <p>In a speech broadcast to the nation tonight and in comments to journalists after it, Mr. Yeltsin said for the first time that he would approve peace talks  with the main rebel leader, Gen. Dzhokhar M. Dudayev. He also said he was ready  to grant Chechnya almost any new freedom short of Mr. Dudayev's stated goal of total independence.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The mood in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was decidedly somber today even  as President Boris N. Yeltsin announced his plan to bring peace to the devastated region.</p> <p>Many residents here in the war-scarred capital said they believed that the plan offered little chance of ending the republic's rebellion. And both the Russian soldiers stationed here and rebels in southern Chechnya expressed doubt  that Mr. Yeltsin's announcement would bring much change.</p>
['elections']	<p>Traveling on his first campaign trip straight to the Communist-dominated heartland of Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin wandered from pig farms to metal factories today, delivering the same simple, heartfelt message: the past is over, please don't bring it back.</p> <p>"Do you know how important this election is for Russia?" he asked voters at a town meeting here less that a mile from the site of history's biggest tank battle, where the Red Army broke the Nazi advance. "Do you remember the lines, the lists, the fact that you had no choices? Only democracy can insure the future of our country."</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>After his last trip to Japan three years ago, one dominated by vicious disputes over trade, President Clinton returns on Tuesday to a changed strategic landscape, with Japan seeming a reduced economic threat, and China seeming a larger military one.</p> <p>With Beijing struggling to gain respect as a great power through displays of  military prowess off Taiwan, and North Korea declaring the 1953 armistice between the Koreas dead, Asia appears more fragile, raising new questions about  the American commitment to use its power to enforce the stability required for growth and trade.</p>
['public opinion', 'foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'finances']	<p>At the age of 22, Galina Mardoyan has seen enough turmoil to last a lifetime. By the time she was done with high school, the Soviet Union had collapsed. As an Armenian living in Georgia, she felt despised, so she moved to a resort on the Black Sea, where she hoped to live quietly with her grandmother.</p> <p>She got there in 1992, just in time to watch thousands of her new neighbors in the once glorious vacation town of Sukhumi butcher one another in a savage civil war. She fled again, this time to Moscow, where she is a college student.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'space', 'treaties']	<p>When President Boris N. Yeltsin declared on Thursday, somewhat prematurely as it turned out, that he had persuaded China to sign a treaty banning nuclear weapons testing forever, he was unaware of China's position on the "asteroid threat" and the need for "peaceful nuclear explosions" to combat it.</p> <p>The Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, told Mr. Yeltsin that China favored concluding a treaty this year. On the basis of his statement, Mr. Yeltsin announced what he thought was very good news, especially after President Clinton had personally requested that he try to win Chinese support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Lending disturbing credence to the darkest suspicions of many Russians, President Boris N. Yeltsin's closest confidant called today for a postponement of the presidential election scheduled for June 16.</p> <p>"People must be given time to calmly think about everything and reach a mature conclusion," said Maj. Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, Mr. Yeltsin's security chief, in a rare interview with the Interfax news agency. "For this, more time is needed than we have until June 16. There are entire regions of Russia where the civilized expression of people's will is not yet possible."</p>
['elections']	<p>There are two devils," says Grigory Yavlinsky, the democratic reformer presumably running third in the race for president of Russia. "One is a small devil -- that is Yeltsin. One is a big devil -- that is the Communist Zyuganov."</p> <p>The 44-year-old free-market economist is explaining the dilemma facing Russian voters as they go to the polls June 16. We are on a telephone line being sloppily tapped by the K.G.B. -- a kind of conference call with clicks and sudden drops in volume.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>With one month left before this anguished nation chooses its next President,  public opinion polls -- which have never come close to predicting Russian voting patterns -- are now among the country's principal obsessions.</p> <p>The polls have become so popular and influential, in fact, that they threaten seriously to distort the voting behavior they are supposed to predict.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'elections']	<p>The main event on Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign schedule today was a "meeting with Russian intellectuals," and it gave the Likud Party candidate a chance to try to move away from security issues that have dominated the Israeli campaign.</p> <p>Sitting with about two dozen raptly attentive Russian immigrants, scientists, academics and artists gathered from around the country, the conservative challenger to Prime Minister Shimon Peres bemoaned left-wing domination of Israeli culture.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Eleven days after it claimed to have uncovered a British spy ring, Russia expelled four British diplomats today on accusations of spying and Britain in turn expelled four Russian diplomats, accusing them of espionage.</p> <p>The tit-for-tat evictions, the largest since 1989, were a throwback to the days of the cold war, when both countries mounted major campaigns to obtain secret information and occasionally clashed in rounds of spy-busting and retaliatory busting.</p>
['elections']	<p>Hopes that Russian democrats had of forging a united front against the Communist Party in next month's presidential election suffered badly today when  President Boris N. Yeltsin's main liberal challenger harshly rejected all pleas  that he abandon his long-shot quest for the presidency.</p> <p>For weeks Mr. Yeltsin has been courting Grigory A. Yavlinsky, the popular 44-year-old liberal leader, whose candidacy many people feel can only help the Communists by leeching votes from Mr. Yeltsin on election day, June 16. More than once the President has suggested that a deal was near. More than once Mr. Yavlinsky has responded by simply making new demands.</p>
['finances', 'elections']	<p>Aleksandr Y. Basin took a break from the bustle at the commodities exchange the other day to boast how he had profited from President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election campaign.</p> <p>"I made some money on Yeltsin," he said, a gold chain glistening beneath his  open collar. "I made a contract when Yeltsin was 26 percent and managed to sell  when he was 29."</p>
['elections']	<p>In a surprise move with powerful implications for President Boris N. Yeltsin's effort to win re-election, the Kremlin announced today that Mr. Yeltsin and the leader of the rebels in Chechnya plan to hold talks in Moscow.</p> <p>The announcement, which occurs against the backdrop of bitter fighting in the breakaway Chechen republic, is a high-stakes step for Mr. Yeltsin. The war has dogged him for 17 months, and he has declared that he cannot win re-election without progress toward a peace settlement.</p>
['elections']	<p>Things have suddenly become desperate in the election campaign of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>Polling is a particularly inexact science in Russia. But the Kremlin has become so spooked by private polls that show Mr. Yeltsin still far behind his Communist opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, that it has begun urgent talks with the President's democratic rival, Grigory A. Yavlinsky.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>At a news conference billed as the outlining of the Communist Party's definitive economic program, the economist in charge of formulating it instead spoke spookily this week about attempts by the Yeltsin campaign to tamper with the Russian gene pool.</p> <p>"It's an attempt to modify the genetic code of ethnic Russians who represent  the core of the citizens of Russia, rather than what seems to look like persuasion," the economist, Tatyana I. Karyagina, said. She was apparently alluding to the mass media she said were working on behalf of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Up to 40 Russian troops and 120 separatists were killed today in a fierce battle near Bamut, in western Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.</p> <p>Up to 1,000 rebels have been defending the hills around the village, which lies in ruin, against Russian artillery, tanks and warplanes, a high-ranking Defense Ministry official said.</p>
['elections']	<p>They are worlds apart in so many ways: different countries, different parties, different histories. But Bibi Netanyahu, the head of Israel's right-wing Likud Party, and Gennadi Zyuganov, the head of Russia's left-wing Communist Party, actually have much in common, and you can learn a lot about the predicament of Russia and Israel by comparing the two.</p> <p>To begin with, both Netanyahu and Zyuganov head ideological parties that have been out of power since the early 1990's, and during their absence their respective countries have gone through sweeping revolutions. Since the Communists last ruled, the Soviet Union has collapsed and its authoritarian, central planning regime replaced with a flawed, but free-market democracy. Since the Likud was last in office, Israel has gone from a country in which it was illegal to talk to the P.L.O. to a country that now claims Yasir Arafat as its peace partner.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, released the outline of his economic program today, a plan to revive the economy by having Russia spend its  way out of industrial and agricultural decline and seal itself off from foreign  competition.</p> <p>In sharp contrast to the free-market reforms of President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Zyuganov's proposal, which is centered on tight government control and regulation of the economy, is the most specific he has offered to date. It calls for heavy state spending on industry, particularly the military-industrial complex, as well as on education and medical care. The proposal advocates strict price controls on consumer goods and raw materials and lowering energy prices to stimulate domestic production.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'espionage']	<p>Canada said today that it had detained two suspected Russian spies and begun  deportation proceedings.</p> <p>Solicitor General Herb Gray said the two accused agents had assumed identities that belonged to Canadians who had died in childhood.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'elections']	<p>The other day, Natan Sharansky, the former Soviet dissident, sat in a small classroom at Hebrew University in Jerusalem and listened to a dozen Russian physicists, chemists and engineers vent their dissatisfaction with their new lives as immigrants.</p> <p>Lev D. Bergelson, a biochemist, said the principal complaint was that Israel  had been saturated with scientists -- 10,000 qualified Russian immigrants trained as academics and researchers -- but about 70 percent of them were working as truck drivers, bricklayers and in other jobs outside their fields.</p>
['espionage', 'elections']	<p>In one of the most contentious spy cases since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has accused Britain of running a spy ring and threatened to expel  as many as nine British diplomats.</p> <p>The Russian action, and a British threat to retaliate by expelling Russian officials, was a throwback to the cold war and it served to underline the increasingly nationalist refrains of the campaign for the June presidential election, in which President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Communist candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, have sought to make a virtue of standing up to the West.</p>
['elections']	<p>President Clinton received assurances today from President Boris N. Yeltsin that Russia would move ahead as scheduled with a presidential election in June.</p> <p>The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said the two leaders spoke by telephone for 20 minutes and that Mr. Yeltsin repeated the statements he had made publicly in Russia on Monday, disassociating himself from a call by  his confidant, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, for the election to be postponed.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>Every field of history seems to have its revisionists. Some 15 years ago, for example, a school of German historians began claiming that Hitler in some ways wasn't quite so bad after all. The last few years have seen a curious burst of revisionism about the other great villain of the 20th century, Stalin.</p> <p>An opening salvo came in a 1993 article by three historians in the American Historical Review that said far fewer people were arrested in the Great Purge of the late 1930's than had been previously thought. The authors also claimed to have found records proving that nearly 400,000 prisoners had "escaped" from gulag camps, a claim that would draw a roar of laughter from any camp veteran alive today.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Soviet anthem blared through the loudspeakers. And the old Soviet flag was raised high, as the presidential candidate Gennadi A. Zyuganov sought to use Russia's May Day celebration to tap a wellspring of nostalgia for the Communist  cause.</p> <p>But Mr. Zyuganov was not the only candidate who took to the streets today.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Aleksandr Prokhanov seems too bourgeois to be seditious. He speaks with the ironic detachment of a French intellectual. His hair is straggly and graying. His clothes are elegantly faded.</p> <p>As he muses about the depth and beauty of the Russian soul, it can be easy to forget that Mr. Prokhanov is often seen as one of Russia's most dangerous men -- a fire-breathing anti-Semite whose opposition newspaper, Zaftra, or Tomorrow, has practically called for the violent overthrow of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Chechnya's separatist leader, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, met reporters today to refute reports that he had been killed in a clash with rival rebels.</p> <p>Mr. Yandarbiyev also laid down the same unyielding terms for peace talks with Russia as his predecessor, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, who died in a Russian attack. "The condition for talks is the total withdrawal of Russian troops," he said.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>On a recent visit to Tbilisi, Georgia, Patriarch Aleksy II tipped his hand about the Russian presidential elections. "Today, in this fateful time for Russia, President Boris Yeltsin has played a great role in uniting the people,"  he said at a news conference. "If the old regime comes back to power, the country will suffer new tremors."</p> <p>The Patriarch, who has repeated such warnings elsewhere, is stretching the limits of a church ruling made in March that prohibits clergy from officially campaigning in the presidential election. Aleksy II neither endorsed President Boris N. Yeltsin flat-out nor directly condemned the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, who in his campaign for the Kremlin has promised to respect religious freedom.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The head of a Government commission investigating the ambush of a Russian military column by Chechen rebels last month said today that Russian military officials might be prosecuted for "criminal negligence" for failing to prevent the attack.</p> <p>Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov, speaking on Russian Public Television, said the ambush on April 16 took the lives of 73 servicemen, wounded 52 and left 3 missing. Eight armored vehicles and 20 automobiles were destroyed.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin took a running headstart last week on the election law that  prohibits presidential candidates from advertising on radio, television or billboards before May 15. Beginning Thursday and throughout the long Victory Day holiday, his campaign flooded the airwaves with gauzy television commercials featuring World War II veterans reminiscing fondly about their past and hinting darkly about the future.</p> <p>In one of them, a sad-eyed veteran looks straight into the camera and says wistfully, "I just want my children and grandchildren to finally savor the fruits of the victory we fought for and that they didn't let us enjoy."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he had offered to put Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economist who is Mr. Yeltsin's main liberal challenger, in charge  of Russia's market reforms if he would agree to drop out of the presidential race.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin said that he had proposed the post of Deputy Prime Minister to Mr. Yavlinsky but that Mr. Yavlinsky had wanted more.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>In a vivid display of anxiety over President Boris N. Yeltsin's gains in the  polls, the Communist candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, implored party members today to tone down their remarks about nationalizing private property.</p> <p>Mr. Zyuganov made his unusual appeal at a raucous party meeting, surrounded by signs of open dissent within the Communist ranks and growing concern that the party is losing the initiative to Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>With millions of people still displaced or living as refugees almost five years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, three international agencies will  hold a conference next week in Geneva to address what relief organizations call  a colossal problem largely unnoticed outside the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p> <p>Since the Soviet Union was formally dissolved in 1991, officials say, nearly  nine million people have been uprooted, creating one of the largest and most complex migrations ever faced by international agencies.</p>
['elections']	<p>As a citizen of Estonia and someone who has lived in this graceful capital for 31 years, Mira Trapiseva will not be voting in the Russian election next month. But there is pretty much nothing else on her mind these days.</p> <p>"I worry about it all the time," said Mrs. Trapiseva, a 67-year-old ethnic Russian who sells newspapers on the street to augment her monthly pension. "Some Russians here seem to want the Communists to win because they always talk about  defending us. My husband supports them. But I worry what will happen if they get in. It could be worse for everyone."</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>The re-election of Boris N. Yeltsin promises to be a hard sell in this downtrodden factory town 200 miles northeast of Moscow.</p> <p>The two textile plants in Lezhnevo are idle. The recent voting trend here in the Ivanovo region is strongly anti-Yeltsin. Workers and retirees, dispirited and cynical, are more preoccupied with getting by than with politics.</p>
['elections']	<p>Hoping to stifle growing speculation that he would rather cancel presidential elections than lose them, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that voting would take place in June as scheduled.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin rebuked Maj. Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, his chief bodyguard and closest confidant, who set off a political furor on Sunday by calling for elections to be postponed.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Yuri D. Maslyukov took another puff from his cigarette and smiled about his recent meeting with a senior official from the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>"It was like people from the Hawaiian Islands trying to talk to Eskimos," chuckled Mr. Maslyukov, who is a top adviser to the Communist candidate for President of Russia, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, and is also the chairman of Parliament's Committee for Economic Policy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Prosecutors in the Kremlin-installed Chechen government began an investigation today into a helicopter attack on the outdoor market of a major Chechen town.</p> <p>Helicopters fired rockets into Urus-Martan on Tuesday, killing 5 people and wounding 21, Government officials said.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Moscow showed signs today of backing away from its plan to expel nine British diplomats after Russia accused Britain of running a spy ring, and Russian and British officials said they were working toward a compromise to defuse their dispute.</p> <p>The officials said the solution might be to reduce the number of Britons expelled.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'finances', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>TWO weeks before Russia's second presidential election, market analysts are betting that the incumbent, Boris N. Yeltsin, will emerge as the winner and complete the nation's transition to market capitalism, sending stock values soaring.</p> <p>But even if the prize goes to his principal rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov -- who calls himself a Communist, has criticized President Yeltsin's tough anti-inflation measures, and hinted that he may renationalize some companies --  many of these same analysts feel that in practice he will unable to do much more than temporarily slow the pace of economic change. And that, too, leaves their outlook for the market positive.</p>
['elections', 'war and revolution']	<p>In Red Square, President Boris N. Yeltsin reviewed thousands of soldiers today marching before a giant painting of Marshal Georgi K. Zhukov, the Soviet World War II hero, astride a prancing white stallion, that was hung from the same edifice where Lenin's portrait was once mounted.</p> <p>The Communists brandished a different symbol at another rally to commemorate  the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.Outside the K.G.B. headquarters, the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, addressed his audience  a few yards from a giant portrait of Stalin in military uniform.</p>
['elections']	<p>In his frenetic pursuit of re-election, Boris N. Yeltsin plans 16 campaign trips this month. In April the 65-year-old Russian President's punishing schedule sent him from Moscow to Norway and then across the Asian continent to China. In between, he presided over a hectic summit meeting held for the leaders of the world's richest nations.</p> <p>"I do not have any time to remember my illnesses," Mr. Yeltsin wrote this week in response to a series of personal questions submitted by voters. "I work  from 5 in the morning until late each night."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>After 18 months of a war that has left Chechnya in ruins and imperiled the presidency of Boris N. Yeltsin, leaders of both sides signed a treaty at the Kremlin today intended to end the fighting in the secessionist region in southern Russia on June 1.</p> <p>President Yeltsin has said many times that he would never negotiate directly  with the separatists. But clearly believing that he cannot win the presidential  election next month without making a dramatic new gesture of peace, he decided last week to invite the Chechen leader, Zelim khan Yanderbiyev, to Moscow.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Outwardly at least, Polish officials say they are not panicked but instead are taking a pragmatic view about the prospect of the Communists' winning the Russian election next month.</p> <p>Historically, Poland, of all the Central European nations striving toward NATO membership, has had the most traumatic relationship with Russia and the most to lose if the Russian Communists come to power and upset the planned expansion of the Western military alliance.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Worried by information that China was seeking to buy SS-18 strategic missile  technology from Russia or Ukraine, the United States has recently warned all three countries against such a sale, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today.</p> <p>Senior American officials said there has been no evidence of any completed sales or transfers of SS-18 missiles or components, including guidance canisters or propellant, from either Russia or Ukraine to China. And Russia and Ukraine have said that no transfer occurred.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>The last leader of the Soviet Union stepped out of his car on the edge of his boyhood village on Wednesday and looked expectantly at the small group of people gathered.</p> <p>"So, who is meeting me here?" he asked jovially. He looked closer and frowned as he recognized only Western reporters. "It's mostly foreigners. I want to see  someone I know."</p>
['elections']	<p>Although the leaders of Russia's Communist Party still say they have a chance to win next week's presidential election, they have already begun to portray their candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, as a man who stands to gain as much in defeat as he would in victory.</p> <p>The Communist challenger has not campaigned since the first round of voting on June 16, and he apparently does not plan to travel before the July 3 runoff.  Communist advisers have taken to talking less about how they would govern and more about how difficult they could make things for President Boris N. Yeltsin in their role as parliamentary obstructionists.</p>
['elections']	<p>Boris Yeltsin brought off a shturmoushchina.</p> <p>That's the Russian word for a horse far off the pace who suddenly storms toward the finish line. It also describes a drunken, drugged, stumbling politician who shakes off his lethargy and overwhelms criticism of his sorry record by zestfully demonizing his most dangerous opponent.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>Most voters who went to the polls here today to elect the next Russian President and a new parliament for Chechnya were not happy.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Registering both their fear of the past and a cry for change, Russian voters  on Sunday gave President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Communist opponent, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, enough support to face each other in a runoff election next month that will decide the future of the country.</p> <p>According to preliminary results from 60 percent of the electorate and a nationwide survey of voters leaving the polls, Mr. Yeltsin was leading this morning with about 35 percent, followed closely by Mr. Zyuganov with nearly 32 percent.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>When heavy winter snows blanketed this region just six months ago, President  Boris N. Yeltsin's political prospects looked bleak indeed.</p> <p>Voters in this hard-hit and hotly contested region had made the Government their third choice in parliamentary elections -- behind the strident nationalists of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and the newly resurgent Communists. Anti-Yeltsin bitterness ran deep among workers in the decrepit military factories and chemical refineries of the southern Ural Mountains.</p>
['elections']	<p>A thick, chill fog muddled the masts and cranes of Golden Horn Bay, but inside the Palace of the Sailor, voters of various political stripes clearly shared a common joy on Sunday at exercising their right to elect a President.</p> <p>"It won't be like Brezhnev any more, getting stuck with a President for 17 years," said a 21-year-old Russian Navy sailor.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Mayor of St. Petersburg, a liberal who was an early, close ally of Boris  N. Yeltsin and remains a symbol of Russia's reform movement, narrowly lost his bid for re-election on Sunday to his former deputy.</p>
['elections']	<p>In an elaborate effort to reassure Russian voters that the upheaval in the Caucasus has begun to subside, President Boris N. Yeltsin held an unusual summit meeting today with top leaders from the troubled region.</p> <p>Meeting with the leaders of Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia in an opulent sanitarium in the foothills of the Caucasus, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia would continue to honor the cease-fire in Chechnya despite recent attacks on Russian servicemen there.</p>
['elections']	<p>Is Boris Yeltsin a democrat or an autocrat? Do Russia's Communists intend to  re-Stalinize the country, or have they learned their lesson?</p> <p>Ask many experts what the presidential election on June 16 is likely to produce, and one hears a lot about continuity: Whatever their deepest desires, it seems the Communists, if victorious, will be held in check by the economic transformation that has already taken place. They know that they can't turn back the clock without bloodshed. As for Mr. Yeltsin, whatever promises he makes now, his re-election will only bring the final petering out of reform, along with cronyism and corruption on a vast scale.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>It has been four decades since they carved this gentle haven for scientists from the deep stands of birch and poplar that sweep across the Siberian plain. It was to be a city like no other in the workers' paradise, a place where the unhindered ideals of socialism would fuel the quest for perfect truth.</p> <p>For a while it seemed to work. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who created this science city, spared nothing to make certain that the finest Soviet minds were freed from the worries of the common man. If a researcher needed to fly 3,000 miles to Moscow, he had only to ask for a ticket. Expensive new equipment arrived on every train. As institutes sprouted among the blooming lilacs, thousands of idealistic men and women rushed to fill them.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Central Bank of Russia gave in today to President Boris N. Yeltsin's demand for money to help pay for his campaign promises, agreeing to turn over the equivalent of $1 billion to the Government.</p> <p>The decision was made at a meeting of the bank's board of directors, the Interfax news agency said. Bank officials had earlier protested the demand and threatened to challenge it in court.</p>
['finances', 'elections']	<p>The last two months have been like Christmas in much of Russia. Eager to buy  his way back into the good graces of voters before the election on June 16, President Boris N. Yeltsin has been tossing cash in the direction of nearly every worker, factory director and farm collective he can find.</p> <p>There is, however, at least one major, federally supported enterprise that has not been a beneficiary of Mr. Yeltsin's new largess: the State Hermitage Museum here, this country's pre-eminent cultural institution and one of the world's greatest museums, has not received a ruble from the Government for more  than six months.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'bombs and explosives', 'war and revolution']	<p>Four Russian soldiers were killed today when their armored personnel carrier  hit a mine in Chechnya, and an international mediator met with Russia's military commander in the separatist republic to try to get negotiations back on track after fighting marred the first day of a cease-fire on Saturday.</p> <p>The mediator, Tim Guldimann, the leader of the Chechnya mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, met with the Russian commander, Gen. Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. It said that discussions centered on 26 Russian soldiers the rebels captured on Saturday in the Nozhai-Yurt region southeast of Grozny and on 10 Chechens taken prisoner  by the Russians a day earlier in Shali.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Like many Russians, Vladimir I. Zakharov is reluctant to say who will get his vote in this month's presidential election. But he's quick to declare his conviction that the votes will not be counted fairly.</p> <p>"Whenever cheating is possible, they will do it," the 66-year-old former store manager said. "I am sure the Yeltsin team will cheat whenever it has the opportunity."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Peace talks aimed at ending the war in Chechnya adjourned today without a signed accord, but a rebel spokesman said the two sides had agreed on a Russian  troop withdrawal by the end of August.</p> <p>The talks were scheduled to resume on Monday.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Surrounded by beaver coats, ermine jackets and fox trim hats, Perry Green happily remembered the recent morning here when 13 Russian women walked into his store empty-handed -- and walked out with 15 mink coats.</p> <p>But conversation in his chilly fur vault heated up when the rotund Alaskan furrier looked at the coming presidential elections on the far side of the Bering Strait. Noting that only a year ago he opened another store, at Anchorage's airport, to cater to Russian tourists who come for the variety, quality and low prices they do not find at home, he said: "I don't think the Communists will win. Even if they do, once you have tasted freedom, you can't shut it off."</p>
['elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin had a big problem in Tula before he latched onto Aleksandr I. Lebed. People in that central Russian city -- even those who voted  for him -- dislike Mr. Yeltsin intensely, according to focus groups meeting there on Wednesday, the day after Mr. Lebed, the outspoken former general who came in a strong third in last week's presidential election, was named to the Cabinet.</p> <p>They do not like Mr. Yeltsin's program and they are even more confused about  who should lead Russia into the next century than most of their fellow citizens, as last Sunday's vote suggests: Mr. Yeltsin received 31 percent of the local votes; Mr. Lebed, who represents Tula in parliament, received 29 percent and the Communist candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, got 25 percent.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>In the Kremlin, what goes around comes around, with a vengeance.</p> <p>Anatoly B. Chubais, the campaign adviser who last week triumphantly announced on television that he had helped purge the Kremlin of Boris N. Yeltsin's most hawkish advisers, has been quietly stripped of his direct access to Mr. Yeltsin and told to keep out of the public eye, campaign officials said today.</p>
['elections']	<p>Describing an unsettled world threatened by instability in Russia and the Balkans, Bob Dole opened a new line of attack on President Clinton today, warning that the nation could not endure leadership by "would-be statesmen still suffering from post-Vietnam syndrome." He advocated a harder line in dealing with potentially hostile powers.</p> <p>In what Mr. Dole called a continuing effort to contrast himself with the President on foreign policy, he declared that Mr. Clinton's "misguided romanticism" in dealing with the former Soviet Union had "given a green light to the most dangerous tendencies in the new Russia," as evidenced by the resurgence of Communism there. And seeking to differentiate his views from the Administration's on the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Mr. Dole urged that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic be included in the alliance by 1998. He said the White House's approach to the matter had been "deliberately slow" so as not to stir nationalist forces in Russia seeking to unseat Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian president.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>With the doors of political opportunity creaking shut, the liberal also-ran,  Grigory A. Yavlinsky, has jammed his foot across the threshold, struggling to hold them ajar just a little longer.</p> <p>Mr. Yavlinsky, the most unreservedly democratic candidate in the presidential race, came in a weak fourth in the first round of voting, losing his leverage and much of his popularity to the more conservative Aleksandr I. Lebed.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>In a political purge, President Boris N. Yeltsin today dismissed seven senior generals with ties to the ousted Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev.</p> <p>The dismissals were intended to polish Mr. Yeltsin's image as a reformer and  strengthen the authority of Aleksandr I. Lebed, a former election rival of Mr. Yeltsin who was recently named his national security adviser.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Polina S. Novozhilova, a sinewy cement plant operator, remembers the glory days of working in this seaport: a 30 percent bonus for working in the Soviet Far East and guaranteed grocery supplies to ease life in a "closed city."</p> <p>Today, Russia's Far East is wide open, and Mrs. Novozhilova has a second job, peddling imported Coca-Colas from her new workplace, a sidewalk stand.</p>
['elections']	<p>The old woman on the poster is dressed entirely in black. She is wrapped in the arms of the only person she feels certain can guide Russia safely from the abyss, and a prayer for deliverance brightens her dark eyes.</p> <p>"You are our last hope and support," the campaign ad says, referring to the mournful, empathetic, troubled man to whom she clings.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'medicine and health', 'finances', 'elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin has ordered Russia's Central Bank to transfer the  equivalent of $1 billion to the federal budget in an election-year move that has alarmed economists and created new worries about resurgent inflation</p> <p>Facing a strong Communist challenge in presidential elections just two weeks  away, Mr. Yeltsin said the funds would be used to fulfill campaign promises to teachers, doctors and the military.</p>
['elections']	<p>The world can sigh in relief. Sunday's Russian elections did not reproduce the experience of December 1993, when the party of the chauvinist and anti-Semite Vladimir Zhirinovsky received the largest number of votes for parliament, nor that of December 1995, when the Communists won a plurality. This time, Boris Yeltsin outmaneuvered his opponents.</p> <p>Employing modern campaign techniques and making the most of his control of television, Mr. Yeltsin succeeded in gaining a slender but incontestable edge. He skillfully confronted voters with a stark alternative: either a return to the past or progress toward the future.</p>
['elections']	<p>There is a bizarre quality to some of the recent commentary on the Russian elections. We are treated either to sniping from the left that it doesn't really matter who wins because Boris Yeltsin and Gennadi Zyuganov are both commissars at heart, who in the end will stamp out democracy. Or we are treated to sniping from the right that it doesn't really matter who wins because Boris Yeltsin and Gennadi Zyuganov are both czarists at heart, who in the end will stamp out Russia's neighbors. Enough of this nonsense.</p> <p>You don't have to be an expert on Russia, just have an ounce of common sense, to appreciate that Boris Yeltsin and his predecessor, Mikhail Gorbachev, have transformed the Soviet Union and then Russia in ways that have made the lives of all Americans and millions of others across Europe immeasurably safer and more free. To even feign indifference about the outcome of this Russian election, to  even suggest for a second that it doesn't matter, is foolhardy and reckless.</p>
['elections']	<p>The final round of the Russian presidential election could take place on July 7. Or maybe on July 3. Possibly June 30, though there is also a chance voting could be held on July 14.</p> <p>The most heated political battle going on right now between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Communist rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, is not about whether to roll back economic reform or withdraw troops from Chechnya, but when exactly their fateful runoff should take place.</p>
['ethics', 'crime and criminals', 'elections', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a bold stroke to consolidate support before next month's runoff election,  President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his unpopular Defense Minister today and appointed Aleksandr I. Lebed, a retired general who finished a strong third in Sunday's first round, as his top national security adviser.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's move tightened his grip on first place by giving him a claim to the 15 percent of the electorate who supported the gruff-talking Mr. Lebed in the first round of presidential balloting.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'elections', 'finances']	<p>Having endured crime, a chaotic financial system and an economy that promises better days but has yet to deliver, American and other foreign companies that do business in Russia do not rattle easily.</p> <p>But despite public displays of bravado and a small flurry of new deals in the last few months, big corporations and other international investors have clearly been shaken by the possibility of a Communist victory in Russia's upcoming Presidential elections.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>In a dramatic move seen as a victory for the forces of economic reform and democracy, President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed three senior officials he had long been close to. The three had driven liberals like Anatoly B. Chubais out of the government, strongly supported the war in Chechnya and were accused of urging Mr. Yeltsin to cancel the elections.</p> <p>WINNERS</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Just five months after the Yeltsin Government's foremost proponent of free-market reform was humilated and forced out of office, Anatoly B. Chubais has vanquished his enemies and made a triumphant return.</p> <p>As a top campaign aide to President Boris N. Yeltsin, it was Mr. Chubais who  explained Mr. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his hard-line aides at a news conference broadcast on a state controlled television network. And for months it has been Mr. Chubais who has instilled a sense of strategy and organization into Mr. Yeltsin's previously rudderless election campaign.</p>
['elections']	<p>Seeking to end a bitter power struggle within his campaign and cleanse his tarnished administration before the presidential runoff election 13 days away, President Boris N. Yeltsin today dismissed three of his most powerful and hawkish advisers, including his closest confidant and widely feared security chief.</p> <p>The extraordinary reversal of Kremlin fortunes was played out in a frenzied atmosphere of arrests, midnight phone calls, coup rumors and palace intrigue.</p>
['elections']	<p>Whether he is standing on a tank facing down a coup, as he did five years ago, or dismissing his best friend in the name of saving democracy, as he did today, Boris N. Yeltsin has a gift for political theater that has repeatedly been his own salvation.</p> <p>By banishing three of his closest and least popular aides from the Kremlin today, Mr. Yeltsin has restored an image of decisiveness that had faded during years of ill health and absentee leadership, and thus solidified his prospect in the presidential runoff on July 3.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'elections', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>Struggling to limit the economic damage from President Boris N. Yeltsin's increasingly costly campaign promises, Russia's Central Bank imposed a series of measures today to tighten credit and keep inflation down.</p> <p>The moves came after Mr. Yeltsin instructed the Central Bank to transfer $1 billion to the federal budget so he could fulfill campaign promises to teachers, doctors and the military.</p>
['elections']	<p>The idea of owning a private farm is just a passing fancy for Anatoly F. Gorda.</p> <p>His socks are frayed. He smokes the cheapest brand of cigarettes from Rostov. And Mr. Gorda, a veterinarian who continues to work on the collective farm here  that in Soviet days was called Red Star, says he has no idea how he could afford the tractors and other equipment to till the soil.</p>
['elections']	<p>It is the season of wildflowers, cabbages and beets in Russia. Each bright, endless day is a gift bestowed on millions seeking shelter in the countryside from the drab, hopeless streets of the city.</p> <p>The short summer, cherished beyond reason in this land defined by winter, revolves completely around the summer cottage, or dacha. To the Western mind a Russian dacha may conjure images of wealth: Chekhov, grand houses with gables, rolling fields and picket fences. Dozens of dacha communities have recently emerged to serve the new Russian rich, where houses come with price tags that would make a habitue of the Hamptons blush.</p>
['elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, whose grueling pace on the campaign trail has left many Russians wondering about his often troubled health, today canceled a public meeting for the third time this week.</p> <p>His spokesman said the 65-year-old Mr. Yeltsin had lost his voice and was tired, but healthy. He added that the President did not "underestimate the excessive excitability and alarm of some mass media bodies" over his disappearance from public view. He said that Mr. Yeltsin would meet leaders in the Kremlin on Saturday and planned to attend a public event in Moscow on Sunday.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Nelson Strobridge Talbott 3d, Deputy Secretary of State, Russia expert, renowned journalist and graduate-school classmate of Bill Clinton, stopped dead  in front of a television.</p> <p>With the June 16 first round of the Russian election approaching fast, the puffy face of Boris N. Yeltsin was on the screen.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'elections']	<p>The running-mate of Moscow's popular reformist mayor in the June 16 election  was badly wounded today in a bomb blast that officials said was an attempt to sabotage the vote.</p> <p>The police said the candidate for deputy mayor, Valery Shantsev, 49, was taken to the hospital with burns and other injuries after the bomb exploded at the entrance of his apartment building here.</p>
['elections']	<p>With less than two weeks remaining before Russia's presidential election, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the once aloof and defiant Communist Party candidate, set off on his final campaign swing today, apparently ready to compromise with anyone whose name is not Yeltsin.</p> <p>As opinion polls show his popularity sinking fast, and that of President Boris N. Yeltsin continuing to rise, Mr. Zyuganov has begun reaching out to other presidential candidates with sharply differing world views -- men like the liberal economist Grigory A. Yavlinsky and the ultranationalist leader Vladimir  V. Zhirinovsky.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Ukraine officially completed its nuclear disarmament today with a scattering  of sunflower seeds by the top defense officials of the United States, Russia and Ukraine.</p> <p>The ceremony at the Pervomaisk base, where more than 80 underground silos housed SS-19 missiles aimed at the United States, marked the end of a three-year process under which Ukraine gave up the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. On Saturday the last of 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads were loaded on a train and sent to Russia for destruction.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Profoundly disenchanted by five years of faltering economic reforms but equally disturbed by the prospect of a new Communism that could drag this country back into the darkness of the Soviet era, millions of Russian voters will make the starkest political choice of their lives on Sunday.</p> <p>The differences between the main candidates seem strikingly clear: Boris N. Yeltsin, the first man elected President in Russia, promises that if he wins again his reforms will continue, openness will spread and Russia will take its place among the world's leading industrial nations.</p>
['elections']	<p>As Russians prepare for the first time in their history to choose their head  of state by popular vote, the outside world anxiously wonders if they will elect a president who will continue to reform and integrate Russia into the modern world. The answer lies in the deeper question of whether or not the Russians as a people have yet developed a sense of their national identity that will support peace abroad and accountability at home.</p> <p>In the five years since the overthrow of Communism, there have been important changes in Russia that none of the candidates would probably be able to reverse. But the most powerful ideological development has been not a growing belief in free markets and representative government, but a resurgence of Russian nationalism.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>On the day before the Russian presidential election, President Boris N. Yeltsin wrestled loose today of the rule that bans all campaigning on election eve.</p> <p>Shifting to coded messages, Mr. Yeltsin held an awards ceremony in the Kremlin that featured famous anti-Soviet artists, including the movie director Mikhail Mikhalkov, whose "Burnt by the Sun" is about Stalin's terror, and the sculptor Ernst Neizvestny, whose memorial to the millions who died in the gulag  was unveiled this week in the city of Magadan.</p>
['elections']	<p>There are 105 million Russians eligible to vote in the presidential election  on Sunday, and those who do will cast ballots at 93,000 polling places across the world's biggest country, from the Chukchi Peninsula in the Far East to the enclave of Kaliningrad on the Polish border.</p> <p>Each voter will receive a paper ballot that lists the 10 candidates in alphabetical order. As a final choice, everyone who votes has the option of marking "none of the above." If no candidate receives 50 percent of the votes, the top two finishers will square off in a second round, probably on July 7, although it could be held slightly earlier or a week later.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Penza Regional Theater of the Dramatic Arts usually sticks to the classics -- Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Chekhov. This season the company added a creaky Russian version of "All About Eve," a play based on the Bette Davis movie about an aging Broadway star. Even some of the theater directors admit that it is awful. "We searched a long time to find a play with a big part for one of our actresses who has't worked for a while," Anna B. Krasnova, 43, assistant to the artistic director, explained after a poorly attended performance on Saturday night. "Many of our actors are happy to sit home and not be disturbed as long as their paychecks come in, but this actress, well," she smiled apologetically, "she gets agitated."</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>The fragile peace in Chechnya was disrupted again today when two powerful sets of explosions rocked a convoy of Chechen rebel leaders as they returned from a negotiating session with their Russian counterparts. No one was killed in the blasts, which came came less than a day after the two sides signed a peace treaty intended to hasten the withdrawal of Russian soldiers from the secessionist southern region.</p>

['elections']	<p>When the Communist Party dominated Russian parliamentary elections last December, its leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, assumed that the vote was a down payment on future triumphs.</p> <p>"This is the core of our support," he said at the time of the 24 million votes his party and its allies received while rolling to their impressive victory at the polls. "We can only grow from here."</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Having squeezed past the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, in the first  round of Russia's presidential election, President Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday began wooing the also-rans and maneuvering for a runoff date favorable to his voters.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin took particular pains to court Aleksandr I. Lebed, the maverick general he forced into early retirement a year ago and who now, after a surprisingly strong finish in Sunday's race, could determine the president's fate. Mr. Lebed met with Mr. Yeltsin on Monday, but seemed to remain noncommittal pending a meeting with the Communists today.</p>
['currency', 'elections']	<p>The German mark rose to a one-month high against the dollar yesterday as Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, led in the first round of balloting.</p> <p>Prospects for political stability in Russia often help the mark because of the close economic ties between Russia and Germany, Russia's largest trading partner and biggest creditor.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>The retired general who came in third in Sunday's presidential race, and whose endorsement is now avidly sought by Boris N. Yeltsin, has been caricatured as a strident nationalist determined to rebuild the Russian empire on the ashes of the old Soviet Union.</p> <p>But judged by his platform and his manner, Aleksandr I. Lebed is more Colin Powell than Vladimir Zhirinovsky. An Afghan war hero whose face bears the scars  of a boxing career, Mr. Lebed is well known in the West for his impolitic prediction that the Soviet Union would be partly recreated.</p>
['elections']	<p>Heaping praise on Boris N. Yeltsin and congratulating him on a "strong showing" in the first round of Russia's presidential elections on Sunday, President Clinton today all but endorsed Mr. Yeltsin in his coming head-to-head  contest with the Communist candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov.</p> <p>The Clinton Administration has been careful not to formally anoint Mr. Yeltsin as America's choice, but officials were exultant today that the Communists had been beaten into second place, no matter how narrowly, and had been unable to expand their constituency beyond a third of the electorate.</p>
['elections']	<p>As more presidential also-rans announced their unwillingness to support his candidacy, the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov struggled today to patch together a coalition that could defeat President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>With limited resources and little time, many of Mr. Zyuganov's closest advisers are urging him to soften his image with touchy-feely television commercials, hone his issues and shed the Communist ideology that still seeps into his speeches and that voters seem to deeply mistrust.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Generation X" cannot complain that it is being ignored in the Russian presidential election. Young Russian voters are being wooed American-style -- to the sound of heavy metal.</p> <p>In a recent episode of the MTV-style get-out-the-vote show "Choose or Lose,"  Yevgeny Kemerovsky, a rock star, solemnly explained why he intends to vote for President Boris N.  Yeltsin: "I won't be able to make my music videos if the Communists come to power."</p>
['elections']	<p>With his presidency at stake in elections on Sunday, Boris N. Yeltsin took a  dramatic and unabashedly political step to insure the support of Russia's top military chiefs.</p> <p>He promoted all five of them.</p>
['television', 'elections']	<p>After a frantic flurry of last-minute political ads, the Russian presidential campaign came to an abrupt halt at midnight on Friday.</p> <p>Until the polls close on Sunday night, candidates are forbidden to make speeches or put up new posters, and all commercials on radio and television must be discontinued.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Almost every Saturday after his regular soccer match, Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov leaps into his black Volga limousine and speeds in a police convoy to construction sites across the metropolitan region to give local administrators a taste of his inimitable style of hands-on governance.</p> <p>"This is absurd!" he shouted at room filled with cringing construction engineers and administrators who explained they had budgeted $9 million to erect a telephone station in a huge, partly unfinished apartment complex in this suburb south of Moscow. "Are you people out of your minds?"</p>
['elections']	<p>Hours after he canceled yet another series of public meetings today, President Boris N. Yeltsin emerged from seclusion to deliver a stiff, brief television address urging Russians to vote for him on Wednesday.</p> <p>The wooden, tightly choreographed speech and a stream of assurances from Government officials that Mr. Yeltsin was fit and ready to win were intended to  calm an electorate made anxious by the 65-year-old President's complete absence  from public view in the past week.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops largely ignored a deadline yesterday in the peace agreement with separatists in Chechnya, failing to dismantle all Russian checkpoints as promised.</p> <p>Only 4 of 32 Russian checkpoints were being taken down, said Roman Sokolovsky, a Russian military spokesman. Under last month's agreement, all were to have been removed by the end of the day today.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'credit', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>Citing the Yeltsin Government's problems with tax collection, the International Monetary Fund said today that it would delay its $330 million payment to Russia this month for the first time.</p> <p>When Russia was granted a $10.2 billion three-year loan in February, the Fund set particularly stringent conditions, including monthly reviews of Russia's economic status.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin today heightened alarm about his health and gave new impetus to a power struggle in the Kremlin when he abruptly left Moscow for  a sanitarium.</p> <p>His sudden departure for what an aide described as a two-week vacation stunned an American delegation headed by Vice President Al Gore, whose meeting with Mr. Yeltsin was canceled at the last minute. The Americans had hoped to use the meeting to underscore support for the Russian President and assess his physical stamina following a grueling re-election campaign.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops blockaded villages in southeastern Chechnya today, and Chechen rebels attacked a Russian armored vehicle in Grozny, the capital.</p> <p>The Russian blockade in southern Chechnya began with last week's offensive against two villages, including one where military commanders say the rebel leader has his headquarters. At least 39 civilians were killed in Russian air and artillery attacks, said the pro-Moscow Chechen Prime Minister, Nikolai Koshman. On Sunday, soldiers sealed off three other villages, said Sanaki Arbiyev, Deputy Prime Minister of the pro-Moscow government.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States and Russia agreed today to press for international ratification of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty though they said it does not fully satisfy either of them.</p> <p>The agreement, announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, was an effort to break a negotiating stalemate as a deadline approaches for completion of the long-sought treaty.</p>
['elections']	<p>For the last six months Russia has been a country seemingly at war with itself. There has been no fighting in the streets, but not one of the many candidates for the presidency could avoid mentioning the ominous possibility that the new Russia's first presidential election might end in civil war.</p> <p>And yet today this half-year-long epic of political tension and Kremlin intrigue suddenly gave way to what is known in Russian history as a peredishka,  a time-out.</p>
['elections']	<p>Pledging to "resurrect Russia" after his decisive victory over a Communist opponent, a visibly pleased Boris N. Yeltsin reappointed Viktor S. Chernomyrdin  as Prime Minister today and appealed to the nation to overcome its political discord.</p> <p>"The election was a very tense one," the President said. "You have resolved this debate. Let us not divide the country into the victorious and the vanquished. Let us work."</p>
['elections']	<p>President Clinton today praised President Boris N. Yeltsin's election victory as a milestone in Russia's democratic progress, saying that Russian voters had "turned their backs on tyranny."</p> <p>"They are turning the corner towards freedom," Mr. Clinton said at an Independence Day event in Maryland. "They and their leaders have cleared another important hurdle in building a new and enduring democracy."</p>
['finances', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>Managers of mutual funds that invest in Russian stocks expect an increase in  money flowing into the country with President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election.</p> <p>"It is fair to say that Russia has passed a major milestone," said Richard Sobel, manager of the $194 million First NIS Regional Fund of Baring Asset Management, which invests mainly in Russia. "It will make it possible to unlock  a major pool of capital."</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin failed again today to make any public appearances, fueling deepening concern over his health just three days before the presidential runoff election.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, who is 65 and has a long history of health problems, has not been seen in public since Wednesday. He missed his last major chance to campaign today, when he did not appear at a large party sponsored by a Moscow newspaper to which he had been invited. By law, campaigning must stop on Monday.</p>
['elections']	<p>At its lavish headquarters, Russia's most powerful company makes no bones about which candidate it is supporting in the presidential election.</p> <p>Surrounded by manicured gardens and tennis courts, a 34-story skyscraper radiates the wealth and power of the company, Gazprom. And these days, President Boris N. Yeltsin looks down approvingly from a campaign poster behind  the marble fountain in the entranceway.</p>
['bombs and explosives']	<p>For the second day in a row, a bomb ripped through a trolley bus in central Moscow this morning, wounding at least six people.</p> <p>Today's bomb, at the Prospect Mira in northeast Moscow, mimicked the Thursday explosion in Pushkin Square, which wounded five.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>The Russian Army general chosen today by President Boris N. Yeltsin to head the Defense Ministry represents a bureaucratic victory for the administration's  new security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed.</p> <p>The new Defense Minister, Col. Gen. Igor N. Rodionov, is a contentious figure among reformers because of his role in a brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations in Georgia during the waning years of the Soviet Union.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>With a zeal that belies his obvious illness, Boris N. Yeltsin has over the past month turned the Kremlin into a hive of intrigue and caprice so dense and imponderable, so filled with lieutenants famously at odds with one another, that even one of the world's greatest chess masters cannot seem to draw meaning from  it all.</p> <p>"I play a game where there are rules," said Garry Kasparov, a world chess champion and reform-minded Russian politician. "I see the movement of each piece on the board. But this is something entirely different. If there are rules to this game, then they are rules made and understood by one man only."</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops blockaded several villages in southeastern Chechnya today, contending that rebel fighters are hiding in them.</p> <p>A new Russian offensive begun last week against separatists in Chechnya focused on two southern villages, including the village of Makhkety, where military commanders say the rebel leader, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, has his headquarters.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Vice President Al Gore, opening a three-day visit to Russia, met here today with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to discuss economic reforms and the expansion of NATO.</p> <p>Mr. Gore will meet on Monday with Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President's first meeting with a foreign leader since his victory in the runoff election on  July 3.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Clinton Administration, and its allies in Bosnia, have concluded that the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, will not deliver on his earlier promises  to remove two Bosnian Serb leaders indicted on war crimes charges from their positions of power, American and European diplomats say.</p> <p>That leaves the allies facing limited and unappetizing options, which include reimposing sanctions on Yugoslavia or taking military action to seize Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, and possibly the Bosnian Serb military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton told reporters today that he had telephoned the freshly re-elected Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and had congratulated him for taking "the 'Comeback Kid' label away from me."</p> <p>Mr. Clinton said the two men spoke for about 25 minutes. Mr. Yeltsin "sounded so good" that "I didn't have to ask him about his health," he said, an assertion supported by other officials here.</p>
['elections']	<p>In this Communist stronghold, Gennadi A. Zyuganov's supporters do not intend  to gently fade away.</p> <p>"We will stay in the opposition," vowed Mikhail F. Kosykh, the First Secretary of the Communist Party here and a member of the Russian Parliament, contemplating his candidate's defeat by President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['elections']	<p>Rejecting a return to the Communist past that has defined 20th-century Russia, voters re-elected the country's first President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on Wednesday by an unexpectedly wide margin.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, who played a crucial role in the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the creation of the new Russian state, arose from what seemed like political oblivion to defeat his challenger, the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Amid the palpable relief in the Clinton Administration over Boris N. Yeltsin's victory in today's Russian election is some quiet wagering, officials  say, over how quickly Mr. Yeltsin will have the bypass operation on his heart he so clearly seems to need.</p> <p>The last few days of tension over Mr. Yeltsin's health were exacerbated by the Americans' lack of access to the Russian President, though the Russians insisted that Mr. Yeltsin's condition was not life-threatening. There is a similar concern, the officials say, over Mr. Yeltsin's plans for a second term,  though "we look to quickly engage with Yeltsin and his team over economic and security issues," a senior Administration official said today.</p>
['elections']	<p>Round midnight, while top Yeltsin campaign aides remained huddled behind closed office doors in the heavily guarded Presidential Hotel, champagne and cognac bottles were already uncorked across the hall, where young campaign aides gathered to celebrate the early, promising returns.</p> <p>As television sets blared out reports of President Boris N. Yeltsin's early lead, the young ones laughed giddily and traded jokes built on oft-repeated campaign slogans. In the hall, an older campaign worker drew heavily on a cigarette and searched for historical closure. "This was the Communists' last chance," Maksharip M. Yandeyev, a campaign adviser, said soberly. "Ttey will never rise up again. This is their final death throe."</p>
['elections']	<p>Nine months ago, Boris N. Yeltsin was hidden away in an elite Moscow hospital with severe heart problems. His popularity had sunk even lower than his health.  It seemed improbable then that the ailing and discredited 65-year-old Russian President could run for re-election, let alone win.</p> <p>His victory today is testimony to his extraordinary personal resilience -- his lifelong procrastinator's gift for rousing himself from deep slumps to ride  out a crisis on a sudden gust of energy and willpower.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>Appearing wan and stiff, President Boris N. Yeltsin met with Vice President Al Gore today in a session that failed to dispel nagging questions about the Russian leader's health.</p> <p>The 45-minute meeting, at the Barvikha sanitarium outside Moscow, followed the abrupt cancellation of a meeting between the two men that had been scheduled for Monday. The cancellation prompted new worries about Mr. Yeltsin, who has a history of heart disease and had been out of public view for nearly three weeks, cutting short a grueling re-election campaign.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>While traveling, you are often asked what you do for a living. Lately I answer that I'm a foreign affairs columnist and that means I cover wars -- occasionally wars between countries but more often the wars between economic winners and losers within countries. Because it is these domestic wars that increasingly shape international affairs, from Russia to Mexico to Turkey.</p> <p>Why have such internal wars become so sharp? The short answer is "globalization" -- the integration of free markets, financial flows, trade and information -- which has established a very powerful set of rules and standards  for how countries have to behave if they are going to attract investment capital to grow. You can call those rules "The Paradigm." Once a country opens itself up to the global market and accepts The Paradigm, those of its citizens with the skills to take advantage of it become the winners and those without become losers or left-behinds.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances']	<p>In a stinging rebuff to President Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist-dominated Parliament has rejected legislation intended to encourage billions of dollars of foreign investment in the oil and gas industry.</p>
['ethics']	<p>In an early test of President Boris N. Yeltsin's promise to root out corruption if re-elected, the retired general who heads Parliament's defense committee has accused some of Russia's highest-ranking generals of enriching themselves from the military budget.</p> <p>The charges, which have become the talk of Moscow, have rocked the military establishment.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>Ever since Russia and China embarked on their separate paths of reform there's been a competition between the two over who got it right. In this race,  China was always viewed as the hare, which rushed ahead with economic reform, leaving political reform for later. Russia was always viewed as the tortoise, which, stupidly in the minds of the Chinese, tried to do political and economic  reform at once. Well, don't count the tortoise out yet.</p> <p>Yes, China has a huge economic lead on Russia, but keep this in mind: With the democratic election of Boris Yeltsin as President last week, Russia has basically passed over a huge speed bump on the road to its development; it has made the political transition to a rudimentary form of democracy, and has done so rather smoothly. China, while it is growing rapidly, still has this huge speed bump waiting for it down the road: How will it make the transition from Communist dictatorship to a more democratic system? Because as China grows more  prosperous, its people will inevitably demand a more participatory government, and to reach the next stage of economic development Chinese businesses will require a less arbitrary system, with real rule of law. No one, least of all investors in China, knows what will happen to China when it hits that speed bump. So in the race between the tortoise and the hare, score last week a Great  Leap Forward for the tortoise.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Victory finds a hundred fathers, it is said, while defeat is an orphan. But three American political consultants to President Boris N. Yeltsin's campaign say the victory was theirs alone.</p> <p>Russian campaign aides insist that the team of West Coast consultants who worked behind the scenes on the campaign with Tatyana Dyachenko, Mr. Yeltsin's daughter, made only a marginal contribution, but there is no doubt that the Americans pulled off a masterly public relations coup back home. Their story is  not quite "The Making of the Russian President," but it is an example of yet another modern American campaign technique -- The Selling of the Consultants.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>With breathtaking speed, Russia's Far East has switched in five years from propping up North Korea's Communist Government to welcoming South Korean investment and trade.</p> <p>In the wake of diplomatic ties between Russia and South Korea being established in 1991, trade between the two countries has tripled, reaching about $3 billion last year. In contrast, trade between Russia and North Korea has collapsed, falling to $140 million last year, from $2.6 billion in 1990.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Russian voters will make a distinct and fateful choice in Wednesday's presidential election, but the economic and social problems that will surface after they cast their ballots will bedevil the Government no matter who wins.</p> <p>Even if President Boris N. Yeltsin wins re-election, his Government will have little time for rejoicing. Tax revenues are dangerously low, while Government spending throughout the campaign was feverish and unaccounted for.</p>
['elections']	<p>Before all the Sovietologists who argued that Russia was congenitally incapable of democracy explain to you why the Russian elections don't really matter, before they warn you about the looming fiscal crisis in Russia, the shrinking arteries of Boris Yeltsin or the authoritarian twitches of Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, take just one moment to savor this moment. For the first time in history an independent Russian people -- not the oligarchs, not the bankers,  not the mafia -- has chosen a president in a free and fair election. Despite all the hardships and uncertainties that have characterized life here since the collapse of the Soviet Union, an overwhelming majority of Russians actually voted for the candidate who promised to continue the wrenching transition to an  open society with a free market. That is a big deal. It is a remarkable triumph  of hope over hardship. While this single election doesn't guarantee that Russia  will make it all the way to American-style free-market democracy, it does guarantee that the effort will move forward now with a solid popular mandate. The debate about where Russia is heading is over.</p> <p>But whether it will arrive anytime soon is another question. And here one is  entitled to some pessimism. Americans who came of age during the cold war grew up with a Russia that was a very fixed, frozen entity. We knew exactly what it was and, more or less, what could be expected from it. Our children's generation, I suspect, is going to grow up dealing with a Russia that is in a long, long transition, lurching forward in the direction of free markets and democracy, but with much uncertainty over how long it will take. Because while a majority of Russians have now rejected the past, they still have not freed themselves from its lingering grasp in many areas.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Vice President Al Gore will urge President Boris N. Yeltsin to capitalize on  the mandate for reform that he won with his re-election when the two men meet in Moscow, probably on Monday, American officials said this week. Mr. Gore is to arrive in Moscow tonight.</p> <p>He and about half the United States Cabinet will be in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday for the seventh in a series of semi-annual meetings with their Russian counterparts, led by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has been renominated to his post by Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Sounding more like a hawkish military commander than the man most Russians thought would finally bring an end to the war in Chechnya, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the new national security adviser to President Boris N. Yeltsin, today took a far more bellicose stance on the war there than he ever has before.</p> <p>Although he said he soon plans to visit the secessionist southern republic to try to negotiate a new peace accord, Mr. Lebed's remarks today indicate that the deeply unpopular war, which has killed at least 30,000 people in the last 18 months, may still be far from over.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops ended their fierce assault on one Chechen village today but kept up a siege against another, which they contend is the headquarters of the top rebel leader.</p> <p>The military's attack began about two weeks after the re-election of President Boris N. Yeltsin, who had promised during the election campaign to end the unpopular war in Chechnya.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>It may be time to revive the hot line between the U.S. and Russia. Seriously.</p> <p>During the cold war Americans always knew what Russia's basic intentions were and how to deal with them. But, paradoxically, as Russia becomes more like America -- that is, democratic and inward-looking, with real political parties,  interest groups, lobbies and a free press all tugging at decision makers -- it becomes harder for Washington to predict or control Russian behavior. Alexei Arbatov, deputy head of the Defense Committee in the Russian parliament, quipped to me that if Nikita Khrush-chev were alive today and deployed nuclear missiles  to Cuba, as he did in 1962, he would have to fire them at the U.S. rather than withdraw them, "because Russian public opinion, the parliament and the free press today would never have allowed him to back down, declare the whole thing a victory and then just walk away without anyone saying a word of criticism."</p>
['crime and criminals', 'war and revolution']	<p>More than half a century has passed since the Soviet occupiers of a defeated  Germany perpetrated what Germans regard as the art theft of all time: By German  accounts, more than 200,000 works of art and countless books and documents were  carried off to the Soviet Union at the end of World War II.</p> <p>And today, with Germany reunified and the cold war behind them, Russia and Germany remain in history's grasp over one last campaign from that era, the fight for control of Renoirs and Rembrandts.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'elections']	<p>Glancing through a sheaf of papers while rattling off the fine points of a debate he had just attended in Parliament, Yuri Shtern talked to visitors in his spartan office with the air of a practiced legislator.</p>
['war and revolution', 'law and legislation']	<p>Time has stooped Vladimir Trotsenko's shoulders, but his memories are as clear as his cobalt blue eyes: the American flyer, his right arm in a new cast,  in a Soviet military hospital ward. The American, he recalled, would slowly repeat, "America -- San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Chicago."</p> <p>Curious, Mr. Trotsenko, a paratrooper recovering from a knee injury, would hobble down the third-floor hospital corridor to gaze at the four imprisoned Americans. The airman with the broken arm would point to a crewman in a body cast and would make cradling motions with his arms, indicating that the man had  left two small children back home.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'war and revolution']	<p>Authorities found the bodies of 10 Russian prisoners of war today who military officials say were used as slave laborers, then tortured and executed by Chechen rebels.</p> <p>The bodies of four officers and six soldiers were found near Khatuni, in southeastern Chechnya, where Russian forces are attacking separatists seeking independence for Chechnya, Russian officials said.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Fear and anger swept across the Russian capital today after a second bomb in  less than 24 hours tore through a trolley bus in Moscow at the height of the morning rush hour.</p> <p>The blast, which sent 30 passengers to the hospital, blew a hole in the top of the bus and sent glass shards and twisted metal flying across the crowded roadway. Somehow, no one was killed.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Ever since the war in Chechnya began nearly two years ago, Aleksandr I. Lebed  always insisted that it would end in disaster for Russia. He often told President Boris N. Yeltsin that the people running the war were fools and that it would take someone special, someone like himself, to end it.</p> <p>So Mr. Yeltsin, realizing he had nothing much more to lose from a war that has brought little but shame and death for Russia, decided to grant his blunt new security chief his wish. At least on paper.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Russia, eager to bolster its economy with the hard currency it earns from the sale of everything from bullets to jet fighters, surpassed the United States and France last year as the largest arms seller to the developing world, according to a new Congressional report.</p> <p>The report by the Congressional Research Service calculated that Russian arms sales to developing nations rebounded from a slump that set in after the breakup of the Soviet Union, growing by 62 percent last year -- to $6 billion in 1995 from $3.7 billion in 1994 -- and that its most important buyer was China.</p>
['ethics']	<p>The word was on the streets by the beginning of the month. The market in the center of this Russian-occupied and nearly razed city had never been busier. Truckloads of bread sold out every hour. Cucumbers, garlic and tomatoes, the staples of summer life here, were moving by the crate.</p> <p>''They told us,'' said Tamara Pipkin, 42, who somehow survived under the nearly endless siege conditions in Grozny in the last two years. ''The fighters said they were coming in on the 6th. They told us to get food and water and go into the basements. They said they were taking the city back.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The latest truce in the war for Chechnya began today at noon.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, two Russian SU-25 attack planes swooped across the azure skies, firing rockets at a caravan of refugees who were trying to take advantage of the announced truce to flee Grozny, the besieged Chechen capital.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's national security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, who recently expressed scathing contempt for the Kremlin's handling of the Chechen war, was given broad powers today to take over the efforts to end the fighting.</p> <p>The Kremlin press service released a statement tonight confirming that Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree giving Mr. Lebed full responsibility for overseeing the Chechen crisis.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>As plans for a Russian troop withdrawal from the Chechen capital of Grozny ground to a halt today, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the  Russian national security adviser,  met with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to try to rally top-level support for his plan to end the war in Chechnya.</p> <p>Neither man revealed the contents of their discussion. Mr. Lebed, who cut short talks with rebel leaders on Sunday saying he had to deal with those in Moscow who ''want to torpedo the process,'' had hoped to meet with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin today and press his case. That meeting did not take place.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>A country that has wondered whether its president would play a visible role in ending the war in Chechnya got an answer of sorts today.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin is on vacation. He has appeared in public once in the last two months, on Aug. 9, which was the day he was inaugurated and the day Russian troops were crushed in a renewed Chechen offensive in Grozny. His wishes are passed to the Russian people through press spokesmen who rarely see him. And today, responding to a wave of rumors and speculation about why the President has refused to meet his national security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, even once since Mr. Lebed was given the authority to end the war in Chechnya, Mr. Yeltsin's press office gave a briefing.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Despite reports that Chechen rebels have begun withdrawing from the region's capital, fighting raged again today as Russian troops, backed by airstrikes and helicopter fire, fought to recapture positions where soldiers and civilians have been trapped for days.</p> <p>As the battle in southern Russia continued, the Communist-dominated Russian Parliament voted today to approve the reappointment of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin by President Boris N. Yeltsin. And Mr. Chernomyrdin quickly took the political offensive in the deeply unpopular conflict, demanding that the top Russian prosecutor investigate why Russian troops were unable to avert a rebel incursion into a city they have controlled for more than a year.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Chechen rebels dedicated to humiliating President Boris N. Yeltsin on the eve of his inaugural took virtual control of their republic's ruined capital today, killing scores of Russian soldiers, wounding hundreds more and sending rings of fire spreading across the city.</p> <p>The audacious assault on Grozny, which the Russian Air Force practically leveled in 1995, began on Tuesday and raged throughout the day as Russian helicopter gunships tried desperately to pick off the rebels with rockets. According to reports from the scene, the rockets killed mostly civilians, whose corpses were strewn on the bomb-scarred roadways.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>It takes less than two hours to find the most wanted man in Russia. Shamil Basayev spends most of his time these days in a bunker the size of a jail cell, but more heavily guarded, only a few hundred yards from the center of the nearly demolished city he has just seized from the Russian Army.</p> <p>''I am back for good now,'' Mr. Basayev said today in a lengthy interview punctuated frequently by the dull thud of mortar rounds. ''I left once before. I won't be going again.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced a new Cabinet today that looked remarkably like the old one -- with one striking exception.</p> <p>Vladimir O. Potanin, 35, president of Oneximbank, one of Russia's richest and most powerful private banks, was put in charge of coordinating economic policy, including the sensitive issue of privatization.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>There is only one open road left into this city. It is a long series of bomb craters, really, mixed with dirt, mud and occasionally some asphalt. The road starts in the deep woods just southwest of town and runs straight toward the ravaged center.</p> <p>The road has no name, but it does not need one, because everybody knows what it is there for. It is the last, harrowing route to safety each day for thousands of anguished refugees who have been driven from their homes here in the capital of Chechnya by war and death, and it is the best entry route for the secessionist rebels who now reign over most of the city.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Col. Pyotr Litovsky's eyes were red and grim from too much dust, too much vodka and too much death.</p> <p>''I propose a toast,'' he said wearily, pointing to a group of soldiers who accompanied Aleksandr I. Lebed, the Russian national security adviser, this weekend on his latest attempt to stop the war here. ''I toast the memory of the great Russian Army. Let us not forget what happened in Chechnya, so that we will never be humiliated again.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Saying he could not possibly bring peace to Chechnya when so many people in Moscow ''want to torpedo the process,'' Aleksandr I. Lebed, the Russian national security adviser, today abruptly canceled his most important negotiating session yet and returned home to fight new battles in the Kremlin.</p> <p>Mr. Lebed had fully expected to reach a final agreement this afternoon on Chechnya's relationship with Russia -- the crux of the 20-month war here. But as his helicopter was preparing to leave for Novye Atagi, the site of the meetings, he announced he would not attend them.</p>
['elections']	<p>Wasn't it supposed to be capitalism that died of internal contradictions?</p> <p>Today, in Moscow, there were plenty of contradictions on show, not to mention animosities, rivalries, anxieties and denial. But not among capitalists. This display, on the outskirts of Moscow, was the first meeting of the Russian Communist Party  since Boris N. Yeltsin defeated the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, for the presidency.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's new national security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, returned appalled and angry today from secret talks with rebel commanders in Chechnya, but his rage was not directed at the enemy. At a news conference, Mr. Lebed, a former general and Afghan war hero, expressed horror at the condition of Russian troops and disgust over the conduct of bureaucrats leading the war effort.</p> <p>''I suspect partisans in World War II were better clothed,'' he said of the Russian servicemen he saw at checkpoints and whom he described as ''hungry, lice-infested and underclothed.'' He said the soldiers stationed in Chechnya were kept there as ''cannon fodder'' and should be removed from combat ''for purely humanitarian considerations.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>This desperate city continued to shake under the relentless aerial assault of Russian forces today, despite an urgent overnight visit to the region by the Kremlin's chief security official, Aleksandr I. Lebed.</p> <p>Mr. Lebed, until recently Russia's most powerful and vocal critic of the grueling 20-month war in Chechnya, appeared in the battle area for the first time and met with the separatist military leader, Aslan Maskhadov, just 12 miles south of here. Mr. Lebed and others who attended the meeting in the rebel-held town of Starye Atagi said the commanders agreed that the killing must stop.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Peace between Russia and its mutinous republic of Chechnya seemed closer than ever today. But peace between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his chief security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, did not.</p> <p>Late on Friday, Mr. Yeltsin halfheartedly endorsed Mr. Lebed's plan for ending the war in Chechnya and congratulated him on the ''first steps'' he had made. Flying here from Moscow today for more talks with the rebel leaders, Mr. Lebed angrily produced a decree signed by Mr. Yeltsin on Aug. 18 but made public just today. He said it would be ''almost impossible'' to stop the war if the decree was enforced.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>At the sprawling military hospital here, fruits and vegetables are tenderly stored in a vast, cool cellar for the winter.</p> <p>The bodies of Russian soldiers killed in Chechnya lie 100 yards away, tossed in a dusty open field where dogs are free to prowl. A few bodies are covered with sheets, but most are naked, even those burned to the bone. All are bloated, blackened and covered with flies. A stench fills the air.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>As Russian troops continued a bitter three-day battle to regain control of Grozny today, a rebel leader in Chechnya stated in an article to be published in Izvestia on Friday that the rebel forces had accomplished their mission and would soon withdraw.</p> <p>The ferocious assault, which left several hundred dead, was a brazen show of force intended to cast a pall over Moscow on the eve of President Boris N. Yeltsin's inauguration on Friday. Rebels who invaded the capital of the breakaway republic of Chechnya on Tuesday said they did so to underscore the collapse of peace proposals by Mr. Yeltsin during his re-election campaign.</p>
['elections']	<p>In Soviet times, the closest thing to a festive inauguration ceremony for a new leader was the funeral of his predecessor.</p> <p>As President Boris N. Yeltsin prepares to take the oath of office on Aug. 9 as the first democratically elected President of an independent Russia, his staff is struggling to concoct a ceremony that is without precedent or etiquette rules in this country's 1,000 years of authoritarian rule.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a letter that arrived in Moscow this morning, President Clinton appealed to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia not to allow a major military attack on the Chechen capital and to pursue a negotiated settlement, senior White House officials said today.</p> <p>Michael McCurry, the White House spokesman, said that the letter reflected an American concern for the loss of civilian life in Chechnya. Other officials said its urgency was sparked by reports that a Russian offensive on Grozny, the Chechen capital, could start Thursday.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The dangerous chasm between Russia's civilian and military leaders persisted today as President Boris N. Yeltsin's national security adviser and his Defense Minister rebuked their commanders in Chechnya for issuing ultimatums to the rebels in Chechnya that, as the Defense Minister put it, ''they had absolutely no right to give.''</p> <p>But appearing to pay no attention,  military leaders unleashed a brief but powerful assault on the Chechen capital, Grozny, this afternoon with planes and heavy artillery.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>The American Government-owned corporation that is charged with acquiring much of Russia's military stockpile of uranium for resale as civilian nuclear reactor fuel turned down repeated Russian offers this year to sell material sufficient to build 400 bombs comparable to the one that destroyed Hiroshima.</p> <p>The incident raises the question of whether the corporation, the United States Enrichment Corporation, put its own profits ahead of national security.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian and Chechen military commanders signed an agreement today committing them to a military disengagement in the ravaged capital of rebellious Chechnya. But the Russian official who brokered the truce, Aleksandr I. Lebed, remained pinned down in Moscow, unable to secure President Boris N. Yeltsin's blessing for a broader peace accord that is being denounced by Russian nationalists as a sell-out.</p> <p>The document signed in Chechnya today was an accord to withdraw Russian and rebel troops from the Chechen capital, Grozny, by Sept. 1. The pullbacks are to begin on Wednesday, despite recent violations of a cease-fire reached last week. Today's agreement also calls for joint units to patrol the city after the fighting forces leave.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Calming days of mounting concern that President Boris N. Yeltsin may be too sick to rule Russia, his doctors said today that the Russian leader would go ahead with a bypass operation and was expected to make a full recovery.</p> <p>The surprisingly optimistic prognosis, endorsed by the renowned American specialist Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, gave a badly needed lift to the Yeltsin Government, which had been shaken by assertions that he might be too sick to risk surgery.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>After months of speculation and rumors about the health of Boris N. Yeltsin, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, the American pioneering heart surgeon, and Russian doctors gave the first detailed account of his medical condition and prospects for heart surgery.</p> <p>Dr. DeBakey, who was asked to consult on Mr. Yeltsin's case while attending a scientific meeting that ended here today, said, ''Contrary to what has been reported, he looked a lot better than the pictures suggested, and in fact his general condition is not bad at all.'' After studying Mr. Yeltsin's charts and examining the patient, Dr. DeBakey said that despite speculation, Mr. Yeltsin's liver, kidneys and lungs were normal.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>It was over the summer vacation that Emlyn Evans, a 17-year-old in his final year at the Millfield School here, heard about the new student preparing to enroll this fall.</p> <p>First he read about it in The Times of London. Then friends started telephoning -- they had seen a report on the 10 o'clock news. But Emlyn was unfazed, responding with typical teen-age insouciance.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States launched a second missile strike against Iraq's southern air defenses tonight, just hours after President Clinton vowed that he would make President Saddam Hussein ''pay a price'' for sending his troops into the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq.</p> <p>Three Navy ships and a submarine in the Persian Gulf launched 17 cruise missiles less than a day after the first American attack, in which  27 cruise missiles were fired against Iraqi military targets.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The rest of the world, including most of America's NATO allies in Europe, made it clear today that the United States was on its own in taking military action against Iraq.</p> <p>Britain expressed strong support in words but kept the planes it has in the region out of the operation. Prime Minister John Major said the attack this morning was justified.  France did not take part either, and did not endorse the American decision to take military action, even after President Clinton called President Jacques Chirac before the missile attack in an appeal for support.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In the grimmest assessment to date of the toll in Chechnya, Aleksandr I. Lebed said today that about 80,000 people had been killed in the fighting and that some 240,000 had been wounded.</p> <p>The estimates by President Boris N. Yeltsin's security adviser far exceed many casualty projections, which hold that 30,000 to 40,000 people have been killed in 21 months of war. But some human rights organizations said Mr. Lebed's figures are more up to date.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Just two days  after Russian and Chechen officials signed an agreement to end the Chechen war, top Kremlin officials bluntly expressed misgivings today about the accord.</p> <p>The cool Kremlin response has cast a cloud over the accord, reflecting the power struggle between Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the stolid Prime Minister, and his new rival, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the security adviser who led the negotiations for the Russian side.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Ending months of silence about his health and shattering a Kremlin taboo, President Boris N. Yeltsin acknowledged today that he needed heart surgery and said he would have an operation later this month in Moscow.</p> <p>''I want to have a society based on truth,'' said Mr. Yeltsin, who is 65. ''That means no longer hiding what we used to hide.''</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, on vacation and resting up for heart surgery, formally handed over authority today for national security and law enforcement to his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin will still hold onto the nuclear button, the President's spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said. But in a move that seemed partly aimed at curbing the ambitions of the national security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, intelligence and the interior, who normally report to the President, will now report to Mr. Chernomyrdin.</p>
['medicine and health', 'biographical information']	<p>When Boris N. Yeltsin's doctors meet on Wednesday to decide if and when the President should have a heart bypass operation, one of Russia's most renowned heart surgeons will not be there.</p> <p>The surgeon, Dr. Leo Bokeria, the head of Bakulev Institute, said that neither he nor any of his aides had been invited to take part in the consultations even though his center does more bypass operations than any other in Russia.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States and Russia have reached agreement on the first part of an understanding that would allow the United States to proceed with efforts to build defenses against shorter-range missiles, while preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.</p> <p>The announcement was made yesterday by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia. It was a confirmation of a tentative agreement reached in June, at the end of a meeting that covered contentious topics like Russian opposition to the expansion of NATO, Russian opposition to missile strikes on Iraq and Russian support for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom Washington wants to replace.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Six years ago this fall, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a powerful coalition was painstakingly assembled here that ultimately gave the Bush Administration's war against Saddam Hussein not only the cover of the United Nations but also the backing of many of the world's major countries.</p> <p>This week, the United States has been almost isolated diplomatically as the Clinton Administration and a few friendly countries have tried to win support for even a condemnation of Iraq for its incursion into Kurdish territory. Washington's strikes on Iraq have been met with unease and even sharp criticism.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Asked about the health of President Boris N. Yeltsin, his chief of staff, Anatoly B. Chubais, admitted today that there was a problem.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, he said, was fine. But Mr. Chubais conceded that the Kremlin had mishandled growing skepticism about the 65-year-old Russian President's condition. He refused to describe Mr. Yeltsin's symptoms, but promised that a ''new information policy'' would be unveiled within the next few days. ''The less official information there is,'' he said, ''the more rumors, conjectures and speculations there are.''</p>
['elections']	<p>Cocky and unbowed, Aleksandr I. Lebed announced his presidential ambitions only three hours after President Boris N. Yeltsin angrily dismissed him as national security adviser.</p> <p>''I will begin streamlining a political structure and begin preparing for possible elections,'' he said serenely at a news conference today.</p>
['public opinion']	<p>There was winter in the air in Red Square tonight, but no fear. Police officers, under orders from Russia's Interior Ministry to increase patrols in Moscow and tighten security at major buildings, shooed reporters away from Lenin's Tomb. But they weren't very vigorous about it.</p> <p>Perhaps the most astounding effect of the dismissal of Aleksandr I. Lebed was how uneventful -- or at least expected -- it seemed to an electorate that this year has chosen between Communism and capitalism, has watched President Boris N. Yeltsin essentially disappear from public life and into hospitals, and has endured the ravages of war in Chechnya and poverty at home.</p>
['elections']	<p>Four months after publicly embracing him as a political heir, President Boris N. Yeltsin angrily appeared on national television tonight and dismissed Aleksandr I. Lebed, his frank and aggressive national security chief.</p> <p>Looking frail but determined in his first prolonged television appearance in weeks, Mr. Yeltsin said he could no longer tolerate the brazen and insubordinate behavior of the 46-year-old former army general.</p>
['elections']	<p>No matter the outcome of Boris Yeltsin's coming heart surgery, uncertainty about his ability to serve out his second term has jump-started planning and plotting to succeed him. On Saturday, his security adviser, Aleksandr Lebed, called for the President to step down until he has recovered.</p> <p>While the list of candidates poised to compete is rather obvious, the context that will shape future power struggles is less well understood. Russia's political landscape has changed substantially since the July presidential election.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>In a rare turn to foreign policy on the campaign trail, President Clinton today called for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to extend full membership to a first group of former Soviet bloc nations by the spring of 1999, the 50th anniversary of the Western military alliance.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton, saying that a ''gray zone of insecurity must not reemerge in Europe,'' urged Russia to view NATO's enlargement to former Warsaw Pact countries as an arrangement that will ''advance the security of everyone.'' And he told the American public that the expansion cannot be made ''on the cheap.''</p>
['elections']	<p>BILL CLINTON</p> <p>Speaking yesterday in Detroit:</p> <p>''The bedrock of our common security remains NATO. When President Truman signed the North Atlantic Treaty 47 years ago, he expressed the goal of its founders plainly, but powerfully: to preserve their present peaceful situation and to protect it in the future. All of us here today, every single one of us, are the beneficiaries of NATO's extraordinary success in doing just that.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power']	<p>Few Russian companies are able to entice Westerners to line up to buy their shares, given the unstable political and economic situation in the country. But investors raced to buy the initial public offering of Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas company, today and paid a premium for the shares when trading opened in London.</p> <p>Their eagerness illustrated a contemporary Russian political reality: When Gazprom talks, officials listen. Indeed, the company's chairman, responding to a planned Government crackdown on tax delinquents, put it bluntly -- what is good for Gazprom is good for Russia.</p>
['atomic energy']	<p>The United States and Norway have agreed to provide technical aid and financing to help Russia dispose of nuclear submarine reactors and other radioactive waste that was dumped in the Barents and Kara Seas by the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The Norwegian initiative stems from fear of a nuclear accident or the slow poisoning of one of the world's richest fishing zones, which is also home to Russia's Northern Fleet.</p>
['elections']	<p>President Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Aleksandr I. Lebed from his post as chief of Russia's Security Council was more or less preordained and made clear what everyone knew all along: Mr. Lebed wants to be president. But the ousted general, who immediately announced his candidacy for the post, faces a daunting battle.</p> <p>The stony-faced Mr. Lebed was invited into the Government only because he won enough votes in the first round of the presidential elections to help elect Mr. Yeltsin in the second and decisive round. His official functions were so vaguely defined that he was certain to encroach on other Cabinet officers, especially his archenemy, Anatoly Kulikov, Russia's Interior Minister.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Bosnian Serbs have far more heavy weapons than they formally declared and have resorted to subterfuge to avoid destroying their excessive stock, said Western officials who have been meeting here for the last two days.</p> <p>The violations of the Balkans arms reduction agreement were determined by the officials who have been exchanging intelligence information in closed meetings here.</p>
['finances']	<p>Mikhail B. Piotrovsky is not daunted by the fact that every major New York museum is in the middle of an ambitious fund-raising drive. In fact, Dr. Piotrovsky, the director of the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, wishes them well.</p> <p>''New York is my favorite city, after St. Petersburg and Rome,'' Dr. Piotrovsky said, surveying the foggy Manhattan skyline from a conference room adjacent to the offices of the American Friends of the Hermitage Museum.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>If proof were needed that history takes curious turns, there is evidence in the heavy-set warlord with the shoe-brush mustache whose portraits loom over this old Central Asian city. Once a Communist general, he is now spoken of by people in northern Afghanistan as Pasha, a title used by some of the region's ancient kings.</p> <p>Early in his career, Abdul Rashid Dostum had been by turns a Communist union boss on an Afghan gas field built by Soviet engineers and  leader of an ethnic Uzbek militia that sided with the Soviet occupiers in their war with Muslim guerrillas. When the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan in 1989, he seemed washed up. But he later became a major battlefield commander for Afghanistan's Communist dictatorship who won honors for his campaigns against the guerrillas.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>Without a clear explanation to the United States, Russia has backed away from signing an agreement on non-strategic missile defenses allowed under the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>In New York last month, Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia and Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced agreement on lower-velocity anti-missile systems, with negotiations to open on higher-velocity systems that the United States is developing.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Deep inside the Kremlin, Anatoly B. Chubais is plotting how to carry out the next stage of Russia's democratic revolution.</p> <p>In a few months, Mr. Chubais, the 41-year-old chief of staff, has gone from political oblivion to become one of the most powerful behind-the-scenes figures in the Russian Government.</p>
['taxation', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>Worried by Russia's persistent failure to collect the taxes it needs to pay the costs of governing, the International Monetary Fund is expected to suspend further disbursement of a crucial $10 billion loan, officials said today.</p> <p>The report that Russia's Central Bank had failed to reach an agreement with the fund's experts was the latest sign that three months after President Boris N. Yeltsin won re-election, chronic tax evasion has emerged as his most pressing political problem.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'ethics', 'atomic energy']	<p>It began with an early-morning knock at the door. Aleksandr Nikitin, a researcher for a Norwegian environmental organization and a former Russian naval officer, was still asleep. But the security police insisted that he quickly dress and come along.</p> <p>Mr. Nikitin had no opportunity to alert friends or colleagues. The telephone line at his St. Petersburg apartment had been turned off.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a three-story villa in the wooded heights above the Bosporus, a small group of men in suits and ties were busy working the telephones to a dozen  world capitals, trying to set up peace conferences and commercial deals.</p> <p>''Qatar is on the phone,'' a secretary shouted, and Mansour Jachim czyk interrupted a conversation with an American woman in New York who specializes in ''negotiation deadlock'' to take the call from the Persian Gulf, slipping from English to Russian and then to his native Polish before reverting to English.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>As he prepares for his heart bypass operation, President Boris N. Yeltsin is not taking phone calls, meeting with aides or even glancing at briefing papers. His one liaison to the Kremlin and the political world roiling around it is the person who has in the last six months become his closest confidante and adviser -- his daughter, Tatyana Dyachenko.</p> <p>And while her father convalesces after his surgery, expected to take place within days, her influence on Kremlin decision-making will be even more pronounced.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A treaty banning chemical weapons worldwide is set to go into force next spring after the required number of ratifications was achieved this week with approval by Hungary.</p> <p>The treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling or use of these arms and calls for the destruction of existing stocks and the factories that produced them. The treaty, opened for signing in 1993 and signed by 160 nations, was scheduled  to go into effect 180 days after the 65th ratification.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>The Russian general, standing ramrod stiff in a business suit, waved aside another plate of American food. ''Bread, salt and onions,'' he requested.</p> <p>After a round of interviews with and speeches at many of America's opinion leaders, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed -- peacemaker of Chechnya, surprise political challenger to Yeltsin, recently bounced out of the Yeltsin Kremlin after pushing for too much power -- was relaxing at a reception given in the Bethesda home of businessman Fred Bush.</p>
['elections']	<p>Defying the West, East European nations and his own Parliament, President Aleksandr Lukashenko went ahead today with a referendum on giving himself near-absolute power.</p> <p>The vote, which took place only after Mr. Lukashenko fired the independent-minded head of the Central Election Commission, has sparked fears that Belarus, once part of the Soviet Union, is heading back toward a Soviet-style dictatorship.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Even if all  goes well for Boris N. Yeltsin  and today his doctors gave every reason to believe that it would -- it may be months before the Russian President can run this troubled country again.</p> <p>And when he does return to the Kremlin, many find it hard to imagine that he will be the same strong leader who has driven Russia for five years on a forced march away from Communism and toward a market economy.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin came out of a seven-hour, multiple-bypass heart operation in a hospital here on Tuesday with his doctors declaring the operation a success. They said they were optimistic about the 65-year-old Russian leader's chances of resuming a full workload.</p> <p>At a news conference in the hospital an hour after the operation, the doctors said the surgery went without a hitch. Mr. Yeltsin's heart was stopped for 68 minutes during one phase of the operation.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Draped in mists and surrounded by the unassailable snow-covered peaks of the Caucasus, the Chechen elders gathered on a hilltop here to thank Allah for bringing them victory in their war against Russia.</p> <p>They prayed on a giant tarpaulin and then ate lamb stewed for hours in vast black caldrons. It was a celebration without joy though, because, as the separatists' president, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, told the assembled villagers, ''War is very hard for our bodies but what is to come will be much harder for our souls.</p>
['medicine and health']	<p>When Boris N. Yeltsin was told in September that he needed a heart bypass operation, he promised the consulting American heart surgeon, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, that he would be a good patient.</p> <p>Until then, the Russian President had been anything but. Like many V.I.P.'s, executives, doctors and others who are accustomed to giving orders and controlling others every day, Mr. Yeltsin had trouble yielding some control to develop a partnership with his doctors.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Several hundred Muslims stormed a village today to reclaim homes formerly occupied by Muslims in an area now held by Bosnian Serbs, setting off a firefight.</p> <p>Heavily armed American and Russian peacekeepers swooped in to quell the fighting, and some international officials here said the episode illustrated the danger of reducing the number of outside troops in Bosnia.</p>
['elections', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>A Russian newspaper published today what it said was a transcript of a taped meeting that suggests that President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief of staff plotted to cover up a major financing scandal during this year's presidential campaign and then lied about it.</p> <p>The article in the muckraking Moskovsky Komsomolets was the latest volley in an increasingly vicious rivalry between Kremlin aides, present and past. The chief of staff, Anatoly B. Chubais, vehemently denied today that any such meeting had taken place and insisted that the recording was a fake planted by an official ousted in June, Maj. Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, who was once the powerful chief of presidential security and Mr. Yeltsin's closest confidant.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin underwent a long-awaited multiple-bypass heart operation early today at a cardiology institute here, the Kremlin announced.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin signed over his presidential powers to Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin before being anesthetized for the operation, which began shortly after 7 A.M. (11 P.M. Monday, Eastern time). It was expected to take several hours.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin made a show today of bouncing back from his quintuple bypass heart operation. Issuing a proclamation and engaging in a tug-of-war with his doctors over his postoperative care, he took his first steps since the surgery, which occurred on Tuesday.</p> <p>Although he has not yet appeared in public, he sought to reassert his authority by issuing a statement renaming this day -- long celebrated as Revolution Day -- a ''Day of National Accord and Reconciliation.'' He said this would commemorate victims of revolution, civil war and political repression.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'crime and criminals', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>In a grisly new demonstration of the growing audacity of Moscow's criminal gangs, at least 13 people were killed this morning and dozens more wounded when a remote-controlled bomb ripped through a crowd of mourners at a memorial service at a cemetery here.</p> <p>Nearly 150 people had gathered at the Kotlyakovskoye Cemetery to pay tribute to Mikhail Likhodei, the leader of a group of Russian veterans of the war in Afghanistan, who was himself assassinated exactly two years ago today. At 11:30 a bomb, which had been buried beneath a metal table next to the grave, exploded with enough force to hurl those closest to it hundreds of feet through the air. Investigators were still searching for body parts in the trees and among the grave stones this evening.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'taxation']	<p>More than a dozen employees at St. Petersburg's nuclear power plant took over the control room on Thursday and threatened to shut down the plant that provides most of the city's power unless they received months' worth of back pay.  This morning 400 of their colleagues joined the protest, and announced a hunger strike. Federal officials rushed to the scene to assess the hazard.</p> <p>By noon today, the Government had flown more than a billion rubles -- $200 for each worker -- to the plant and promised to deliver the rest within a week.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin's heart function has improved significantly since his bypass surgery last month and his recuperation continues smoothly, according to an American consultant in the Russian President's case.</p> <p>''He is doing just beautifully,'' the consultant, Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said in a telephone interview Wednesday night, hours after talking with Mr. Yeltsin's surgeon, Dr. Renat S. Akchurin, in Moscow.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Two months after he was abruptly forced out as President Boris N. Yeltsin's national security adviser, a confident and defiant Aleksandr I. Lebed announced today that he was forming a new political party to mount a drive for the Kremlin.</p> <p>Mr. Lebed asserted that his new party had the backing of banks and wealthy financiers and would give voters a third choice besides the Communists and Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>This week marks the fifth anniversary of the breakup of the Soviet Union, perhaps the most astonishing single event in the second half of the 20th century. The collapse combined at least three-and-a-half revolutions in one. Leninist politics were to be supplanted by democratic pluralism; Stalinist economics, by private ownership and the market; the czarist empire, by a dozen suddenly independent states, and what little was left of the cold war in 1991, by rapturous Russian-American partnership.</p> <p>Five years are hardly enough time for a final verdict on changes of this magnitude, but they are enough for provisional judgments about what's working and what isn't, and where re-thinking is needed. Some surprising conclusions suggest themselves. Those transformations that aroused the deepest doubts five years ago -- that led serious people to ask whether Russia was really ready for westernization -- have generally gone better than the doubters expected.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>When neighbors came to Mullah Mohammed Omar in the spring of 1994, they had a story that was shocking even by the grim standards of Afghanistan's 18-year-old civil war.</p> <p>Two teen-age girls from the mullah's village of Singesar had been abducted by one of the gangs of mujahedeen, or ''holy warriors,'' who controlled much of the Afghan countryside. The girls' heads had been shaved, they had been taken to a checkpoint outside the village and they had been repeatedly raped.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In the worst premeditated attack in the 133-year history of the International Committee of the Red Cross, six Western aid workers were shot and killed in their sleep early this morning in the separatist republic of Chechnya.</p> <p>Five women, four of them nurses, and one man, a construction worker, were shot with automatic weapons by masked gunmen who broke into their guarded hospital compound before dawn. One critically wounded survivor was evacuated to Geneva.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>For more than a century, the distinctive emblem of the International Committee of the Red Cross has been recognized as a banner of neutrality, enabling its doctors and nurses to treat soldiers and civilians on both sides in the world's most brutal war zones.</p> <p>Now, however, the ethnic conflicts that have blotted the post-cold-war era have proven far more dangerous for the Red Cross, and yesterday's killing of six Red Cross workers in Chechnya brought those new risks into sharp relief.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>Despite its continuing vigorous objection to NATO's plans to expand into Central Europe, Russia accepted the alliance's offer today to negotiate a separate formal security relationship with Moscow.</p> <p>''Russia, while still against enlargement, does realize that NATO is an important organization that plays an important role in Europe and, being pragmatists, we are certainly going to base ourselves on that,''  Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov said after meeting this morning with the 16 allies here.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>NATO took the first formal step today to expand its alliance to include formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe and then moved quickly to ease Russia's apprehensions by offering to negotiate a special charter with Russia and to increase military cooperation and contacts.</p> <p>The foreign ministers of NATO's 16 member nations, meeting at the alliance's headquarters near here, also sought to reassure Russia by pledging that the alliance had ''no intention, no plan and no reason'' to move nuclear weapons in the territory of any new members.</p>
['international trade and world market']	<p>There would be enough on the foreign policy plate even if this President were preoccupied with foreign policy. If President Clinton's first term was about minimalist goals -- intervening when absolutely necessary to stop the killing in Haiti and Bosnia, finding a workable China policy, helping to keep Russia from falling apart -- his second term is inevitably more ambitious.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton would like to preside over an expanded NATO, a Syrian-Israeli settlement in the Middle East, peace in Northern Ireland, and a relationship with both Russia and China that anchors them in the obligations of the community of nations.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Responding to repeated American appeals, Russia promised today to remove a cache of nuclear material from Georgia by March.</p> <p>The supply of highly enriched uranium and spent nuclear fuel at a research reactor outside Tbilisi in the Caucasus has been a major worry for American officials, who fear that it could fall into the hands of aspiring nuclear powers or terrorists.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Expressing unusual confidence that it has finally become possible to resolve the biggest diplomatic chasm separating Russia and the West, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany predicted today that the standoff over NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe would end this year.</p> <p>''I think that this year we will find a rational solution which will make NATO enlargement possible and will at the same time respect the security interests of all partners concerned,'' Mr. Kohl said at a news conference here after three hours of talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States has been making a quiet effort to have a cache of nuclear material moved out of this volatile region of the former Soviet Union, according to American and Georgian officials.</p> <p>But the operation to get the material out of Georgia, which is part of a broader program to stem the theft of nuclear bomb ingredients from Russia and its neighbors, has thus far been thwarted by months of diplomatic impasse between Russia and the United States.</p>
['elections']	<p>The war is over, and now the battle for control over the secessionist republic of Chechnya is being waged on the airwaves.</p> <p>On one small privately-owned channel, Aslan Maskhadov, prime minister and chief of staff of the Chechen forces in the war, stares into the camera wearing a civilian pullover and jacket and slowly tells the story of his life, starting with his birth and youthful efforts to enter a Soviet military academy against his mother's wishes.</p>
['elections']	<p>Vowing to secure independence from Russia, the Chechen military chief of staff who led and won the rebel republic's war against Moscow's forces declared victory today in the presidential election on Monday.</p> <p>''We already declared independence in 1991,'' the military chief, Aslan Maskhadov, 45, said gravely at a news conference here in the Chechen capital today. ''All that remains is that our independence must be recognized by all states, including Russia.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>During his swing through the corridors of America's business world this week, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired general who aspires to be the next President of Russia, hobnobbed with executives at Du Pont in Delaware and sipped tea with Wall Street investors at the Harvard Club in Manhattan.</p> <p>And then he dropped in on the man who aspires to be the king of New York capitalism.</p>
['elections']	<p>The newly elected President of Chechnya served most of his life in the Soviet Army to reach the rank of colonel, but he never saw combat until Russian tanks rolled into the secessionist republic in December 1994 and he began plotting strategy against his former fellow officers.</p> <p>Aslan Maskhadov, 45, won overwhelmingly on Monday in elections in Chechnya that foreign and Russian observers alike deemed fair and democratic. He is deeply popular with voters. He is grudgingly respected by at least some in the Russian Government. But his mandate is not open-ended: He promised to deliver independence, and Chechen voters are as wedded to the idea as Russia is adamantly opposed to it.</p>
['elections']	<p>In this village of 7,000 people in the southern Russian republic of Chechnya, two Western election observers sat stiffly in the unexpectedly opulent house of their host, Suliman Akmatov, a businessman who is chairman of the local election commission. They smiled uneasily at their election-eve entourage: the chief of police, his deputy, four other armed guards, and several armed and fierce-looking well-wishers ordered to accompany them on their rounds.</p> <p>''As long as they are in my house and in my custody, I know nothing bad will happen to them,'' Mr. Akmatov said firmly. ''We are not letting anything with these elections go wrong.''</p>
['accidents and safety', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>With the American flag fluttering from his limousine, the top United States diplomat here rode out of his embassy on Thursday.</p> <p>But no sooner had the car belonging to the diplomat, John Tefft,  passed through the embassy gates than it was stopped by the Russian traffic police on Moscow's Garden Ring road.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The Georgians were the last to know. Without even a hint of consultation with this country's authorities, the Russian border guards who still patrol Georgia's frontiers seized the Almaz, a Ukrainian ship, recently and took it to the Georgian port of Batumi.</p> <p>After being spirited to Russia and charged with smuggling during a previous port call in Russia, the Ukrainian sailors were released.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>In advertising terms, Madeleine K. Albright has had her national rollout as the new Secretary of State. She has laid down her themes of bipartisanship, global responsibility and public diplomacy, and through appointments and symbolism has tried to yank the center of foreign policy-making back into the State Department.</p> <p>Today she took her show on the road, to nine countries in Europe and Asia, mixing traditional allies with foreign policy challenges. Though her first trip abroad as Secretary of State will have ample symbolism, these 10 days also mark a first serious effort to grapple with the issues.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'espionage']	<p>''I grew up with the cold war,'' Francis Gary Powers Jr. says with pride. ''Whenever we had show and tell at school, I always brought my dad.''</p> <p>Powers (at right) is standing in an exhibit hall at Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Va. A portion of the space is devoted to his deceased father -- Francis Gary Powers Sr., the cold-war icon whose U-2 photo-reconnaissance plane was shot down on May 1, 1960, as he flew over Soviet airspace. Mounted, in part, to help kick off the C.I.A.'s 50th anniversary year, this exhibit comes with a catch: you aren't allowed to see it. ''We're not open to the public,'' says Midge Holmes, a friendly spokeswoman. ''That would create too many security problems.''</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Ousted from power and roundly condemned by Russian reformers, the shadowy former bodyguard of President Boris N. Yeltsin clawed his way back into the political ring today by winning a seat in Parliament.</p> <p>No sooner did Aleksandr V. Korzhakov win the race to represent Tula, an ailing industrial area 120 miles south of Moscow, than he began to hint darkly about his desire to even the score with Yeltsin aides and perhaps even the President himself.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'law and legislation']	<p>The first Russian consul ever based in Seattle has so brimmed with post-cold-war good will during his four years here that he has handed out, by his count, more than 4,400 business cards.</p> <p>In his 25-year diplomatic career, Georgy Vlaskin has never felt such affinity toward the people where he was posted, he says, and he is proud to have helped Russian trade with the State of Washington balloon from tens of millions of dollars a year to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, after meetings with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, said today that Moscow remained opposed to an enlarged NATO and confused by its aims.</p> <p>But he called for continuing discussions with Washington about European security and said that ''if our concerns are taken into account and NATO adapts, I do not exclude the possibility of concluding a document on the basics of the relationship between Russia and NATO.''</p>
['treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>As it fights to persuade the Senate to approve a treaty banning chemical weapons, officials said today, the Clinton Administration has asked Moscow to stop producing a lethal nerve gas that has caused concern among Republicans over whether the pact can be effective.</p> <p>Administration officials said the Russians have not responded directly. Moscow has signed the pact, the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, but has not ratified it.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Kremlin cover story about Boris Yeltsin's disability is that he is recuperating from double pneumonia. According to some independent medical minds, Yeltsin is at risk of suffering from the memory impairment that often follows extensive heart surgery.</p> <p>Though the Russian leader ain't dead yet, vultures are circling. In the old Soviet days, decrepitude in high places could be concealed; today, the tottering at the top is televised and has precipitated a paroxysm of Machiavellian maneuvering.</p>
['books and literature', 'biographical information']	<p>As Turkey settles into what is likely to be an extended confrontation between secular and pro-Islamic forces, symbols take on exaggerated political importance for both sides.</p> <p>Perhaps no individual crystallizes the conflict better than Nazim Hikmet, atheist and Communist and also one of the greatest literary figures ever to emerge from this country.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov are scheduled to meet in Moscow on Thursday to discuss ways to strengthen ties between NATO and Russia -- despite Russian objections to the alliance's decision to bring in new members. The chances of progress will be greater if the Russians understand not just the inevitability of enlargement, but the reasons for it.</p> <p>The decision to expand the alliance began with a question. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, should there remain, on the landscape of Europe, a military alliance or should NATO retire voluntarily to the ash heap of history?</p>

''Profit!'' shouted a pigtailed 7-year-old girl named Dasha. The teacher continued, ''And why does Misha need this profit?''</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a significant move aimed at placating Russian opposition to NATO's planned expansion eastward, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will take to Moscow new proposals to reduce conventional weapons sharply in Central and Eastern Europe, senior American and alliance officials said today.</p> <p>In her first major speech overseas as Secretary of State, speaking to a meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels, Ms. Albright also proposed a joint NATO-Russian unit that could be used for peacekeeping. Though short on details, Ms. Albright cited the model of Bosnia and explained the proposal as another way to convince Moscow that cooperation with NATO can be peaceful and permanent.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today presented the Kremlin with a new arms control proposal that would freeze military forces near Russia's European periphery, the West's first detailed response to Russian anxieties about NATO expansion.</p> <p>The proposal, which was outlined by senior Western officials on condition that they not be identified, is part of a broader American arms control plan that seeks to persuade Moscow that the expansion of NATO would not bring the alliance's military might to Russia's doorstep.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived here for a first round of talks with Russian leaders, American officials sought today to lower expectations about any quick Russian acquiescence to NATO expansion.</p> <p>Ms. Albright brings a package of proposals designed to convince Moscow that an expanded NATO would not be an aggressive alliance, and could lead to a Europe armed with fewer weapons than  the Russians face now.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Vice President Al Gore sat down today for two days of talks here with the Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, hoping to inject movement into an American-Russian relationship that has been stagnant for six months because of President Boris N. Yeltsin's infirmity.</p> <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin told reporters a summit meeting between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin would be held in March as scheduled, in the second half of the month; American officials cautioned that a date was not yet fixed. While it is Mr. Yeltsin's turn to come to Washington, American officials have offered to meet in Moscow or elsewhere in Europe.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The most star-studded and bizarre election in Russia's short experiment with democracy is to be held here on Sunday, and it has just about driven Aleksei Avdoshin around the bend.</p> <p>Mr. Avdoshin, 47, is a bus driver, and like a lot of people in this central Russian city he has not been paid in months. So when he heard that one candidate for Parliament was handing out vodka and tea to voters by the truckload, he thought he had found his man. That candidate was Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Korzhakov, 46, who is President Boris N. Yeltsin's archenemy and former best friend.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>In the last 10 years, Boris Kanishev has endured all the broken promises and flat-out lies a man can handle. A union leader in this city best known as the center of Russian airplane design, he has watched in dismay as the enormous industry has withered to nothing.</p> <p>Mr. Kanishev considers himself a reform-minded politician. He voted for Boris Yeltsin in last year's presidential election because, he said today, ''Communism is a thing of the past.''</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to differ over NATO expansion but formally determined that Russia would negotiate its own partnership agreement with the military alliance that would be signed before NATO began adding members in July.</p> <p>Ending their two-day summit meeting here with statements intended to demonstrate the strength of their cooperation, the two leaders also reported making several breakthroughs in arms control.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>His misstep on Friday on dimly lighted stairs forced President Clinton today to delay this week's planned meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia by one day.</p> <p>In a minivan borrowed to accommodate his wheelchair, Mr. Clinton returned to the White House before noon today, ahead of schedule. Both he and his doctors said he was recovering well from surgery on Friday to stitch a torn tendon back to his right kneecap.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The White House moved quickly today to answer senior Republicans' criticism of an agreement governing missile defenses that President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signed in Helsinki, Finland.</p> <p>The agreement sets out distinctions between shorter-range missile defenses, which are built to protect troops and ships, and defenses against longer-range strategic missiles, which are all but banned under the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty, known as the ABM treaty.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends', 'law and legislation']	<p>Ask most Russians about this grimy old center for gunsmiths and ironmongers and you can expect a long, blank stare. Few know it was once a mighty seat of war: the thunderous cannon that drove Napoleon from Russia were made here, and in time the city's factories graduated to the Kalashnikov rifle and the ballistic missile.</p> <p>For decades the region around Izhevsk, known as Udmurtiya -- closed, snowbound and forgotten -- was simply another Soviet secret that nobody wanted to know. Not anymore, though.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin began a two-day summit meeting here today, with the United States signaling its willingness to make further arms control concessions and a conciliatory Mr. Yeltsin stressing that the two leaders  must ''depart as friends as we've done in the past.''</p> <p>In their first meeting in nearly a year, the two men dined together for more than two hours on salmon and reindeer, red and white wine and Champagne in the presidential palace along with their host, President Martti Ahtisaari.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>For 40 years, Helsinki had been  known mainly for saunas, spying and summitry. Finland, the tiny Nordic neighbor of the vast Communist empire, kept its hard-won independence  after World War II by pledging a friendship for the Soviet Union that it never really felt.</p> <p>Forced by geography and the cold-war balance of power to placate Moscow, Finland called itself neutral. The world called its precarious condition Finlandization.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Two simple facts define the geopolitical landscape today -- Russian weakness and Chinese strength. In the North Atlantic, across Eurasia, in East Asia, these two realities form the backdrop against which daily events occur, from the chaos in Albania to the cautiousness in Hong Kong. Yet increasingly the Clinton Administration's foreign policy looks as if it were intended to meet precisely the opposite challenges.</p> <p>As Russia continues its political bumbling, economic muddling and military retrenchment, the Administration is spending vast amounts of time, energy, money and political capital to deter it from launching an invasion of Central Europe.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>After months of illness and seclusion, a visibly reinvigorated President Boris N. Yeltsin, 66, promised today to clean house in his administration and speed up free-market reform.</p> <p>The cornerstone, he said, would be new faces in power.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Every Sunday evening, Russia's most influential television news program unveils a new tale of intrigue and corruption.</p> <p>The targets are President Boris N. Yeltsin's old cronies and new political foes. The anchorman is Yevgeny Kiselyov, a dapper correspondent for NTV, who is Russia's Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw rolled into one.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The joke on the phone from Moscow has two guys in the front seat of a speeding car. One shouts ''Turn the wheel! We're going to crash!'' and the other says ''I can't.'' ''But there's a stone wall ahead -- turn now!'' ''Can't.'' ''Why not?'' ''Because you have the wheel.''</p> <p>Boris Yeltsin has the wheel and is shouting at others to turn Russia's economy from disaster. He's six months late and $10 billion short in payments of wages to teachers, the police and the military. Unions plan an all-Russia general strike at the end of the month.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>While focused on NATO expansion and Russia's place in a new Europe, the summit meeting between Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin in Helsinki last week also produced important progress on arms control.</p> <p>While nuclear weapons used to be the central issue between the Soviet Union and the United States, Moscow and Washington now want stability at lower, safer and cheaper levels of armament and expenditure.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>''I know you trust me,'' Boris N. Yeltsin once told Bill Clinton, American officials say. ''But I know it's because you are afraid of what may come after me.''</p> <p>As much as the Clinton Administration is accused of personalizing Russian politics in its devotion to Mr. Yeltsin -- an accusation similarly leveled at the Bush Administration for its loyalty to Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- the summit meeting here this week showed the value of Mr. Clinton's trust.</p>
['medicine and health', 'accidents and safety', 'news and news media', 'biographical information']	<p>President Clinton underwent successful surgery this afternoon to reattach a tendon that tore from his right kneecap with a loud pop when he stumbled down shadowy steps outside the golfer Greg Norman's house in Florida early this morning.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton received only an epidural anesthetic to numb his lower body during the surgery, which lasted 2 hours 4 minutes. He was never unconscious, his doctors said, and so power was never transferred to the Vice President as the 25th Amendment of the Constitution provides in cases where the President is incapacitated.</p>
['finances', 'elections']	<p>A leading candidate for ambassador to France has withdrawn, tired of waiting for the call from the White House. There is no American ambassador in important countries, like Russia, Japan and Germany. And many top jobs under Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright await appointees.</p> <p>Two months into President Clinton's second term, the selection of the senior diplomatic corps has bogged down, a victim of White House indecision caused in part by the furor over campaign financing.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Answering critics who accuse him of capitulating to the West on NATO expansion, President Boris N. Yeltsin today defended his conciliatory stance at his summit meeting in Helsinki last week with President Clinton.</p> <p>''Of course, we could have furrowed our brows and pounded the table with our shoes as happened during the cold war years,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in a radio address broadcast today. ''But what would that have achieved? Another round of irreconcilable enmity, a new isolation for Russia.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>If you have any doubts that the cold war is over, I suggest you watch CNN's coverage of Albania.</p> <p>The CNN reports usually begin by showing a map of the sea off Albania. On this map are little ships, each representing one of the U.S. and other foreign naval vessels that have rushed to Albania's shores. In the cold war, the ships on that map would have been U.S. and Soviet warships competing over who would get into Albania first, fill the vacuum there and thus gain an edge in the worldwide superpower competition. In the new era, an era defined not by the cold war but by globalization, the game is different: The winner is the country whose navy gets its citizens out of Albania first and gets away the fastest. Today, the loser occupies Albania; the winner evacuates Albania.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The summit meeting that begins here on Thursday caps a month of intensive bargaining and diplomatic courtship that American officials hope will lead to grudging Russian tolerance of a plan to expand the NATO alliance eastward.</p> <p>As advance parties awaited the arrival on Thursday of Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin for two days of talks, Americans today described a campaign of military reassurances and economic inducements that they predict will allow Mr. Yeltsin to leave Helsinki declaring that he has fully defended Russian honor. $(President Clinton left Washington shortly after 9 P.M. Wednesday.$)</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin filled the senior ranks of the Russian Cabinet with economic reformers today, making good on his pledge to overhaul his Government and quicken the pace of economic change.</p> <p>The shake-up, which gave Russia its most aggressively market-oriented Government since 1992, is aimed primarily at reviving a stalled economic program that has created fertile ground for Mr. Yeltsin's political opponents.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After meeting President Clinton today, Yevgeny M. Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, emphasized Moscow's openness to a new relationship with NATO but maintained a tough public stance against the alliance's expansion.</p> <p>Mr. Primakov met Mr. Clinton, who is recovering from knee surgery, for an hour in the family quarters of the White House. He emerged to stress the ''extreme importance'' of the summit meeting this week in Helsinki, Finland, for Russia's overall relations with the United States.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Under intense political fire at home, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel sought a reprieve in Moscow today, focusing on improving economic ties to Russia and courting Russia's newly assertive Jewish minority.</p> <p>Mr. Netanyahu, on his first official visit to Russia, held two packed meetings with Jewish leaders, one in a Moscow synagogue, another in the Kolonny Zal, the vast, august government building where Stalin and other Communist leaders once lay in state.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'religion and churches', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In a setback for the United States, the Security Council issued a statement today that did not condemn Iraq for violating sanctions by flying a group of Muslims to Saudi Arabia last week without United Nations permission so they could make the pilgrimage to Mecca.</p> <p>After four days of tortuous diplomacy, the Council issued a unanimous statement that failed to say whether the flight violated sanctions  imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 or deliver even the mildest rebuke to Iraq after China and Egypt, with varying degrees of support from Russia and France, took a firm stand against criticizing Baghdad.</p>
['currency', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>The Presidents of Russia and neighboring Belarus initialed a charter today that would pave the way for a union of the two republics.</p> <p>But the charter, hastily rewritten in Moscow on the eve of the meeting, was a watered-down version of the more ambitious document on full integration that President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Belarussian counterpart, Aleksandr R. Lukashenko, had been prepared to sign.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'religion and churches', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>An American-led campaign to persuade the Security Council to condemn Saddam Hussein for sending a planeload of Iraqi pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, in what the United States says is a violation of United Nations sanctions, appears to be in trouble.</p> <p>In two days of discussion, France, China, Russia and Guinea-Bissau all questioned whether the flight was a serious violation of sanctions slapped on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The Security Council adjourned on Friday night, agreeing to reconvene on Monday.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Most Russians assume that Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin does not live off his Government salary of $770 a month. As a former chairman of Gazprom, the formerly state-owned natural gas monopoly that is now one of Russia's most lucrative companies, Mr. Chernomyrdin is viewed as a wealthy man, perhaps one of Russia's wealthiest.</p> <p>So few Russians were surprised last month when Izvestia, one of the country's most respected newspapers, printed an article that said Mr. Chernomyrdin had amassed a private fortune worth $5 billion.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In more than five years as Governor, Boris Nemtsov has labored mightily to make this Volga River region a bastion of free-market reform.</p> <p>He and his youthful aides courted Western investors. They tried to nurture small businesses. They transformed the cityscape, which now boasts a trade fair and a pedestrian shopping mall.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Jiang Zemin of China pledged today to work together to limit American power and influence in the world.</p> <p>In a summit meeting at the start of a five-day state visit that was laden with political symbolism, the two leaders did not single out the United States by name. But their message, aimed in part at a Russian public that has been bombarded with alarmist reports about NATO expansion and the United States role as the sole remaining superpower, was clear.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Russia vowed today to strengthen ties with Iran while Western European nations distanced themselves from Teheran after a German court blamed the Iranian Government for ordering the assassination of exiled dissidents.</p> <p>''We have good, positive cooperation with Iran, which shows a tendency to grow,'' President Boris N. Yeltsin said today during talks with an Iranian visitor, Ali Akbar Nateq-Noori, the head of the Iranian Parliament. In a unusual bipartisan display, Mr. Yeltsin's warm words were echoed by Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the Russian Parliament.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Responding to American and Israeli appeals, Ukraine has decided against providing turbines for the nuclear reactor that Russia is selling to Iran.</p> <p>The decision is a victory for Western efforts to curtail nuclear cooperation with Iran. American officials said they hoped it would delay the Russian project but did not expect it to prevent the sale of the reactor.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As President Clinton left for Paris today for a ceremony intended to clear the way for NATO expansion, Administration officials prepared for a long, hard struggle to win Senate support for the extension of formal security guarantees to former Soviet-bloc nations.</p> <p>While the signing on Tuesday of a new agreement between Russia and the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization smoothes over Russia's opposition to the enlargement of its cold-war military adversary, questions about the expansion of the alliance are growing at home.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>When President Boris N. Yeltsin wants to play the nationalist card he simply rolls out the red carpet for the United States' most vexing rivals and bitter adversaries.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Russia has ostentatiously turned toward the East, inviting officials from China, India and Iran. Mr. Yeltsin has posed for the cameras hugging the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, and Russian officials have boasted of fashioning a ''multipolar world'' in which the United States would no longer be the dominant player.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Russia and Belarus agreed today to form a new union, a largely symbolic move intended to appeal to nostalgia for the old Soviet empire.</p> <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin signed the accord with the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, in a grand Kremlin ceremony. ''Our union is aimed at forging further relations of brotherhood, friendship and all-around cooperation,'' Mr. Yeltsin declared.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>The Russian Government's top national security official said today that NATO's decision to expand had hurt the chances that Parliament would approve the latest strategic arms reduction treaty negotiated with the United States.</p> <p>The official, Ivan P. Rybkin, head of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Security Council, said in an interview that parliamentary ratification of the so-called Start 2 treaty was ''almost impossible.''</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Does Ken Starr do diplomacy?</p> <p>I ask because it's now clear that NATO expansion is the Whitewater of the Clinton foreign policy. Like Whitewater, NATO expansion began with a poorly financed, poorly conceived real estate deal, sold to Bill Clinton by fast-talking policy hucksters. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, the Clintons were told, would be brought into NATO, it would cost the Clintons (and America) virtually nothing, and when the deal was over Mr. Clinton's place in history would be elevated, NATO would be stronger, Europe more secure and Russia more pliable. The President thought about NATO expansion about as long as he thought about Whitewater, plunked down his money and has been paying ever since.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Fifty years ago the Mar shall Plan united  but also divided -- Europe. In editorials and commencement addresses we celebrate it today as an unparalleled act of enlightened generosity.</p> <p>That it was. Through an infusion of American money much of Western Europe was restored to prosperity and democracy.</p>
['books and literature', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>The re-election of President Boris N. Yeltsin over his Communist challenger last year was a pivotal moment in Russia's rocky transition to democracy. So it is not surprising that a roman a clef about that no-holds-barred campaign should follow.</p> <p>A new novel, ''China Lane,'' which purports to be the Russian version of ''Primary Colors,'' has just arrived in bookstores. Among the sinister players maneuvering behind the Kremlin campaign scenes are corrupt, mob-tied Government officials and political advisers, ruthless Russian and American businessmen and the President's daughter, ''Tan Yel.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>The architect of Russia's economic reform program, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, said today that he would stop working with the Harvard institute that had lent him its brightest economists to assist Russia's rocky transition to a market system.</p> <p>The decision followed the dismissal of two consultants from the prestigious Harvard Institute for International Development. American officials accused the two men of misusing their positions for personal gain.  Mr. Chubais had worked with the two men for years.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>For more than a decade, the chancery building of the United States Embassy in Moscow -- red brick, empty and forlorn -- was a historical landmark, a cautionary monument to cold war espionage.</p> <p>Seven years of construction slammed to a shuddering halt in 1985. The chancery, or embassy office building, was never occupied. Shamefaced American officials belatedly discovered tens of thousands of microscopic listening devices embedded in its concrete walls and sealed off the entire structure.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>Corruption in high places is hardly new in Russia, but political sex scandals are almost unknown. So a popular tabloid newspaper created a sensation when it published pictures of what it described as Russia's Minister of Justice cavorting nude with three naked women in a sauna frequented by gangsters.</p> <p>Valentin A. Kovalyov, the Justice Minister, denied the allegations, saying that the pictures published last weekend were fakes leaked by enemies seeking to sidetrack his efforts to crack down on organized crime. He said he would take a leave of absence, then continued showing up for work this week. Today President Boris N. Yeltsin formally suspended Mr. Kovalyov until an investigation is complete. But it remains unclear exactly what is being investigated.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>The Federal appeals court here has unanimously ruled that a Russian lesbian living in the United States can seek political asylum in this country because of efforts by the Russian Government to forcibly ''cure'' her of homosexuality.</p> <p>The decision, announced on Tuesday by a three-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, overturned a 1995 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals denying asylum to the Russian woman, Alla Pitcherskaia, who has lived in San Francisco since 1992.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States, France and Russia have reached agreement to toughen sanctions against Iraq unless United Nations inspectors can certify that Baghdad is fully cooperating in efforts to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, officials meeting here said today.</p> <p>After the agreement was reached here, the United Nations Security Council, meeting in New York, adpoted a resolution late tonight threatening Iraq with the tougher measures.</p>
['treaties']	<p>After years of doubt and tensions, the Presidents of Russia and Ukraine today signed a friendship treaty designed to strengthen the weak bonds between the two Slavic states.</p> <p>The treaty was signed in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on Boris N. Yeltsin's first trip there as President of Russia. Many previous visits were scheduled or considered, but all were postponed because of tensions over the future of the Black Sea Fleet, territorial disputes in the ethnic Russian region of Crimea, which is part of Ukraine, and other issues.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After the failed Communist coup in August 1991, America decided that true democracy had finally come to Russia. But that was far from true, because the old Soviet nomenklatura, including Boris Yeltsin, was still in place.</p> <p>The brief period of liberal Government, under Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, ended in May 1992. When he was replaced some months later by Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia regressed to a replica of the old Soviet system, with different titles. The bureaucracy, the absence of civil society, the existence of the old Soviet monopolies all created obstacles for people who wanted to live differently or start their own businesses.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>Setting the stage for a sharp political and constitutional battle, a spokesman for President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that the President planned to remove from office the rebellious -- but extremely powerful and independently elected -- Governor of one of Russia's largest regions.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin has never before removed an elected leader, an action for which he could invoke a vague provision of the Constitution that requires the President to protect the people of the country.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'international trade and world market']	<p>AEROFLOT has long held a worldwide reputation for rude service, disgusting food and scary landings. Comedians have made Aeroflot jokes for decades. Now the Russian airline is making fun of itself.</p> <p>In its first big multimedia advertising campaign, Aeroflot has chosen a new image for itself: a flying elephant.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The leaders of the eight countries that together represent about half of the world's economic activity called today for rapid democratic elections in Hong Kong, renewed energy to break the stalemate in the Middle East, a new commitment to peace in Bosnia, and new aid for Africa.</p> <p>But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations that dominated this morning's final session of ''The Summit of the Eight,'' President Clinton refused to commit the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, agreeing only to ''substantial reductions'' by 2010.</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us', 'law and legislation']	<p>Defying Parliament and the powerful Russian Orthodox Church, President Boris N. Yeltsin today rejected a bill that would sharply curtail religious freedom in Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's was a difficult choice between conscience and expedience, and the decision is bound to have painful political repercussions for him. The law was passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Parliament in an effort to protect the Russian Orthodox Church from competition from other religions.</p>
['computers and the internet', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>After heavy lobbying by the computer industry and the Clinton Administration, the Senate today rejected a proposal to tighten control of the sale of American supercomputers to China and Russia and instead voted for further study of the issue.</p> <p>The question of whether to tighten supercomputer export controls will now be resolved in a conference with the House of Representatives, which last month overwhelmingly passed a measure requiring a license for sales of some computers to countries such as China and Russia. The different Senate and House measures are attached to the Defense Authorization Act.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>The United States, Russia and 28 other nations agreed today on the framework for a treaty to reduce the number of tanks and other non-nuclear weapons in Europe, especially in Central European countries of the former Warsaw Pact.</p> <p>The agreement would replace -- and go further than -- a 1990 accord on conventional arms between NATO and nations that were then members of the Soviet bloc.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>An unusually calm and apparently forthright Boris N. Yeltsin, speaking to the Russian people on the anniversary of his re-election as President, asserted today for the first time that the battered Russian economy had finally emerged from its stark, five-year plunge into darkness.</p> <p>''That is it,'' Mr. Yeltsin announced today in a radio speech to the nation. ''We have reached the point when it is possible for production to go up. The decline has been stopped.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'computers and the internet']	<p>Addressing concerns over the sale of American supercomputers to Russia and China, the Clinton Administration added 13 foreign organizations today to its list of groups that are involved in secretly producing nuclear weapons and will now require special Federal approval to buy American technology.</p> <p>Six organizations in Russia and China will now be on ''an alert to exporters'' and additional names will be added soon, said William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, whose image has taken almost as much punishment as his body over the years, has finally decided to do something about it.</p> <p>''By decree of the President,'' announced Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman this afternoon, ''Tatyana Borisovna Dyachenko has been named adviser to the President.''</p>
['religion and churches', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In its first comprehensive review of persecution of Christian groups around the world, the United States Government sharply criticizes China for suppressing religious worship and urges  President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to veto legislation restricting religious freedom there.</p> <p>The State Department report, due to be issued on Tuesday and made available to The New York Times, was prepared at the behest of Congress, which last year demanded ''a detailed summary of United States policies designed to reduce and eliminate today's mounting persecution of Christians throughout the world.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'medicine and health', 'reform and reorganization', 'energy and power']	<p>The burning issue for Russians these days is not NATO expansion or President Boris N. Yeltsin's health. It is Mr. Yeltsin's plan to end housing and utility subsidies.</p> <p>In a politically risky move that has galvanized much of Russia, Mr. Yeltsin is pressing to phase out the enormous subsidies by 2003. The logic is clear. Six years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has emerged with an economy that is part free market and part socialist. Prices for food and clothing have soared, often exceeding those in the West. But most Russians still pay a pittance for shelter, leaving cash-strapped local governments to pick up most of the tab.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'finances']	<p>Overcoming efforts by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to delay the sale, one of Russia's most powerful banks plunged ahead today with an auction for one of the state's most valuable assets.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, since a subsidiary of Oneksim Bank was managing the bids, Oneksim Bank won 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest producers of nickel, copper and platinum.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>The most compelling event for Russians this year is not the drama aboard the Mir space station. It is the death of a humble clown turned actor.</p> <p>For two days, thousands of Russians have shuffled past a cordon of stern-eyed troops on Tsvetnoy Boulevard to pay their respects to Yuri Nikulin, who lay in state in the ring of his Moscow Circus.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>When Russia sold off a 25 percent share of the state's vast telephone and telecommunications monopoly last week, the Government proudly held up the deal as a model of fair play in the free market.</p> <p>This was different from previous  efforts to privatize huge state assets: the highest bid ($1.9 billion) actually won the auction.</p>
['ethics']	<p>Wading into one of the country's most bitter financial disputes, the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, criticized in a televised address today the handling of two recent, highly contested sales of state property and vowed to do better in the future.</p> <p>It was the first time Mr. Yeltsin had directly intervened in the simmering scandal, surrounding the  auctions of Svyazinvest, the telecommunications giant, and Norilsk Nickel, a major mining concern, but he waited until it was mostly over.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton Administration said today that Russia might have detonated a nuclear weapon on a remote Arctic island less than two weeks ago, in spite of its support for an international moratorium on nuclear tests. The Administration said it was investigating the matter and seeking an explanation from Moscow.</p> <p>Administration officials said ''a seismic event'' took place on Aug. 16 near Novaya Zemlya, an island where Russia maintains a nuclear testing site. The officials said that while it was not yet clear that the seismic activity was the result of a nuclear explosion, the activity could not readily be explained as a natural phenomenon, like an earthquake.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media']	<p>Even as an  international human rights organization met with the Belarussian authorities in Minsk to demand the release of three detained Russian reporters, President Boris N. Yeltsin  retracted criticism of the Belarussian President today, and promised that the journalists' detention would not affect their relationship.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch/Helsinki today published a searing 51-page report documenting President Aleksandr R. Lukashenko's systematic repression of civic organizations, opposition groups and the press. The report said Belarus ''bears an eerie and increasing resemblance to Soviet society.''</p>
['books and literature']	<p>Russia has no equivalent to the British royal family or America's Kennedy clan, but it does have a Kremlin. And right now, the telltale memoirs of a former aide to President Boris N. Yeltsin are providing Russians with their share of gossip and disgraceful misdeeds at the top.</p> <p>This, however, is scandal Russian style: no sex, just lots and lots of vodka and clumsy political intrigue.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'medicine and health', 'elections', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Five years ago, with the Russian economy in a deep depression and people overcome by fear and confusion, Lena Volkovskaya made a solemn vow to herself.</p> <p>''I promised I would never have children,'' the 32-year-old lawyer recalled recently. ''My friends were all the same way. There was no money here and no future here. It seemed very scary to me. We all decided that you would have to be crazy to bring a baby into this world.''</p>
['elections']	<p>In a closed-door meeting here today, Russia put the brakes on a proposal to have an international organization supervise elections that the Bosnia Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, has called in her power struggle with her predecessor, Radovan Karadzic.</p> <p>The Russian action is a setback for the Clinton Administration and major European Governments, which have openly sided with Ms. Plavsic in her political war, including her call for elections in the Serbian-controlled territory of Bosnia. She has formally requested the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to supervise the elections, which she would like to be held in October.</p>
['religion and churches', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Vice President Al Gore pressed the Yeltsin Government today to reject a new bill to protect the Russian Orthodox Church against competition from other Christian faiths.</p> <p>After a day of meetings, Mr. Gore said it was very unlikely that President Boris N. Yeltsin would veto the bill. But the Vice President held out the hope that Mr. Yeltsin and Russian lawmakers might modify the legislation.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After days of closed talks about the obstacles facing American oil companies in Russia, Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced a decision: They agreed to work on the problems over the next two months.</p> <p>From the moment Mr. Gore arrived in Russia, his strategy has been to nudge issues toward resolution. It is a deliberate approach that avoids open confrontation and minimizes the risk of embarrassing failure.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'computers and the internet']	<p>China has agreed to return to the United States a powerful supercomputer that was illegally transferred to a military institute earlier this year, Clinton Administration officials said today. They are trumpeting the case as a rare victory in controlling equipment that can aid in designing nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The officials said the computer, a powerful workstation produced by Sun Microsystems, was still at the Changsha Institute of Science and Technology, which is run by the Chinese military. But after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Commerce Department officials complained to their Chinese counterparts, China's trade ministry agreed to return the machine to the United States.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The United States signed a package of arms control agreements today with Russia that pushed back by five years one of the major treaties of the cold war, but that could clear the way for further cuts in nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The agreement would give Russia  until the end of 2007 to dismantle launching systems -- missile silos, bombers and submarines -- as required by the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 2. However, the systems must still be disabled by 2003.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The World Bank forecast today that growth in developing countries would accelerate over the next decade, and that the five biggest emerging economies -- China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia -- would become economic powerhouses in the next quarter-century.</p> <p>The bank forecast that growth in developing nations would surge to an average of 5.4 percent a year through 2006, up from 4.5 percent last year and 2.3 percent from 1991 through 1995.</p>
['ethics', 'finances', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>If Vice President Al Gore thought he would get away from questions about campaign finance once he had landed in Russia, he soon found out otherwise.</p> <p>No sooner had Mr. Gore arrived at  the Vnukovo airport in Moscow tonight than a Russian reporter asked him if the fund-raising allegations that had dogged him at home would hamper his effectiveness here.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>In the 80's, Israel's Mossad warned of nuclear weaponry being developed secretly by Saddam Hussein. The C.I.A. disagreed; ''not for 10 years'' was its complacent judgment, which warped Bush Administration policy. Now everyone admits that Mossad had it right.</p> <p>One year ago, Israel shared with our Defense Intelligence Agency Mossad's evidence and conclusions about a new proliferation threat from a supporter of terrorism.</p>
['international trade and world market']	<p>Eldar Porolashvili has been stranded here on the border between Georgia and Russia since mid-July, sleeping in a truck with 10 tons of raw alcohol for making vodka.</p> <p>Russia will not let him cross the border. The Georgian port where he picked up his load will not let him take it back. And Mr. Porolashvili, who will not be paid until he delivers his goods, does not have enough money or gas for a return trip even if he wanted to try his luck.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>When President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan arrived in Washington in August he was given a welcome that might have seemed out of place for the leader of a small and remote former Soviet republic.</p> <p>Mr. Aliyev's scheduled 30-minute meeting with President Clinton stretched to nearly two hours. He also met with Newt Gingrich and other Congressional leaders.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Decked out in his green general's uniform, Lev Rokhlin told his nascent political movement today that he had one overriding goal: the resignation of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>''As long as Yeltsin is in power, Russia will be dying!'' General Rokhlin bellowed, as a packed hall of more than 1,000 Communists, nationalists, veterans, Cossacks and other anti-Government delegates cheered.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Civilian scientists are strongly criticizing the Federal Government for saying that a seismic event that rocked the Russian wilds two months ago might have been an underground nuclear blast.</p> <p>The scientists say the tremor was unquestionably natural in origin, and they suggest that bureaucratic foes of the nuclear test ban treaty are distorting the truth in a bid to torpedo the treaty's ratification in the Senate.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Belarus has freed a reporter for a Russian television network in a case that has gravely strained the Slavic ties between the two states.</p> <p>The journalist, Pavel Sheremet, who is a citizen of Belarus and a reporter for Russia's ORT television network, was detained by Belarus border guards in July, accused of illegally trying to cross the border into Lithuania.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Secretary of State was saying that some of America's friends and allies ''don't get it.''</p> <p>Here is Iran, a ''prime example'' of what she said was the world's worst problem, the rogue states. Yet here is France ''pumping money'' into Iran; ''it passes my understanding.''</p>
['elections']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin often makes news with his announcements. But it was what Mr. Yeltsin did not say today that has got political analysts aflutter.</p> <p>During a visit to Nizhny Novgorod, a Volga River city 260 miles east of Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin was asked if he planned to run for a third term during the presidential elections in 2000.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Despite the personal intervention of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the United States is meeting sustained resistance in the Security Council to its plan for imposing new sanctions on Iraq, diplomats on the Council said today.</p> <p>With a vote on the issue likely to take place in the next few days, the United States is trying to negotiate a compromise that would leave the threat intact but postpone the date the additional sanctions would be applied.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>After years of ideological intransigence and increasing political irrelevance, all it really took today was a huff and a puff to bring the party of Lenin and Stalin to its knees.</p> <p>The Communist Party of Russia, which controls the country's toothless Parliament and not much else, promised this week to lead a vote of no confidence against the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. It was a showdown the party had planned for months, and after a weekend retreat at a secret location,  its leaders swore they were going to carry it out unless heads rolled and policies changed.</p>
['religion and churches', 'law and legislation']	<p>With its onion-domed churches and imposing walled monastery, this town had long been a symbol of the Russian Orthodox faith. Nestled among quiet streams and woodlands 130 miles east of the hustle and bustle of Moscow, it conveys a quiet serenity.</p> <p>But its calm is deceptive. With the stroke of a pen, President Boris N. Yeltsin transformed Suzdal into a potential battleground in Russia's new religious war.</p>
['medicine and health', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>George Soros, the Hungarian-born American financier and philanthropist, said yesterday that he would donate as much as $500 million in the next three years in Russia trying to improve health care, expand educational opportunities and help retrain the military for civilian jobs.</p> <p>In a telephone interview from Moscow, Mr. Soros said he would announce the initiative in eight fields  today. This latest gift would make him the leading philanthropist in Russia, as well as a donor whose presence exceeds that of the United States, which gave Russia $95 million in foreign aid last year.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>With a combination of deft diplomacy and superpower might, the Clinton Administration has vanquished Russia's attempt to block parliamentary elections in the Serbian region of Bosnia.</p> <p>''There will be an election on the 23d of November,'' a senior Clinton Administration official said, emphatically and triumphantly.</p>

Yale University Press. $30.</p> <p>In 1954, looking for an organization that could make contact with Russians in East Berlin and try to persuade them to defect, the Central Intelligence Agency recruited one Igor Grigorievich Orlov into a Russian emigre group based in Munich. Orlov, otherwise known as Sasha Kopazky, didn't last long in Munich, but he was to play an ambiguous role as a C.I.A. operative, one of whose tasks was to recruit women who could lure Soviet officers across the border to the West for interrogation. Strangely, however, his operations seemed to produce Russian officials who, in retrospect, seem to have remained under Soviet control from the beginning.</p> <p>The strange tale of Sasha, who went to the United States after his spying days were over and was later identified as a probable double agent, is one of the more intriguing stories told in ''Battleground Berlin,'' a volume in a continuing series of books being published by the Yale University Press that exploit the treasure of newly opened Soviet archives. This important work is crammed full of information about the murky and complicated battle between the Soviet and the American intelligence services between the end of World War II and the construction of the Berlin wall in 1961.</p>

['freedom and human rights', 'biographical information']	<p>The only sign of life amid the cluster of blackened, rotting wooden shacks is one that portends death: a freshly painted green guard tower that once loomed above the inmates of Perm 36, the most notorious labor camp for political prisoners in the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Figures like Natan Sharansky, Sergei Kovalyov, the writer Vladimir Bukovsky and the Ukrainian nationalist Levko Lukyanenko were among the 2,000 dissidents and artists who did time in this isolated prison complex in the Urals.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States lost its battle to impose new sanctions on Iraq today and settled for a Security Council resolution that would keep only a strong threat of added restrictions.</p> <p>Opposed by France, Russia, China, Egypt and Kenya, the United States and Britain had to draw back both from a plan to impose an immediate international travel ban on senior Iraqi military and intelligence officials and from an alternative proposal to put the ban into effect automatically in six months if Iraq continued to obstruct efforts to destroy its major weapons systems.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Russia's former privatization chief is being accused of receiving a bribe in a politically explosive case that has cast a cloud over the Yeltsin Government's program to sell billions of dollars in state assets.</p> <p>The Moscow prosecutor's office disclosed today that it was investigating a $100,000 book advance paid to the former official, Alfred R. Kokh, who was head of the privatization agency until mid-August.</p>
['terrorism', 'energy and power', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>French President Jacques Chirac met with Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to cook up an Iranian natural-gas deal that would (1) enrich their business interests, (2) gain a diplomatic foothold in the Persian Gulf by helping terrorists obtain missiles and (3) distract their restive unemployed by sticking a thumb in the U.S. eye.</p> <p>When Vice President Al Gore tried to brief his counterpart, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, on solid U.S. intelligence that Russian scientists were secretly helping the terrorist state of Iran build a 1,200-mile missile that would hold hostage the populations of Tel Aviv, Ankara and Riyadh, the American was tartly rebuffed.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Mark the date: Saddam Hussein returned to Mideast political glory on Oct. 23, 1997, in a chamber of the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>He did it by forcing America into one of its most humiliating retreats at the U.N. Saddam's victory was particularly tasty because it was given to him by four countries that America has befriended with blood, treasure, trade or all three. He has shown the Mideast that countries the U.S. had counted on would put his interests above America's, given the right price.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>Averting a political crisis, President Boris N. Yeltsin tonight staved off a parliamentary vote of no confidence in his Cabinet that could have severely undercut his economic reform effort.</p> <p>As faction leaders debated whether to put a no-confidence bill to a vote, Mr. Yeltsin telephoned the Parliament floor twice from the Kremlin, warning the deputies to desist.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The director general of a new organization monitoring the destruction of chemical weapons said today that unless Russia ratified the treaty banning their use within two weeks, Moscow will be cut out of critical decisions on the inspection system, weakening the accord significantly. Russia has the largest stockpile of chemical arms.</p> <p>The official, Jose Mauricio Bustani, head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said in an interview that for nations to attend an international conference beginning Dec. 1 to establish operating methods, they must have ratified the accord by Oct. 31. Nations must also turn over detailed information on chemical arms they possess or could produce.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In the next few weeks the Clinton Administration will face the first test of its willingness to make good on a threat to punish foreign companies that invest in Iran.</p> <p>But the State Department is not exactly leaping at the chance to teach a lesson to Russia's premier  private company, Gazprom, for a $2 billion deal with French and Malaysian companies to pump natural gas off the Iranian coast.</p>
['elections']	<p>Washington's desire for an election in the Serbian-controlled region of Bosnia in order to shore up the position of relative moderates there is facing continuing resistance from Moscow and Belgrade, diplomats here said today.</p> <p>The election was called by the Bosnian Serb President, Biljana Plavsic, who has been waging a bitter and sometimes violent struggle for power against her predecessor, Radovan Karadzic, who has been indicted on war-crimes charges.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'biographical information']	<p>In signs that both Iraq and the United States would like to step back from another conflict in the Persian Gulf, Iraq sent signals today that it did not want a military confrontation, and the United States persuaded Russia, once Iraq's strongest ally, to press Saddam Hussein to back down in the dispute over weapons inspections.</p> <p>In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that at a Cabinet meeting President Hussein ''stressed that Iraq was not seeking a confrontation with the American administration.''</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Clinton and the people he chose to help him steer American foreign policy have steered it straight into a collision that left it a near-wreck.</p> <p>The collision was not as much between the U.S. and Iraq as between Mr. Clinton's policies and America's own best interests.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia stepped up pressure today to hasten the process of declaring Iraq free of banned weapons, prompting the United States to stiffen its resistance and raising questions about how far Moscow will go -- alone if necessary -- in what is now seen here as a determined campaign to help Baghdad escape from sanctions.</p> <p>In the last few days, backstage diplomacy has turned to more open confrontation between Moscow and Washington, culminating tonight in a Russian attempt to block any Security Council action on the subject of Iraqi compliance unless Baghdad's progress in meeting disarmament requirements was emphasized.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Saddam Hussein has won a 3-in-1 victory, the biggest since he was allowed to live and rule after his defeat in the gulf war six years ago.</p> <p>Every part of his triumph violates the conditions for peace that were imposed by the wartime coalition against him, and by the U.N.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia followed up on its promise to help Iraq by asking today that the country be declared free of nuclear weapons and nearly free of prohibited missiles, diplomats said.</p> <p>Such declarations would bring Iraq a step closer to meeting the conditions for lifting the crushing economic sanctions imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The most frightening thing about the latest flare-up over Iraq is not how Saddam Hussein is behaving, but how our allies are behaving. Saddam is evil. But France, Russia and the U.N. -- they're scary.</p> <p>Saddam Hussein has absolutely no redeeming features. He has gone to war against five different countries: Israel, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. He tried to assassinate former President George Bush. He has murdered his closest relatives. He has used poison gas against Iran and the Kurds, and Scud missiles against Israeli cities. He is believed to be holding more than 600 Kuwaiti prisoners of war and refuses even to give the Red Cross their names. He invaded Kuwait to grab its oil wells and when forced to back down set Kuwait's oil fields ablaze, creating a monumental ecological disaster. He has never stood for election, he allows no freedom, he rules by terror. He has built a series of new palaces for himself since the gulf war, while Iraqi children suffer from malnutrition. He has done everything possible to evade U.N. inspections, in hopes of rebuilding his arsenal of nerve gas and germ weapons and to acquire a nuclear bomb.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>In a good many countries, an 846-page historical tome about the crimes of Communism would head straight for university libraries. In France, ''The Black Book of Communism,'' as it is called, has gone to the top of the nonfiction best-seller list, with sales fueled by heated debate in Parliament and the news media and by squabbling among its authors over how its material should be interpreted.</p> <p>French interest in such a topic may at first seem puzzling. The book, written by six historians and three years in preparation, details how between 85 million and 100 million people came to die at the hands of Communist regimes in the Soviet Union, China, Cambodia and elsewhere. But France was not a victim of Communist crimes and the French Communist Party merits only passing mention.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics']	<p>Seeking to end an ethics scandal that is threatening economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin appointed a new Finance Minister today to replace the embattled Anatoly B. Chubais.</p> <p>Mr. Chubais, who had held that post along with his broader duties as First Deputy Prime Minister, was stripped of the Finance Ministry job earlier today. But he remains in charge of the economy.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Although Iraq has agreed to allow United Nations arms inspectors back to Baghdad, officials and diplomats here fear they will return as a weakened force, facing the same intransigence as in the past but possibly with less ability to uncover weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein has had three weeks to hide.</p> <p>Officials fear that their work could be compromised by any promises Russia may have made to Iraq that it would press for an early end to inspections, emboldening the Iraqis to become even more defiant and devious than before. And they are concerned that during the period since Oct. 29, when on-site inspections ended, the Iraqis may have hidden more evidence, destroyed monitoring equipment and perhaps assembled weapons or produced toxic substances and stored them away.</p>
['biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>With Iraq's agreement to let all United Nations weapons inspectors return, the immediate crisis appears to have ended without use of military force, and the United States is declaring a victory for a united Security Council and for diplomacy.</p> <p>American officials argue that Saddam Hussein had to back down and that they preserved the authority of the United Nations. They also insist that the United States gave Iraq nothing concrete in return -- at least for now.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council, in a unanimous vote, made good today on its intention to impose new sanctions on Iraq, including banning foreign travel by Iraqi officials who do not cooperate with a United Nations disarmament commission. But Iraqi officials immediately said they would defy the demands, raising new questions about what will happen next.</p> <p>The Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, said in a statement in New York that the resolution was ''unjust'' and would be ignored.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia and Iraq have drafted a proposal to end the standoff between the United States and Saddam Hussein, Russia's Foreign Minister said this evening.</p> <p>Yevgeny M. Primakov, the Foreign Minister, said the plan would allow the United Nations to carry out weapons inspections, presumably with Americans taking part. But he said the inspectors' open-ended search for chemical, nuclear and biological weapons should be brought to a speedy conclusion.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>As Bill Clinton continues to pretend that no concession has been made to Iraq, Saddam Hussein has arranged with Russia's Yevgeny Primakov to remove the element of surprise from the U.N. Special Commission's searches for long-concealed germ-warfare facilities.</p> <p>The key is in Primakov's statement, swallowed whole by Clinton officials, that he negotiated an agreement to make inspections ''more effective.'' In Orwellese, that means penetrating the U.N. team with Russian spies.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin gave Jiang Zemin a bear hug when they met on the steps of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing today, apparently eager to show the world that all is well between Russia and China. Mr. Jiang returned the embrace.</p> <p>When the two Presidents spoke at a news conference later in the day, they went out of their way to act like pals, coloring their announcement of a border agreement with some public sharing about the joys of grandfatherhood.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid']	<p>See the spectacle of Moscow selling its latest missile know-how to Iran's ayatollahs and championing the sordid cause of Iraq's Saddam, proudly bestriding the world stage by sticking Russia's thumb in America's eye.</p> <p>And then read this headline on the front page of The Times: ''Russia Is Seeking More Western Aid for Financial Ills; American Backing Asked.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>It is not yet clear how the Iraq crisis will end. But it's already clear what it has exposed -- the serious tensions just beneath the surface of the U.S.-Russia relationship. Last Friday night, I found myself in Moscow watching CNN report from the White House that some U.S. officials suspect that the Russians and Iraqis may have cooked up the whole Iraq crisis in order to help Baghdad escape from U.N. sanctions. Wow. That's a serious charge. We haven't heard that kind of conspiracy talk since Khrushchev was pounding his shoe at the U.N. But after meeting here with Russian officials and analysts I can report that such charges certainly reflect the prevailing mood of U.S.-Russian ties. The U.S.-Russia relationship has gone in the last seven years from a strategic partnership, to a pragmatic partnership, to a relationship of benign neglect, to a relationship heading for malign neglect. Is it time to break out the reruns of ''Seven Days in May'' and ''From Russia With Love''?</p> <p>Not yet, but several factors are combining to push Russo-American relations downhill. One is a global phenomenon: There is a growing backlash against America's overwhelming economic and military superiority. America's allies and enemies are increasingly united in resentment of the U.S. Do you know what Iran calls America today? Not ''the Great Satan.'' Iran calls America ''the Capital of Global Arrogance.'' Unfortunately, that's also what the French, the Malaysians, the Russians, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Germans call Washington behind its back.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Iraq has told Russia that it will allow the unconditional return of all United Nations weapons inspectors, including Americans, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said this morning after an extraordinary 2 A.M. meeting here of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>Iraqi officials told the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, that Baghdad will make an announcement of its reversal later today, she said.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Russia has detained and ordered the expulsion of an Iranian it accuses of trying to buy missile technology, the Russian Foreign Ministry said today.</p> <p>Iran's Ambassador to Moscow insisted that the 33-year-old Iranian was a student who had arrived in Russia with an ordinary visa.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Facing extraordinary pressure from Washington, a major Russian partner in a project to explore for natural gas in Iran today postponed a bond offering to raise up to $3 billion.</p> <p>The postponement has temporarily headed off a decision by the Clinton Administration about whether to impose sanctions on the companies involved.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In an apparent effort to loosen the stranglehold of the Russian oligarchy, President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed one of Russia's most powerful tycoons from high Government office today.</p> <p>The removal of Boris A. Berezovsky from his position as deputy secretary of the National Security Council was the most dramatic power play yet in a vicious, continuing battle between the bankers who financed Mr. Yeltsin's re-election and the team of economic reformers the President appointed after he won.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'books and literature', 'ethics']	<p>A roiling scandal over a hefty publishing advance taken by First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, Russia's most prominent reformer, deepened today when President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed one of Mr. Chubais's co-authors from his Kremlin job.</p> <p>The presidential press service tersely announced today that Aleksandr Kazakov, a former privatization chief and the President's deputy chief of staff, was dismissed with no public explanation. He is also the chairman of Gazprom, the state-owned gas monopoly. Mr. Kazakov, Mr. Chubais and three others were promised $90,000 each for their contributions to a history of privatization.</p>
['foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>Worried that the global economic turmoil could overwhelm its financial system, Russia is quietly seeking American support for an expanded program of Western assistance, government officials and private bankers said.</p> <p>The purpose of the aid would be to strengthen confidence in Russia's Central Bank, which has been using up its reserves in an anxious effort to prop up the ruble.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The three Presidents of the Central European countries that have been invited to join NATO are unlikely to make an appearance in the Senate committee rooms in Washington where the debate over expanding the alliance will heat up early next year.</p> <p>But in an ''if you were there'' exercise, Transitions magazine, a Prague-based monthly, asked the three leaders to imagine just such an encounter.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Clinton has issued new guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons, ordering the Pentagon to focus less on planning a prolonged nuclear fight with a superpower like Russia and more on focused attacks to deter smaller powers from using chemical or biological weapons, Administration officials said tonight.</p> <p>The new guidelines recognize the world's fundamental shift in power -- and the rapidly changing threats -- since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The guidelines replace those that were put in place in 1981 under President Reagan at the height of the cold war.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>Russia reached agreement today with the International Monetary Fund on a plan that would open the door for a quick infusion of $1.7 billion in Western loans.</p> <p>Under the accord, Russia made new promises to improve its collection of taxes and cut Government spending.</p>
['treaties', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Declaring a ''victory for humanity,'' leaders from around the world gathered here today to sign a comprehensive ban on the global production and use of the deadliest of land mines.</p> <p>The more than 120 nations that will sign the treaty also pledged resources and money to clear 100 million antipersonnel land mines, which kill or maim thousands of soldiers and civilians every year.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Sometimes you can tell a lot about a country by what's on the front pages of its newspapers. Sometimes you can tell even more by what's on the back. Here's what's back-page news in Russia: The pilots of a helicopter based in Yessentuki, in southern Russia, had not been paid for so many months that on Nov. 22 they flew their chopper to a secluded spot and hid it. They said they would only return it when they received their back pay. Or, how about this for back-page news? The employees of the Ministry of Atomic Energy -- the folks responsible for maintaining Russia's nuclear warheads -- haven't been paid in 10 weeks. Ho hum. Dog bites man.</p> <p>Discovering what is back-page news in Russia helps one better understand (although not accept) why Russia responds differently than America to the prospects of Iran or Iraq acquiring weapons of mass destruction. To put it simply: Russia is otherwise engaged. It's hard to worry about Iraq's weapons when your own nuclear employees are going unpaid and crews are hiding their helicopters. As The Washington Post Moscow correspondent David Hoffman remarked to me, ''Russia today is like a blender with the top off and the motor running.'' We want them to just flip a switch and stop everything from spewing out. But it's not so easy.</p>
['credit', 'international trade and world market', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Defying American pressure to end its business dealings with Iran, Russia's huge natural gas company, Gazprom, has canceled an agreement with the United States Export-Import Bank.</p> <p>The American agency had agreed to guarantee $750 million in financing so Gazprom could purchase American equipment and services. The loan guarantees have come under fire in Congress because of Gazprom's decision to explore for gas in Iran. The Clinton Administration has also been considering sanctions against Russia.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, told the United States and other NATO members here today that Russia remained opposed to the use of force to get Iraq to permit full international inspection of suspected storage sites for biological and chemical weapons stockpiles.</p> <p>On another matter, Mr. Primakov assured the allies that Russia would continue to contribute to the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia if the mission is extended beyond next June.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Seeking to allay growing doubts about his  health, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia made his first sustained public appearance today since he was admitted to a sanitarium last week with what the Kremlin described as a cold.</p> <p>''I caught a cold somewhere -- I'm a bit weak,'' the 66-year-old Mr. Yeltsin said in front of television cameras after casting his vote in municipal elections at a polling place set up in the sanitarium, where he has been recuperating since Wednesday. ''On the whole, I don't feel too well.''</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States today opened up a nuclear processing plant in Ohio to international weapons experts, complete with continuous videotaping and surprise inspections, in hope of inducing Russia to do the same.</p> <p>Four inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency arrived at the United States Enrichment Corporation, a recently privatized plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, to install tamper-evident seals and monitoring equipment. They are watching the dilution of uranium that had been enriched for military use, so it is unsuitable for bombs or submarine reactors, but can be turned into fuel for civilian power plants.</p>
['finances']	<p>When the General Assembly agreed last week on what percentage of the United Nations budget each of the organization's 185 members would pay over the next three years, most attention focused on one issue: How much to charge the United States?</p> <p>But if Washington -- which was unable to persuade the United Nations to lower its longstanding 25 percent assessment, as Congress has been demanding -- was the primary loser, there were some less publicized victories.</p>

['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>The United States Government has received concrete promises of action by the Russian Government to stop Russian companies and scientists from assisting Iran's ballistic missile program, senior American officials say.</p> <p>The issue of Russian scientific and technological help to Iran as it attempts to build a ballistic missile capable of hitting Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia itself is the single most contentious issue between Moscow and Washington, officials say.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>''You've got to be the dumbest lawyer in Eastern Europe,'' I needled Daniel Arbess when we met in 1991. The 30-year-old Canadian-born lawyer from the Wall Street firm White & Case was helping the reform Government of Czechoslovakia solicit bids from foreign investors interested in buying state-owned enterprises. ''Smart'' lawyers worked for the foreign investors who controlled the money, but Arbess harbored a more subtle agenda. By helping the Czech Government, he hoped to boost economic reform in the region as well as make money for himself and his law firm -- and the strategy worked. White & Case made a profitable niche for itself by taking the side of former Soviet-bloc countries as they completed their traverse to capitalism.</p> <p>Arbess has come a long way from his days as a young Harvard-educated lawyer in Prague. He now hobnobs with some of Russia's most powerful businessmen, like Boris Berezovsky, and has grown rich buying dysfunctional companies in former Communist countries and turning them into profitable businesses. That Arbess is making money is insignificant (except to him); his investments also serve a greater social purpose.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Angered by what he considers needless intensification of tension between Iraq and the United States, President Boris N. Yeltsin today dispatched a special envoy to Baghdad with orders to end the mounting crisis over weapons inspections.</p> <p>It will not be an easy task, but officials in the Kremlin today said they were increasingly worried that President Clinton -- enmeshed in a deepening scandal at home -- will attempt to assert his leadership abroad with a rapid military strike on Iraq.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia and the United States displayed their sharp disagreements over Iraq today, with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright expressing deep skepticism that diplomatic solutions were possible and the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, saying that the negotiating process had just begun.</p> <p>Combined with a call by China at the United Nations today for a peaceful solution to the Iraq problem, Russia's stand was a setback to Ms. Albright's efforts. On her tour of Europe and the Middle East, she has been trying to create a sense of urgency and to convince the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, to capitulate quickly to United Nations demands for unconditional weapons inspections or face an intensive American and British bombing campaign.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Two decades of experience have taught the citizens of Baghdad a simple military lesson: when bombs are aimed at military targets in this city, civilians die.</p> <p>Although the Clinton Administration has so far talked only in general terms about military action against Iraq, the assumption here is that attacks will come by air and will be aimed at the elite Republican Guard that protects President Saddam Hussein and perhaps at the separate and pervasive security and intelligence services.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Clinton sought to intensify pressure on Iraq today, dispatching senior officials to consult with American allies in Europe and the Middle East and warning President Saddam Hussein, in the State of the Union address, that his defiance of the United Nations cannot continue.</p> <p>In his speech tonight to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Clinton cautioned the Iraqi President: ''You cannot defy the will of the world.'' Mr. Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction before, Mr. Clinton noted, and said, ''We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.''</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Who should get credit for the fact that the Federal budget is now virtually balanced?</p> <p>Economists and budget experts trying to answer that question have offered some predictable and some unusual suggestions as they celebrate the possible demise of the deficit.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In remarks that seemed to astonish everyone but the man who delivered them, President Boris N. Yeltsin warned today that the United States activities in Iraq could lead to a world war.</p> <p>''One must be careful in a world that is saturated with all kinds of weapons,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in televised remarks during a meeting in the Kremlin. ''By his actions Clinton might get into a world war. They are acting too loudly. Too loudly.''</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The most troubling statement in Boris Yeltsin's career was made this week to his chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais. The Russian President was provoked by a White House comment that the U.S. response to any use by Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction would be ''devastating.''</p> <p>Yeltsin took this to mean that the use of germ warfare by Saddam against the U.S. or its allies could well be met by nuclear war from the Americans. It is in our interest that such an assumption be made, thereby deterring any dictator anywhere from launching bacteriological war.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Clinton Administration's assertion that it has the right to attack Iraq to force Saddam Hussein to open sites to weapons inspectors is based on a succession of Security Council resolutions and statements and on the United Nations Charter itself.</p> <p>But officials have been reluctant to discuss specifics. ''Depending upon the factual situation, there could be various legal justifications under international law for military action against Iraq,'' James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said last week.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Clinton said today that Iraq had agreed to allow United Nations weapons inspectors immediate and unconditional access throughout the country, and he began to seek British, French and Russian support for a Security Council resolution that would warn Saddam Hussein of serious consequences if the deal is violated.</p> <p>In a news conference today, Mr. Clinton indicated that the agreement, reached by Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Hussein, would restore free and unfettered inspections by the United Nations Special Commission, known by its acronym, Unscom.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Secretary General Kofi Annan announced tonight that he is traveling to Iraq to try to resolve the crisis that has developed over President Saddam Hussein's refusal to open his country to unconditional inspection for proscribed weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Mr. Annan said he will leave on Thursday and hold discussions with Iraqi officials this weekend. An advance team from his office was dispatched tonight.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>United Nations weapons inspectors have found evidence that Russia held discussions with Iraq about selling Baghdad equipment that could be used to develop biological weapons, an official familiar with Iraqi weapons programs said today.</p> <p>But the official cautioned that it was not clear that any equipment had actually been delivered.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>In a special Government meeting that was half encounter group and half stagey show trial, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out at his Government for failing to correct the country's ailing economy and threatened a Cabinet shake-up.</p> <p>''We are going to sum up 1997 by naming specific culprits,'' Mr. Yeltsin warned sternly in a televised speech today. ''By the end of the session we may be short of three Government members.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Kremlin, trying yet again to assert itself in one of the last places where its diplomatic power remains undiminished, announced with great fanfare tonight that it had cobbled together a deal to stave off an American air strike against Iraq.</p> <p>No sooner had the Kremlin spoken than the Iraqi Government, in a statement read to reporters in Baghdad, denied that any such agreement had been reached between President Saddam Hussein and the Russian envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posvalyuk.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>With France, Russia and the Arab League engaging in intense consultations to find a compromise that would avert an American military strike on Iraq, Secretary General Kofi Annan today canceled a long-planned trip to the Middle East in order to remain at United Nations headquarters and help work toward a peaceful solution of the Iraq crisis.</p> <p>Russia, France and the Arab League, which oppose using military force, are struggling to find a formula acceptable to Iraq as well as to the Security Council, diplomats report. The Russians said Iraq had shifted from its blanket refusal to give United Nations weapons inspectors unrestricted access to eight sites suspected of concealing materials used to make biological and chemical weapons, and has offered proposals that fall short of full disclosure.</p>
['public opinion', 'foreign investments', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Seven years ago, the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, begrudgingly blessed the American-led campaign to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait.</p> <p>But now President Boris N. Yeltsin and his top aides have led the opposition to American military action against Iraq.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Standing side by side, President Clinton and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, issued a stern new warning today to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he will face substantial military action unless he complies with United Nations weapons inspectors and Security Council resolutions.</p> <p>''If Saddam does not comply with the unanimous will of the international community, we must be prepared to act, and we are,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Whether there is a diplomatic solution or not is entirely up to Saddam Hussein.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States and Britain may be on solid enough legal ground to justify a massive bombing raid of Iraq if United Nations weapons inspectors are denied access to its installations.</p> <p>Even if the two countries do not receive new authority from the Security Council, existing resolutions appear to give ample cover and have already been invoked in other military actions against Iraq since the Persian Gulf war.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia's Defense Minister, Igor Sergeyev, sharply criticized the United States today for threatening to attack Iraq, warning Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen that a strike could undercut efforts to improve military ties between Moscow and Washington.</p> <p>Speaking bluntly at the beginning of a meeting on arms control and other security issues, Mr. Sergeyev said Russia felt ''deep concern'' about the prospect of an American-led attack and accused the Clinton Administration of movingly hastily toward confrontation.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States failed to obtain backing today for new sanctions to punish Yugoslavia for its violent crackdown in Kosovo Province, but Washington did receive a promise from Moscow that Russia would support a United Nations resolution for a comprehensive arms embargo on the Government of President Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>Before the meeting here of the so-called Contact Group, which monitors events in Yugoslavia and the nations that broke away from it,  American officials had suggested  that they wanted the group's six members -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Italy and Germany -- to immediately impose new sanctions on the Yugoslav Government. But further sanctions were postponed for now, according to a statement released after the meeting.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>In a rebuff to the United States, Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry said today that it plans to sell several more nuclear reactors to Iran.</p> <p>The disclosure came as the United States signed an agreement in Kiev under which Ukraine would withdraw from the Russian program to build a reactor at Bushire, Iran.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia said today that his country's foreign policy would remain unchanged despite this week's political turmoil in Moscow.</p> <p>Russian foreign policy ''will not be affected by changes in the Government,'' he said at a news conference here with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>The Kremlin was calm and quite businesslike today as President Boris N. Yeltsin set about showing that his Government could press on even though he had dismissed his entire Cabinet on Monday.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, perhaps still pumped up from Monday's orgy of political beheadings, sternly warned a meeting of presidential aides that bureaucrats should be made to feel that any failure to enforce his decrees would be ''like death.''</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would not run for re-election in 2000, throwing the door open to a bevy of would-be successors.</p> <p>Since he dismissed his Cabinet last week, there has been speculation that Mr. Yeltsin was laying the groundwork for a third term by ridding the Government of his heir apparent: Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.</p>
['social conditions and trends']	<p>Russia is in search of a ''national idea'' that can define its essence and inspire its citizens. But so far the struggle for a post-Soviet identity has been a grandiose exercise in conflict and confusion.</p> <p>Russia's new national anthem has no words because nobody can agree on what it should say. Politicians are still squabbling over its tricolor flag.  A Government commission expressly set up last summer to develop a ''national idea'' came up empty-handed.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States is offering Russia an opportunity to expand its lucrative business launching foreign satellites if it clamps down on the sale of missile technology to Iran, senior American officials say.</p> <p>The American position has been conveyed confidentially to the Russians and is part of a broad effort to discourage Russian companies and institutes from helping Iran develop a new surface-to-surface missile.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's powerful Atomic Energy Minister was abruptly relieved of his duties today in a move that startled Russian and Western experts.</p> <p>A pugnacious official who spent much of his career developing Soviet nuclear weapons, Viktor N. Mikhailov has been one of the most influential figures in Russia's military and civilian nuclear establishment.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Security Council tonight unanimously endorsed Secretary General Kofi Annan's agreement with Iraq on weapons inspections, but without authorizing an automatic military response if Baghdad fails to comply.</p> <p>A majority of Security Council members -- led by China, France and Russia -- rebuffed the United States by holding out against any explicit threat, particularly wording that would appear to give a green light to an American attack in the event Iraq violates the agreement.</p>
['finances', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and its Western allies decided today to impose modest diplomatic and economic sanctions on Yugoslavia for President Slobodan Milosevic's ''unacceptable use of force'' against the ethnic Albanian majority in the province of Kosovo.</p> <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who had been seeking immediate and firm action against Mr. Milosevic, said today's decision was ''satisfactory.'' It was made in a four-hour emergency meeting of the so-called contact group that monitors Yugoslavia and the four neighboring republics that seceded from it.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Secretary General Kofi Annan forged another direct link with Iraq today by unveiling procedures for Iraqi presidential sites to be inspected under the watchful eyes of diplomats. He also sent a new commissioner to Baghdad tonight to oversee the operation.</p> <p>The inspections, which could begin in two weeks, are the latest in a series of steps taken by Mr. Annan,  deferring to Iraqi concerns about weapons inspections and allowing  Baghdad to bypass the Security Council. Within the last two weeks, Iraqis have effectively moved from near-pariah status to regular and direct contact with the highest ranking United Nations officials.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia said today that his Government would push to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty in order to prepare the way for President Clinton to visit Moscow for a summit meeting by the middle of the year.</p> <p>The Clinton Administration has quietly made a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin conditional on Russian passage of Start II, senior Administration officials say. Start II would cut each side's existing levels of warheads by two-thirds.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>When one of Russia's most ardent reformers set out to convert the state-run pension system into a program of private individual retirement accounts, he never imagined that the unabashedly capitalist idea would be rebuffed by the World Bank.</p> <p>The idea was to give Russians more control over their financial future and encourage economic growth. The billions of rubles deposited in the accounts would find their way into investments at home.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The B-61-11, the latest addition to America's nuclear arsenal, is known as an earth penetrator. The new nose and steel casings add weight and strength, and the fuse has been changed to delay detonation until seconds after impact. The result is a bomb that burrows several feet before exploding, enabling it to obliterate targets like command bunkers and chemical-weapons factories several hundred feet beneath the surface. All in all, it represents a significant leap in bomb design, and that's precisely the problem. Pentagon officials deny that the B-61-11 is a new weapon.</p> <p>This is because the ''physics package'' -- the primary fission reaction and the secondary fusion reaction that power the explosion -- is the same as in the B-61-7 (which offers ''dial a yield,'' literally a dial on the casing that adjusts the payload from 10 kilotons up to 340 kilotons, a kiloton being equal to 1,000 tons of TNT). But if you define a weapon by its military application, this one is new; the Pentagon did not previously have an earth penetrator.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's recently dismissed Prime Minister announced today that he would run for President in 2000, adding a new twist to a week of political back-stabbing and backroom maneuvering.</p> <p>The former Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was ousted on Monday when President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his Cabinet. But Mr. Chernomyrdin fought back today, portraying himself today as a presidential candidate.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, may have made just enough concessions over the conflict in Kosovo Province to confound Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's efforts to intensify Western sanctions against him, American and European officials said today.</p> <p>Ms. Albright heads off to Europe on Monday evening to try to increase the pressure on Mr. Milosevic to open a serious discussion about political autonomy with the ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population of the province, which is in southern Serbia.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>Even before he was appointed Russia's Minister for Atomic Energy today, Yevgeny Adamov had caught Washington's attention.</p> <p>Mr. Adamov, 58, a nuclear engineer, went to Teheran last month with Viktor N. Mikhailov, the minister who was ousted Monday, to meet with Iranian officials.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Demonstrating once again his enormous power and his mercurial nature, President Boris N. Yeltsin astonished the nation today by dismissing his entire Cabinet, including his loyal and dedicated aide, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.</p> <p>Even for people who have grown used to Mr. Yeltsin's almost Shakespearean penchant for casting off those closest to him at regular intervals, today's actions seemed difficult to comprehend.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>MARK GAINS.  The mark rallied to end higher after traders concluded that a Cabinet shake-up in Russia could help economic relations with Germany. The dollar cost 1.8256 marks in New York, down from 1.8302 Friday.</p>
['banks and banking', 'finances', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Ever since President Boris N. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996, the battle for Russia has been portrayed as a bitter struggle between a small group of tycoons who bankrolled his campaign in exchange for insider privileges, and the band of economic reformers he appointed to rein in those powerful bankers and businessmen.</p> <p>No political decision is made in Russia without setting off an explosion of conspiracy theories. When Mr. Yeltsin dismissed his entire Cabinet today, including his loyal Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the question was not just why, but who was really behind the decision.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin did not call. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin did not call. No top American officials in Washington heard from their Russian counterparts today.</p> <p>In spite of the silence, United States officials, expressing some surprise but no shock at Mr. Yeltsin's sudden sacking of his Cabinet, said over and over that relations with Moscow remained utterly unchanged by the upheaval.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>The shadowy battle over the future of the Russian Government has burst into the open as a struggle that is less about ideology, Boris Yeltsin's health or even the qualifications of his choice for Prime Minister than about who will control economic policy.</p> <p>After weeks of bitter infighting, the terms of the battle were laid out openly today in a newspaper controlled by one of the country's most powerful tycoons. The newspaper outlined conditions for a resolution of the fight over President Yeltsin's Cabinet that would undermine the nation's most prominent market reformers.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Aleksandr I. Lebed stood in the Siberian chill in nothing more than a dark business suit and told the voters his iron hand could turn their region around.</p> <p>The overflow crowd in the auditorium was bundled up in bulky coats and fur hats. Siberia may be rich in natural resources, but Achinsk is too strapped to pay its heating bills.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Bronislaw Geremek, the Foreign Minister of Poland, is an ineffably polite man and a practiced listener. But there are occasions that try his patience.</p> <p>After hearing some platitudes over a copious lunch from his counterpart in neighboring Belarus about how the authoritarian Government there held no political prisoners, Mr. Geremek, a dissident during Poland's Communist era, replied crisply, ''That's what they used to say in Poland when I was in prison and being called a hooligan who spied for the United States.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents in Russia's fractious legislature abruptly abandoned their posture of defiance today and approved his choice for Prime Minister, avoiding parliamentary elections that could have cost many of them their jobs.</p> <p>After weeks of strident threats and sullen rebellion, the lower house voted 251 to 25 to confirm Sergei Kiriyenko, a 35-year-old plucked from relative obscurity, as Prime Minister. The rest of the 450 deputies refused to vote.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>A truck laden with 22 tons of stainless steel that could be used to make missiles has been intercepted on its way to Teheran, raising new questions about Russia's determination to end assistance to Iran's missile program.</p> <p>American officials warned the Russian authorities several days in advance that a shipment of steel, which they said was a special alloy particularly suited for use in making fuel tanks for Scud missiles, was expected to leave Moscow, based on United States intelligence reports.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>A standoff between the United States and Russia has apparently derailed plans for a Security Council debate early next week about changing the level of nuclear inspections in Iraq,  diplomats said today.</p> <p>The Security Council meets on Monday to review sanctions on Iraq, imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, following renewed Iraqi demands that the embargo be ended and weapons inspections restricted. The sanctions are expected to be renewed for another six months.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States and Britain have begun a secretive operation to remove nuclear material from the volatile Caucasus nation of Georgia, Western officials say.</p> <p>The supply of highly enriched uranium and spent nuclear fuel is stored at a research reactor outside the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. It has been a serious concern for American officials, who feared it could fall into the hands of Chechen gangs, Iran or another aspiring nuclear power.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Ben & Jerry's is against expanding NATO.  So is Phyllis Schlafly, the arch-conservative activist. So is Sam Nunn, the retired Georgia Democrat who was the Senate's most authoritative voice on national security matters.</p> <p>From left, right and center -- and all points in between on the political compass -- an unlikely coalition of arms-control advocates, business leaders, United Nations-bashers and foreign-policy experts have launched a grass-roots campaign to derail the addition of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to the military alliance.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'treaties', 'war and revolution']	<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto began a two-day meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today in an effort to improve economic cooperation and work toward a peace treaty that would finally mark an end to territorial disputes dating from World War II.</p> <p>Both men appeared vigorous and cheerful as they greeted each other with an embrace in the resort town of Kawana, 80 miles southwest of Tokyo.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'news and news media', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Since winning the race for Mayor last month, Andrei Klimentyev has had some trouble meeting with his constituents.</p> <p>No sooner was his victory announced than the election was annulled and the would-be mayor dragged to jail to face corruption charges. Instead of moving into City Hall, Mr. Klimentyev has been spending his days in a cage in a municipal courtroom, his legal papers stuffed inside a plastic bag.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States has been working quietly with other nations to defuse a growing confrontation between Russia and Latvia that threatens to damage Washington's already fraying relationship with Moscow.</p> <p>The Latvian Cabinet today agreed on important changes in its citizenship laws to answer Russian contentions that Latvia mistreats Russians who live there, senior American officials said. The legislation, which is subject to approval by Parliament, would grant citizenship to all children born in Latvia after Aug. 21, 1991, and would make it easier for Russian-speakers to become naturalized.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>To hear Yuri I. Chunkov tell it, he and other Communists in the Russian Parliament have no choice but to vote down President Boris N. Yeltsin's nominee for prime minister on Friday, even if that vote ends up costing them their seats.</p> <p>''Disbanding the Parliament is not a pleasant option, of course, but we can't let this situation continue,'' said the former economics professor, whose ears are still ringing from the complaints heard last weekend from his constituents in the depressed coal-mining region of Kemerovo. ''The cauldron is at the boiling point, people are in a fury.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia's deteriorating control of its nuclear weapons is increasing the danger of an accidental or unauthorized attack on the United States, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning group warned today.</p> <p>A dozen missiles fired from a Russian nuclear submarine would kill nearly seven million Americans instantly, and millions more would die from radiation, according to a study conducted under the auspices of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which won the Nobel Peace Prize for its work on nuclear weapons in 1985. The study is to be published tomorrow in The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Seeking to bring an end to the violence in Kosovo, the United States and five of its allies imposed new economic sanctions on Yugoslavia today. They threatened further action if the Yugoslavs do not agree to hold negotiations with the province's ethnic Albanian separatists.</p> <p>Calling the current situation in Kosovo ''untenable,'' the so-called contact group, which monitors events in Yugoslavia and the republics that broke away from it, also offered to reward Yugoslavia with membership in international economic organizations if it took steps toward a peaceful settlement with the leadership of the province.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Tomorrow's showdown in Moscow between President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament is shaping up to be not only a crisis in Russian politics, but also a profound threat to Russian democracy.</p> <p>On the surface, the issue is straightforward. Having dismissed the entire Government, Mr. Yeltsin nominated Sergei Kiriyenko as his new Prime Minister. In the first and second votes by the Parliament, Mr. Kiriyenko failed to win a majority. If the Duma rejects him for a third time on Friday, a 50-50 bet according to savvy Muscovites, Mr. Yeltsin will dissolve the Parliament and call new elections, as the Constitution allows.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Russia plans to deliver advanced antiaircraft missiles to the Greek Cypriot Government in August, despite American protests that the sale will inflame tensions on the island, part of which is Turkish-controlled.</p> <p>The United States has repeatedly sought to block the sale of the S-300 system, as the missiles are known, and Turkey has even warned that it may take military action. But today the head of the Russian arms sales company Rosvooruzheniye, Yevgeny Ananyev, said Russia was determined to ship the weapons.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Pakistan's test of a new missile with a range exceeding 900 miles, a weapon able to strike Bombay or New Delhi with a nuclear warhead, was based on technology smuggled from North Korea, United States Government officials and private analysts said today.</p> <p>The new liquid-fueled missile, called the Ghauri, is an enhanced version of the North Korean Rodong missile, which is itself a fancy version of the Scud missile developed in Moscow in the 1960's, they said.</p>
['elections']	<p>Aleksandr I. Lebed, the outspoken former general, enhanced his presidential hopes today by winning a place in the runoff election for governor of a vast Russian region.</p> <p>The race for governor is by Mr. Lebed's own admission a make-or-break political test. He is planning to use the region, Krasnoyarsk, as a springboard for the presidential race in the year 2000 if he wins. He risks political oblivion if he loses.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia is helping India to build a sea-launched ballistic missile that can carry a nuclear warhead and strike deep into Pakistan, say senior Clinton Administration officials, who fear the program will inflame simmering tensions in South Asia.</p> <p>The assistance has continued for at least three years, the officials said, despite assurances from Russia that its scientists are not contributing restricted technology to India's missile programs.</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'biographical information']	<p>Dan Pollard, a Baptist missionary from Oregon, settled his wife and teen-age daughters in Vanino, a remote town in eastern Russia, four years ago, built a congregation of local families and a church of local timber.</p> <p>Now Mr. Pollard and his family have become the first American missionaries reported to be evicted from Russia since the passage of a law last fall that restricts the rights of minority churches and religions and protects the Russian Orthodox Church from competition.</p>
['elections']	<p>As Russia's three-week-old political crisis neared a showdown, President Boris N. Yeltsin left tonight for a two-day visit to Japan, leaving the Government in the hands of a 35-year-old Prime Minister-designate who today was dealt his second defeat in Parliament's lower house.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's choice, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, who served briefly as Energy Minister before becoming Mr. Yeltsin's candidate to head a new Government, was rejected for a second time today, 271 to 115, a defeat that was even more lopsided than the first one a week ago.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'biographical information']	<p>As workers took to the streets this week to demonstrate against the Government's chronic inability to pay back wages, a young Kremlin official huddled with labor leaders to defuse the protest.</p> <p>Even though Moscow has repeatedly failed to make good on its promises to pay the wages, the labor leaders agreed to give it yet another chance. ''Kiriyenko has given us hope,'' said Aleksei Surikov, the deputy head of the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>A black American marine has been severely beaten by a band of Russian skinheads in a new wave of assaults against foreigners of African and Asian descent.</p> <p>The attack occurred in daylight on Saturday at Fili Park, a busy area where Russians often buy compact disks, according to Western officials.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia called on Indonesia's leader today to show restraint in responding to the country's growing unrest, and said a solution would have to involve political as well as economic changes.</p> <p>President Clinton said President Suharto should ''open a dialogue with all elements of the society'' in an attempt to create ''a genuine sense of political reform and reconciliation'' while continuing to overhaul Indonesia's economy.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Senate voted nearly unanimously today to punish foreign enterprises or institutions -- especially those in Russia -- that provide sensitive missile technology or expertise to Iran.</p> <p>The overwhelming vote, 90 to 4, reflects the Senate's growing alarm at Iran's drive to build long-range rockets that could threaten American troops and allies in the Mideast, and frustration with Moscow for failing to curb missile know-how to Iran.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In reactions that followed the relatively mild pattern of responses to nuclear tests conducted by India two weeks ago, Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia joined the United States today in taking action against Pakistan for going ahead with tests of its own.</p> <p>Other Pakistani trading partners, like France and Russia, expressed ''disappointment'' and ''concern'' at word of the tests but stopped short of recommending any sanctions.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'stocks and bonds', 'currency']	<p>Just when it began to look as if Latin America had dodged the bullet of Asia's financial and economic woes, stock markets from Mexico to Chile began to tumble. The decline, which began in earnest three weeks ago, accelerated earlier this week, ushering in a period of increased volatility, stock market analysts said.</p> <p>Stock trackers are taking note of everything from low commodity prices causing trade imbalances in Venezuela and Chile, to political uncertainty in Argentina, to fears over currency stability in Brazil, to an embarrassing money-laundering bank scandal in Mexico, stormy weather in Peru and disappointing company earnings throughout the region.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Dan Pollard, an American missionary who was evicted from Russia in March under a new law that restricts minority religious groups, has been granted a visa for three months to return to his church in Vanino, a remote port town in the Far East. He received the visa on Thursday from the Russian Consulate in Seattle, and plans to leave for Russia today.</p> <p>The religion law passed last year in Russia requires that every religious group or faith that has not been active in Russia for 15 years must be certified by the Government in order to practice freely.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The traditional May Day holiday might seem to be the sort of occasion that would mobilize Russian opinion against NATO's decision to take in three of Moscow's former satellites.</p> <p>But the United States Senate's vote to approve NATO expansion drew a collective yawn today. The big stories on the evening news were a surge in fighting in Tajikistan, the kidnapping of President Boris N. Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya and the formation of the new Government.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Aleksandr I. Lebed, the former paratroop general whose political ambitions are a cause of worry for President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Communist opposition, won a sweeping victory tonight in a runoff gubernatorial election in the Siberian region of Krasnoyarsk, assuring himself of a foothold in Russia's presidential race in 2000.</p> <p>With 95 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Lebed, 48, was ahead by almost 19 percent, with 57 percent of the vote. It was a convincing comeback for a man who was bounced from his job as chief of Russia's Security Council two years ago and who was sent by the Kremlin into political exile.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>President Clinton urged President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today to press for the ratification of a pending nuclear weapons treaty even as the United States and its allies searched for ways to head off a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan.</p> <p>On his final day of meetings here with the leaders of the six other major industrial democracies and Russia, Mr. Clinton drew a link between American efforts to continue reducing the stores of nuclear weapons held by the former cold war antagonists and attempts to halt the spread of nuclear ability to other nations.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>It was a month in the making, but President Boris N. Yeltsin has assembled a new team that is strikingly young, pro-reform and from outside Moscow.</p> <p>The Russian political establishment was stunned when Mr. Yeltsin selected the 35-year-old Sergei V. Kiriyenko last month as his new Prime Minister. After a drawn-out effort to win confirmation for Mr. Kiriyenko from Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin went further by filling out the top ranks of his Government with a squad of young politicians cut from the same cloth.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'stocks and bonds', 'television', 'news and news media', 'finances']	<p>With a crash on financial markets, floods in Siberia and a miners' protest that blocked the country's main railroad, Russia has had a lot of bad news lately. Too much, according to President Boris N. Yeltsin, who called in the directors of three national television channels this week to complain about negative coverage.</p> <p>Armed with reports documenting the impact of news broadcasts on the miners' weeklong sit-in on the Trans-Siberian railroad, Mr. Yeltsin said he was not trying to dictate how Russia's media should cover events.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>As President Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia was flying home last Sunday from a visit to Turkey, his pilot gave him alarming news. The two Georgian Air Force jets that normally escort the President's plane to guard him against airborne attack were nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Mr. Shevardnadze's plane landed safely in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, and after an urgent inquiry it turned out that the jets were parked at a nearby Russian base and could not fly because sand had been poured into their engines. Mr. Shevardnadze was outraged and immediately dismissed the Defense Minister, Lieut. Gen. Vardiko Nadibaidze, who is known for his pro-Russian stance.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The Clinton Administration offered no objections in the Security Council today when a travel ban on Iraqi officials was ended, but the United States and Russia are still at an impasse over when and how to respond to a report last month that in effect declared Iraq free of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The travel ban had never actually been imposed, and American officials said the step was not significant. But the Administration fought hard and long last fall to win Security Council backing for the measure, which would have restricted international travel for top Iraqis responsible for a lack of cooperation with the arms inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>As Russia's financial markets teetered on the brink of collapse, Moscow mounted a drastic effort today to preserve the value of its currency and stem the exodus of foreign investors.</p> <p>In a quick series of steps to address the new Russian Government's most serious economic crisis, officials tripled interest rates, announced that they would be willing to accept a far lower price for the sell-off of Russia's last big oil company, and appealed for support from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>The most famous author in Russia is not a novelist or a poet. He is the former head of Russia's privatization agency whose main preoccupation these days is simply staying out of jail.</p> <p>For months, Alfred Kokh has been defending himself against allegations that a lucrative book advance he received was merely a thinly disguised payoff from one of Russia's richest business tycoons.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The main Western industrial nations imposed an investment ban on Serbia today and froze its assets abroad as their concern grew about the violence in Kosovo, a southern Serbian province. They also froze the overseas assets of Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro.</p> <p>Foreign and Finance Ministers of the Group of Eight countries, meeting here as part of the summit meeting in Birmingham next week, called for urgent discussions between Belgrade and the Albanian leadership in  Kosovo, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population.</p>
['news and news media', 'elections']	<p>This city in southern Siberia has become the center ring of Russian politics in the last several weeks -- a place where movie stars, pop singers, image makers and dirty-tricks artists have been busily parading their campaign skills.</p> <p>Like everyone else in the vast region that stretches north to the Arctic circle, Vladimir N. Rube, editor of the daily newspaper The Evening Krasnoyarsk, has been consumed by the drama of the campaign between the incumbent, Valery Zubov, who is the Kremlin's candidate, and Aleksandr Lebed, the former paratroop general and ousted Kremlin aide. Mr. Lebed's probable victory will give him a good shot at the Russian presidency in 2000.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'medicine and health', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>As troubles continue to rain down on Russia's new Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin, himself now facing the latest in a series of impeachment votes, tried today to reassure jittery investors that the country would not shift off its ''balanced, finely tuned course.''</p> <p>The week began with a sharp drop on Russia's financial markets, where prices fell 12 percent Monday. On Tuesday, the market steadied after the Central Bank spent more than $500 million to protect the ruble and raised refinancing rates to 50 percent from 30, an increase that will bite into Russia's already overextended budget.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia today resisted the call to take tough action against India because of the underground nuclear tests.</p> <p>The Government condemned India's decision to conduct the tests. But it also opposed the use of economic sanctions and said President Boris N. Yeltsin would go ahead with a planned visit to India this year.</p>
['computers and the internet']	<p>''Good day, citizens of the Internet,'' the salutation began. ''This is my first live Internet experience.''</p> <p>Russians are beginning to discover the Internet. But Moscow has never seen anything like President Boris N. Yeltsin's on-line chat today on the Web site maintained by MSNBC.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Political turmoil in Indonesia, the collapse of many economies in Asia and the threatened economic sanctions on India all sent a key commodity index to its lowest level in more than four years yesterday.</p> <p>At the same time, the recent slump in the Russian stock market and the continued disruption of supplies from Russia sent the spot price of palladium over $400 an ounce -- and above the price of its sister metal, platinum, for the first time. Although the rally fizzled later in the day, palladium remains near an all-time high and could move higher.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>Trying to resolve two of the toughest disputes between the United States and Europe, the Clinton Administration  waived sanctions today against three foreign companies that are doing business in Iran and said that it would seek legislation to head off sanctions against businesses that operate in Cuba.</p> <p>In exchange the European Union and Russia agreed to tighten control of the export of weapons technology to Iran. The European Union also agreed with the United States to set up a system to govern confiscated property in Cuba and elsewhere.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States and Russia have reached a broad agreement on how to proceed with future nuclear-arms inspections of Iraq now that the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared itself ready to move out of an active disarmament phase and into long-term monitoring.</p> <p>A formal statement by the Security Council is expected this week, though diplomats are hard pressed to explain why it is being further delayed, since Council members are finally in accord and are preparing to ask the nuclear agency to present its plans for a change in monitoring.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia today reaffirmed its refusal to join other countries in punishing India for resuming nuclear tests, and has so far failed to register an especially strong diplomatic protest.</p> <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin still plans to visit India later this year. And some top officials at Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy want to go ahead with plans to sell India two nuclear power plants.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>Shaken by global financial turmoil, Russia tried to assure anxious investors today that it would not follow the path of Indonesia and other faltering Asian economies.</p> <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin summoned leading bankers and industrialists to an unusual Kremlin meeting this week on ways to end the financial crisis.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>This just in from the Pentagon: Cuba is not, after all, much of a threat to national security.</p> <p>The Pentagon's intelligence report, like all matters Cuban, ignited controversy on Capitol Hill. Even before its release, Speaker Newt Gingrich protested to the Pentagon that Fidel Castro remained ''a dangerous and unstable tyrant.''</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>The Clinton policy for dealing with major dictatorships is now fully revealed in its magnificent simplicity -- speak softly, throw away sticks,  drop gracefully to one knee, present gifts and sing ''Oh, Promise Me.''</p> <p>For some years, the policy has been no secret to the dictators or those Americans who bother to pay attention. The results have been productive, no denying that.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Reinforcing the NATO alliance's threat of military action to stop the violence in Kosovo, the United States, Russia and six other major industrial democracies meeting here today demanded a halt to Serbian attacks on ethnic Albanian civilians in the province.</p> <p>Foreign ministers of the eight countries gave President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia until Tuesday to call off the offensive. He is expected to see President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, the country most hesitant to consent to the use of force against Serbia, in Moscow that day.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>As Congressional Republicans and human rights advocates deride President Clinton for visiting China, they might ask themselves the following question: since 1989, which system has improved the lives of its citizens more, China's one-party dictatorship or Russia's multiparty democracy?</p> <p>Whether the measure is personal freedom or economic gain, the answer is China's dictatorship. China's rulers have overseen the formation of a capitalist society, where wealth is created at the bottom by individual entrepreneurs. A middle class of tens of millions is beginning to emerge, and along with that, personal freedoms have expanded for homosexuals, unmarried couples, young parents and entrepreneurs.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'television', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'reform and reorganization', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, seeking to forestall a NATO military incursion in the Serbian province of Kosovo, promised today to undertake a personal diplomatic effort with the Serbian leadership in an effort to defuse the violence there.</p> <p>Speaking after a day of talks with  Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr. Yeltsin said NATO action would ''destabilize the situation in the Balkans with unforeseeable consequences for all of Europe.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'ethics']	<p>The Yeltsin Government began its long-overdue fight against tax evasion today by arresting the country's top statisticians and accusing them of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes.</p> <p>The head of the State Committee for Statistics, Yuri Yurkov, and his top deputies were arrested in raids on Monday night.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States and its allies said today that pledges by the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, did not go far enough to meet the demands of the West that he end his crackdown in Kosovo, and that planning for possible NATO military intervention was continuing.</p> <p>But Western officials also said that Mr. Milosevic's promises, made to the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in their meeting in Moscow today, were a first step toward halting the Serbian offensive against the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, the southernmost province of Serbia. They emphasized that the West would carefully monitor Serbian compliance with Mr. Milosevic's promises in the coming days.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia promised today to make concessions over Kosovo to forestall military action by the West. But he failed to meet one key demand: the withdrawal of Serbian security forces accused of attacking ethnic Albanians in the province.</p> <p>After a day of closed-door meetings here with President Boris N. Yeltsin and other top Russian officials, the Yugoslav leader announced his promises. They included access for relief groups and international monitors, arrangements for refugees to return and the resumption of talks with Kosovo's Albanians.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>Both the greatest opportunity and the greatest danger for the United States internationally may well still lie in Russia. If we do not soon seize the opportunity, the danger will increase -- and could present us with the most serious threat to basic global stability since the end of the cold war.</p> <p>The recent financial turmoil and labor unrest are signs of danger. The West's response -- yet another International Monetary Fund bailout -- shows that we are helping the reformers fight, and sometimes win, battles. But we are not winning the war. We may not even have a strategy, because we have not understood the extent and depth of either the material transformation or the spiritual demoralization of the Russian people since the fall of Communism.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances']	<p>There is nothing like a crisis to propel Boris N. Yeltsin into action, and the bottoming out of Russia's financial markets in recent weeks did the trick once again.</p> <p>Night after night, the 67-year-old President has been shown on television, filling the airwaves with proof of a crisis-packed schedule, meeting in turn with media chiefs, bankers and Government officials, threatening and cajoling each group with his familiar bluster.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>When messages filtering out of Russia reached the headquarters of German intelligence earlier this year, alarm bells began to sound throughout the upper reaches of the German Government. Russian intelligence sources had delivered shocking  news: the German official charged with rooting out spies was himself a Russian spy -- Moscow's leading  mole in Europe.</p> <p>The official, Volker Foertsch, was subjected to a prolonged investigation. His home was searched and a video camera placed in his office. Later he was put on annual leave.  After the investigation, German prosecutors concluded that they did not have enough evidence to charge him with espionage.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>By the time the first copies of Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn's latest book landed at a Moscow bookstore on Thursday, its arrival had been heralded far and wide. Excerpts were published in half a dozen newspapers, and there were announcements on radio and television -- just the kind of fanfare that might be expected for a work by the great Soviet dissident, Nobel Prize winner and tireless defender of Russia's battered soul.</p> <p>But for all the advance publicity, the publication of ''Russia in Collapse,'' a 204-page volume of apocalyptic musings about the fate of the nation, begs a question that has dogged its 79-year-old author since his return from exile four years ago: Who in Russia today is prepared to read what Mr. Solzhenitsyn has to say?</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's new national security adviser, the thoughtful academician Andrei Kokoshin, is in town to reassure the Clinton Administration it should not worry about Moscow's technology exports to Iran.</p> <p>At a breakfast with reporters, Boris Yeltsin's man was asked if Russia would stand with NATO in responding militarily to Slobodan Milosevic's bloody crackdown in Serbia's mainly Albanian province of Kosovo.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'currency', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>Fearing a meltdown of the Russian currency that could threaten the stability of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government, President Clinton said today that the United States would support new international financial aid if Russia is unable to meet its short-term debts.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton's statement, made after a tumultuous week in which investors fled the Russian ruble, appeared to pave the way for a new bailout of Russia by the International Monetary Fund. While American officials refused to talk about the size of any new program, or when it might begin, outside experts said Russia could need upward of $10 billion to make up for huge shortfalls in oil revenues and tax collections.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The United States, Russia, China, Britain and France called on India and Pakistan today to freeze their nuclear weapons development and agree not to test nuclear missiles or arm them with warheads.</p> <p>In return, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, all nuclear powers themselves, offered to help India and Pakistan reduce tensions over the disputed territory of Kashmir.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>More than 80 NATO warplanes lifted off from European bases this morning, coursing across the skies over the Adriatic Sea and Albania and Macedonia to reinforce NATO's demand that Serbia stop using military force against civilians in Kosovo.</p> <p>With conflict in Kosovo Province intensifying, along with the fear that it may spread, the West has threatened the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, with measures that could include air strikes unless he stops the attacks on separatist ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and enters serious negotiations with leaders there. Ninety percent of the 2 million Kosovars are Albanian.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a blunt dressing down, Russia's Defense Minister told the top United States military commander today that Moscow had been misled over the timing of NATO's air exercises in the Balkans.</p> <p>The criticism underscored the differences between Russia and the Western alliance on the eve of a critical meeting here between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President.</p>
['foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin summoned Russian legislators today to an unusual public meeting and demanded that they enact a rash of measures to restore the confidence of foreign investors.</p> <p>The extraordinary session was intended to impress the International Monetary Fund, which is beginning negotiations over billions of dollars in additional financing.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia has agreed to sell two nuclear power stations to India, defying calls to punish New Delhi because of its testing of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The head of the Atomic Energy Ministry here concluded the deal, worth $3 billion or more to Russia's cash-starved nuclear energy industry, on Sunday.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States, Russia and European countries monitoring fighting between ethnic Albanian and Serbian forces in Kosovo turned their attention to the rebels today, condemning outside support for the fighters and urging all countries to prevent exiles from financing arms for the insurgents.</p> <p>While the diplomats of the six countries, known as the contact group, acknowledge that the primary responsibility for the bloodshed in Kosovo lies with Serbia, their statement today was almost as critical of the insurgents. The diplomats also said for the first time that negotiations should include ethnic Albanian representatives.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances']	<p>Russia's faltering economy and plunging world oil prices prompted the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin today to postpone the sale of its state oil company.</p> <p>Russian officials said tonight that the auction of the company, Rosneft, would be delayed until September or October. It is the second time that the Government has put off the sale because of a lack of bids.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Seven weeks ago the chief of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, assured the world's financial markets that there was no reason to panic about Russia.</p> <p>''Contrary to what markets and commentators are imagining,'' Mr. Camdessus insisted as investors were fleeing the Russian markets, ''this is not a crisis. This is not a major development.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Here's Saturday's news quiz:</p> <p>1. Is there really any difference between Boris Yeltsin and Suharto or between Russia and Indonesia?</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Vice President Al Gore ended two days of talks here today by declaring his confidence that Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko will be able to carry out the fiscal reforms needed to make the Russian Government solvent.</p> <p>Mr. Gore's statements came after two days of get-acquainted meetings with Mr. Kiriyenko, who has replaced former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as the senior official on a panel that coordinates the two Governments' work on major Russian-American issues.</p> <p>At a news conference with Mr. Kiriyenko, Mr. Gore said his counterpart had ''full command'' of the economic issues ''and a very impressive understanding of economic reform and what must be done in order to advance reform.''</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>Wearing black ski masks, a phalanx of gun-toting Russian tax police swept into a dingy warehouse this week and confiscated thousands of shiny bottles of vodka complete with phony markings indicating that alcohol taxes had been paid.</p> <p>The tax-cheating owner managed to escape, but Boris G. Fyodorov said he was not discouraged.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Politicians began jockeying today for the chance to play chief surgeon to the world's second-largest economy after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, saying he was responsible for his party's disastrous finish in parliamentary elections on Sunday.</p> <p>Mr. Hashimoto's resignation left a political vacuum at the economic heart of Asia, sending stocks and currencies reeling across the continent today and touching off fears that another chapter could be beginning in the Asian financial crisis. [At midday on Tuesday, the yen was up slightly against the dollar and stock prices were mixed.]</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The White House today urged Japan's next Government to move quickly to ''restore confidence in Japan's financial system,'' even while Administration officials said they feared that political paralysis in Tokyo greatly complicated efforts to ignite a recovery in Asia and ease pressure on other countries, including Russia.</p> <p>White House officials today spent little time mourning the departure of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose slowness to act on economic reforms had been a continuing source of frustration here.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>The Russian Government and international lenders concluded an agreement today aimed at easing Russia's financial crisis and restoring confidence in its economy.</p> <p>The agreement would provide $17.1 billion in additional loans over the next two years. About $12.6 billion would be delivered this year and another $4.5 billion would be available in 1999. Combined with existing international assistance, the new pact would bring total lending to Russia to $22.6 billion over this year and next.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Iran's wrestling team walked out of its match against the United States twice last night, during a demonstration by a resistance movement seeking the removal of Iran's President, Mohammad Khatami.</p> <p>After delays of 20 minutes and 10 minutes, the United States (2-0) won the Goodwill Games competition at Madison Square Garden by 19-9. The Americans can assure themselves of a gold medal by beating Russia (2-0) in today's final match of the round-robin tournament.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton has agreed to travel to Russia in early September to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin, although the Russian legislature has not fulfilled a request to ratify an important arms control treaty signed with the United States, the White House announced today.</p> <p>The two Presidents have made a practice of annual summit meetings, but for more than a year the White House had postponed responding to Mr. Yeltsin's invitation to Russia.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Clinton Administration said today that it would impose trade sanctions on nine Russian companies and institutions that have been helping Iran with its missile program.</p> <p>The Administration's action comes as the Russian Government, for the first time, publicly announced an investigation into the nine enterprises for violating new export control laws worked out in cooperation with the United States.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'elections']	<p>Rogue nations could develop and deploy ballistic missiles for an attack against the United States with ''little or no warning,'' an independent commission announced today.</p> <p>But senior American intelligence officials today stood by their longstanding estimate that no country besides Russia and China, which already have ballistic missiles, could field long-range rockets before 2010, with the possible exception of North Korea.</p> <p>The unanimous conclusions of the bipartisan commission, headed by former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, provide fresh ammunition for supporters of a national missile defense, and sharpen an election-year issue that Republicans want to wield against the Administration and Democrats in Congress.</p> <p>''It's a very sobering conclusion,'' said Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strong supporter of national missile defenses, who called on the Administration to work with Congress to address the heightened threat as described in the report.</p> <p>The United States has spent nearly $50 billion since the Reagan Administration to build a space- or land-based defense against ballistic missile strikes, but has yet to construct a workable network.</p> <p>Indeed, a report this month by the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, concluded that it is unlikely that a program to develop a national missile defense will meet an important deadline in 2000.</p> <p>In a 1996 deal with Congress, the Clinton Administration agreed to design and test a national defense by 2000 and then determine whether the technology was successful and whether the threat warranted deployment by 2003 at the earliest.</p> <p>But Republicans are seeking to field a system as soon as the technology is proved.</p> <p>The commission did not address the merit of any particular defensive system, focusing instead on the ballistic missile threat.</p> <p>''The major implication of our conclusions is that warning time is reduced,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.</p> <p>Mr. Rumsfeld has advocated continued research on the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based missile-defense system first outlined by former President Ronald Reagan, and he served as Presidential campaign chairman for Bob Dole, whose national security platform included a pledge to deploy, by 2003, a system to protect the United States against ballistic missiles.</p> <p>The commission singled out North Korea, Iran and Iraq for scrutiny.  ''We judge that Iran now has the technical capability and resources to demonstrate an I.C.B.M.-range ballistic missile'' similar to a North Korean model, its report said.</p> <p>But in a letter sent to Congress today, George J. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, said the Government stood by a threat assessment first made in 1995 and reaffirmed most recently in March.</p> <p>The Government assessments, Mr. Tenet wrote, ''were supported by the available evidence and were well tested'' in an internal review.</p> <p>But in its 300-page classified report delivered to the House and Senate today, as well as in an unclassified 27-page version, the panel said the American intelligence community was wrong in relying on the much-longer warning times.</p> <p>Mr. Rumsfeld said rogue nations, such as Iran and Iraq, had obtained sensitive missile technology, in part because of loosened export controls among industrialized nations. ''Foreign assistance is not a wild card,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''It is a fact of our relaxed post-cold war world.''</p> <p>Mr. Rumsfeld also said that suspect countries had become adept at concealing their missile programs, making it more difficult for Western intelligence analysts to gauge a country's progress and intentions.</p> <p>Senior intelligence officials told reporters today that the commission had examined the same information available to Government analysts, but had reached different conclusions. The officials said that they focused on specific evidence, assigning degrees of certainty to each assessment. They said the panel, whose official name is the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, took the same information, assumed the worst about what was not known for a particular country's missile program, and drew its conclusions.</p> <p>Mr. Rumsfeld concurred. ''We came at this subject as senior decision-makers would, who have to make difficult judgments based on limited information,'' he said.</p> <p>For that reason, the report, though praised by Republicans in particular, is likely to stoke debate over the missile threat rather than be viewed as the definitive conclusion.</p> <p>Mr. Rumsfeld said the panel reached different conclusions because it reviewed classified information about ballistic missiles that was not available to most analysts.</p> <p>A senior intelligence official acknowledged today that Mr. Rumsfeld had ''put his finger on a serious problem,'' and that intelligence agencies would work to relax the barriers that segregate, for security reasons, the dissemination of information among analysts.</p> <p>''A new strategic environment now gives emerging ballistic missile powers the capacity, through a combination of domestic development and foreign assistance, to acquire the means to strike the U.S. within about five years'' -- 10 years for Iraq -- ''after a decision to acquire such a capability,'' the report concluded.</p> <p>Republicans appointed six members to the commission, Democrats three. The members include R. James Woolsey, the former C.I.A. director; Barry M. Blechman, former assistant director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; physicist Richard L. Garwin; William R. Graham, former science adviser to President Reagan; William Schneider Jr., a former arms control adviser; Paul D. Wolfowitz, a senior Pentagon official under President Bush; and two former heads of the United States Strategic Command, Gen. Lee Butler and Gen. Larry D. Welch.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Iran's test of a medium-range missile on Wednesday apparently blew up in the later stages of the flight, American officials said today. But they said they did not know whether it had blown up on its own or whether the Iranians had detonated it on purpose before impact.</p> <p>The missile traveled far enough and well enough, however, to sharpen concern in Washington, Israel and the Persian Gulf countries about Iran's growing capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction in an arc that encompasses Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and parts of Egypt and Russia.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile today, a senior Administration official said tonight. The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, he said, and thus has the potential to alter the political and military balance of power in the Middle East.</p> <p>''This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the senior Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'currency']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin went over the head of the International Monetary Fund today and urged Western leaders to support a multibillion-dollar package of aid to defend Russia's currency.</p> <p>Russian officials say they are now seeking $20 billion or more, at least $10 billion of which they hope will come from the I.M.F. The total is $5 billion to $10 billion more than the Government previously said it needs, and the request to the fund is about twice what the fund has spoken of providing.</p>

Although his interpreter gentled that down to ''unwise,'' the Russian word means ''stupid.''</p> <p>The underlying reason for his irritation is probably a biographical aside I filed last year about his name: Primakov is the Ukrainian word for ''stepson.''

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'atomic energy']	<p>THE Treasury's announcement on Monday that it would soon privatize the Government's half-century-old uranium enrichment plants made waves largely because of the proposed method of sale. While an initial public offering of shares in a Government-owned corporation is not unprecedented, it is certainly a novelty in keeping with the spirit of the high-flying stock market.</p> <p>But the more important news is that the Treasury is moving forward in spite of years of warnings that the sale would undermine a key initiative for containing nuclear proliferation. For once the United States Enrichment Corporation is privatized, the company will have powerful financial incentives to find a means to back away from an agreement to import 500 tons of bomb-grade uranium from Russia.</p>

As Russia's stocks, bonds and currency took a pounding today, some Western investment bankers say Russia may need $20 billion or more to rebuild investor confidence.</p>
['religion and churches', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In February 1989, the last Soviet troops wearily crossed the bridge over the Amu Darya out of Afghanistan, a defeated army walking home to an empire on the verge of disintegration.</p> <p>Now, nearly a decade later, the Russians are back, secretly engaged in the new Afghan war, according to United States and foreign officials.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The international effort to calm Russia's shaky financial markets began to fall into place today, as negotiators sought to complete talks on more than $12 billion in new loans.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has informed Russian officials that it is now prepared to lend about $11 billion, Russian officials said. About half the sum would be provided up front and the rest would be disbursed by the end of this year.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>The Russians buried Czar Nicholas II today in true imperial fashion, beneath a ceiling of cherubim peeking from clouds, in a cathedral of mountainous oak and linden carvings sheathed in gold, among the white marble tombs of the czars who bestrode his empire for three centuries.</p> <p>And they buried him in the style of modern Russia, too: under imitation marble markers because there is no money for genuine stone; in a cathedral plundered by revolutionaries decades ago and half-restored today; at the center of enduring conflicts over whether the nation was venerating a monarch, a tyrant or even a fraud.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'computers and the internet']	<p>An I.B.M. subsidiary pleaded guilty today to illegally exporting 17 advanced computers to a Russian nuclear weapons laboratory and agreed to pay an $8.5 million fine in what Federal investigators believed was the first criminal conviction against I.B.M.</p> <p>Russia secretly bought the computers in late 1996 and early 1997 in the mistaken belief that Washington would approve the sale after Moscow signed a total ban on nuclear tests. The ban, long advocated by the United States, was agreed to by Russia in September 1996.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Boris Berezovsky had been waiting months for this moment of triumph, quietly plotting to depose Russia's earnest Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko.</p> <p>Last Saturday, Mr. Berezovsky went to the White House, the mammoth, Soviet-era Government headquarters that looms over the Moscow River, and there, in a private meeting with Anatoly B. Chubais, one of the Government's most passionate reformers, he told Mr. Chubais that the Kiriyenko team was finished. President Boris N. Yeltsin, the tycoon pronounced, would soon sign a decree dismissing the entire Cabinet.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'russia-international relations-us', 'stocks and bonds', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>Russia's financial markets rallied today after the Kremlin and the major Western powers indicated that they were working on another round of plans to end the nation's economic crisis.</p> <p>But with banks still shaky and the memory of Thursday's panic still fresh, brokers and analysts said they were not so much optimistic about a solution as relieved that today's markets had not completed the collapse that began the day before.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Exactly seven years after the abortive military putsch in Moscow that precipitated the collapse of Soviet Communism, Russia confronts yet another crisis. Back then, in August 1991, the consequences of the crisis appeared wholly benign, as it seemed to herald Russia's chance to move toward democracy and a market economy. Today, Russia's prospects are less clear and far more ominous.</p> <p>The current crisis has both political and economic causes.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'television']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin, reclaiming a bit of his old defiant nature, insisted on national television tonight that he would serve out his term as Russia's President and that, for him, resignation was impossible.</p> <p>But rumors and reality alike suggested today that his presidency, if it does last, is rushing toward figurehead status.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The scramble was on again today among President Clinton's already seriously scrambled aides.</p> <p>Three days before they are scheduled to leave for a summit meeting in Moscow, senior Administration officials wondered what Russians they would wind up facing across conference tables. Mr. Clinton's aides began rewriting his planned remarks on the future of United States-Russian relations.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances', 'law and legislation']	<p>One statistic stands out to explain the importance of Japan, along with its misery:</p> <p>When trading ended today at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japanese stocks this week alone had dropped in value by $241 billion -- a sum that exceeds the size of the entire annual output of the Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one glum week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of erasing Russia from the world map for a year.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Which do you think is scarier? Is it that Scott Ritter, the top U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, quit his job, accusing the U.S. and the U.N. of surrendering to Saddam Hussein? Or is it the story told by Russian economists about a Russian soldier behind the Urals who drove his army tank to City Hall to demand months of back pay? The soldier said he drove the tank not because he wanted to blow up the municipality but because he didn't have any other way to get there and couldn't afford cab fare. Or is it reading The Washington Post, where a State Department spokesman, James Foley, was quoted as saying that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright couldn't possibly be going soft on Iraq because, after all, ''Saddam Hussein has called Secretary Albright a snake and a witch, among other things''?</p> <p>What these disturbing stories suggest is that the basic pillars that have stabilized the post-cold-war world are all either shaking or crumbling. And that's scary.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Communist bureaucracy made Aleksandr I. Ginzburg stateless during the cold war. French bureaucracy would have left him stateless now if he had not raised his voice in protest.</p> <p>Mr. Ginzburg knows something about protest. As a poet and outspoken supporter of human rights in the Soviet Union, he was in prison for much of the 1960's and 1970's. He was freed and flown to the United States with four other imprisoned dissidents in 1979 in an exchange for two convicted Soviet spies.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Henry A. Kissinger says that if President Clinton backed out of the summit meeting in Moscow, it would mean certain political death for Boris Yeltsin.</p> <p>Brent Scowcroft says that it's a shame that Mr. Clinton scheduled his trip in the first place, but now he must live with the consequences and get on the plane to Moscow on Monday.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>With President Clinton's arrival for a summit meeting just days away, Russia's ad-hoc leadership sought to telegraph a message of stability today, saying neither economic crisis nor political bargaining with Communist legislators foreshadows a return to Soviet-style fiscal policy.</p> <p>The West continued to react coolly, its leaders repeating that nothing short of a thorough economic overhaul will win their approval for further loans to the Government.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>Locked in a tight national election campaign, German political leaders are coldly reappraising their longstanding willingness to bankroll Russia and to support its President, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the German Government has guaranteed about $30 billion worth of bank loans in Russia, largely to finance construction projects, the sale of heavy machinery and German investments in Russia. Beyond that, the Government has also pumped billions of dollars into development projects.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>President Clinton plans to depart for Moscow on Monday hoping to repair his scandal-stained image while offering comfort -- but no aid -- for the wounded President of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>Not since 1974 has an American President gone to Moscow in such a weak domestic position. President Nixon met with Leonid I. Brezhnev in late June of that year as the final chapters of the Watergate scandal were unfolding. The summit meeting gave a fleeting impression of an active President engaged in the international arena, but nothing of substance was accomplished. Five weeks after returning to Washington, Mr. Nixon resigned in disgrace.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>A $12 billion deal to turn surplus bomb uranium in Russia into fuel for American nuclear power plants is threatened by recent moves that will cut uranium prices and give Russia less revenue.</p> <p>The governmental agreement, drawn up in 1992, was intended to prevent Russia's highly enriched uranium, the fuel for the simplest nuclear bomb, from falling into the wrong hands and to provide hard currency to the cash-starved Russian Government.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Senior Clinton Administration officials said today that they were troubled by President Boris N. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his reformist Cabinet so close to the summit meeting with President Clinton next week in Moscow. But a spokesman said Mr. Clinton had decided to go ahead with his trip.</p> <p>Officials acknowledged that they were taken by surprise by the move, which also reinstated the former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. Five months ago, Mr. Yeltsin dismissed Mr. Chernomyrdin without warning and installed the young Sergei V. Kiriyenko as Prime Minister with a Cabinet of economic reformers with no evident political constituency.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'biographical information']	<p>The last time Viktor S. Chernomyrdin took the reins of the Russian Government from a brash band of reformers, in December 1992, he said nothing would change.</p> <p>''I am for deepening the reforms; there is no way back,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin pledged then, hours after President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his chief economic adviser, Yegor Gaidar, and made Mr. Chernomyrdin Prime Minister in his place. But things did change: By 1995 economic reform was near a standstill and Mr. Chernomyrdin let it be known that he thought Western market theory had done ''more harm than good.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>What can you say about a President who dismisses his Cabinet, then reappoints the Prime Minister he replaced five months ago, at a moment when his country is teetering on the edge of financial collapse?</p> <p>If nothing else, the latest surprise move by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is widely seen as an act of desperation, carried out at a moment when his political credibility and clout were in danger of being swept away by Russia's latest financial shock waves.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Throughout the 1980's, the Soviet Union threw almost every weapon it had, short of nuclear bombs, at the Afghan camps attacked by the United States last week.</p> <p>During their nine-year occupation of Afghanistan, the Soviets attacked the camps outside the town of Khost with Scud missiles, 500-pound bombs dropped from jets, barrages of artillery, flights of helicopter gunships and their crack special forces. The toughest Soviet commander in Afghanistan, Lieut. Gen. Boris Gromov, personally led the last assault.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin today dismissed his five-month-old team of economic reformers and reinstalled Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister in an anxious bid to shore up his political support.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's surprise decision came just five months after he derided Mr. Chernomyrdin as a spent force and cast him out of the Government.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>As Russia searches for a new Government and a program to pull the nation out of a tailspin, a fresh wave of panic swept through the country's financial institutions today. The currency plunged about 9 percent, three banks announced a merger to shore up their stability and the Government unveiled a plan to stretch out the repayment of its debt.</p> <p>Coming at a moment when Russia's newly designated Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was still negotiating with the Parliament over the makeup of his new Government, the ruble's abrupt drop stoked new fears of inflation similar to the spiraling rates that plunged Russia into a depression in the early 1990's.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'banks and banking', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>There is something about Russia's financial crises that won't quit, no matter how much money is thrown at them, no matter how hard the Government tries to do what its creditors expect.</p> <p>Less than one month after the International Monetary Fund promised a package of $22.6 billion in loans and credit to rescue the ruble from the brink, a new wave of panic has set in, sending shivers through the little that is left of Moscow's shattered financial markets.</p>
['biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Security Council closed ranks today to berate Iraq for ending cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors, but took no action other than to demand that Baghdad reverse its decision.</p> <p>But even as Iraq was isolated in the Security Council, the Government got mixed signals from Secretary General Kofi Annan, who suggested that the Iraqis, ''desperate'' for some movement toward ending sanctions, needed to be brought more closely into deliberations here.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'public opinion', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Nina Kostina cheered Boris Yeltsin's ascension to the Presidency in 1991. She voted to re-elect him in 1996. She expected to be comfortablein retirement by now. Instead she is a cleaning woman at the Old Moscow Circus, working 11-hour days and taking home $70 a month -- maybe -- after last week's ruble devaluation.</p> <p>It is better not to ask what she thinks about Mr. Yeltsin's promise today that his latest government shake-up will bring stability to Russia. ''I thought we would live normally,'' she said bitterly, trudging toward a Moscow Metro station as dusk fell this evening. ''He said to wait half a year, wait a year, wait another year. Now I've waited seven years -- and nothing. We don't expect anything better, because there's nothing good. I only count on my own self.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'finances', 'banks and banking']	<p>One day after he dismissed his Prime Minister, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signaled a new approach to governing today by giving a greater voice to the Communist-led forces in Parliament that have sought to frustrate economic reform.</p> <p>The new power-sharing arrangement is intended to build support for President Yeltsin's new choice for Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. But the move raised fresh questions about whether the Kremlin is retreating from the urgent economic reforms demanded by Mr. Chernomyrdin's predecessor, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, who was ousted over the weekend.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>It doesn't take much to set off a rumor in Moscow these days, as governments and policies are flipped around like flapjacks on a griddle.</p> <p>It was enough for Boris Berezovsky, a 51-year-old multibillionaire financier with an unquenchable political appetite, to be ''sighted in the vicinity of the office of the head of Government'' today to prompt a headline in an evening newspaper, and a new round of talk about the possible return to power of Mr. Berezovsky, a master intriguer.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>As Russia staggers through its financial crisis, few countries are watching with more anxiety than Germany.</p> <p>German banks are by far the biggest lenders to Russia, with about $30 billion in outstanding loans. The German Government has guaranteed repayment of most of that money, and stands to lose billions if the loans go completely sour.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>With great fanfare, Kremlin aides and Russian lawmakers announced a new accord today that would ease the bitter standoff over power-sharing between President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Communist-dominated Parliament.</p> <p>But within a few hours, the much celebrated breakthrough -- which was intended to pave the way for Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's confirmation as Prime Minister -- broke down, as the nation's political leaders squabbled on national television.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Judging by how the grand and improbable alliance between Russia's pro-capitalist leadership and its Communist critics exploded this evening -- on television, spectacularly, in a crossfire of accusations and threats -- one might think these people hadn't a clue about what to do with their country.</p> <p>In fact, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government and the Communists who run Parliament have plenty of ideas for keeping the country from sliding into insolvency, social chaos and third-world status. The problem is that their ideas are diametrically opposed.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Administration officials warily monitored the maneuvering to form a new Government in Moscow today, disturbed by possible signs of backsliding on Russia's commitment to tough economic changes but reluctant to render a verdict until new personnel and policies were in place.</p> <p>American officials avoided definitive comment in advance of President Clinton's arrival in Moscow on Tuesday, for fear of appearing to take sides in what promises to be a delicate negotiation among factions in Moscow over the next several days.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>Pressure mounted today on President Boris N. Yeltsin to cede some of his powers or even step aside as Russia's political leaders frantically negotiated over fundamental changes in the country's economic policies.</p> <p>Emboldened by Mr. Yeltsin's weakness, his political opponents pushed for a series of steps that would reverse seven years of an uneven transition to a democracy and a market economy. They also proposed to skirt the Constitution by usurping some of the President's powers and leaving him as a ceremonial head of the Government.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>When Russia was the heartland of what Ronald Reagan called the Evil Empire, bent on spreading Communist dogma and power around the globe, the United States developed economic, military and diplomatic weapons to contain and eventually to help eliminate the danger.</p> <p>Now Russia once again constitutes a threat to the rest of the world. Its inability to manage its economy has destabilized stock and currency markets from Moscow to Wall Street.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'atomic weapons']	<p>With the monetary crisis in Russia creating turmoil in global financial markets, concern grew in European capitals today that the crisis could throttle economic growth in their own countries or weaken Russia's commitment to democracy.</p> <p>But with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in the fight of his life for re-election a month from now and with President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive action during the United States-Russian summit meeting planned for next week in Moscow.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Almost nostalgically, it seemed, Russia reopened its cold war phrase book today to denounce the United States for its cruise-missile attacks on Afghanistan and the Sudan. But in almost the same breath, it declared that the differences would have no effect on President Clinton's trip to Moscow 10 days from now.</p> <p>On Russia's far-north Kola Peninsula, where he was witnessing naval exercises, President Boris N. Yeltsin said he was ''outraged'' by news of the American attacks and in particular by Mr. Clinton's failure to warn of them in advance. Afghanistan is on the southern border of the fraternity of former Soviet nations now called the Commonwealth of Independent States.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>An outspoken economic reformer has reportedly left the Russian Government, removing one of the last strong voices for free-market reform in the team being put together by Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov.</p> <p>The future of the official, Boris G. Fyodorov, a former Finance Minister who returned to the Government in the spring to spearhead an aggressive tax collection drive, has been closely watched here and abroad as a sign of whether the Primakov Government will represent a range of economic viewpoints or will tilt heavily toward policies favored by the Communists.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances']	<p>Record gains by Brazilian stocks accelerated today, the third consecutive day of a rally that has driven up the market 45 percent. The strong gains were fueled by a growing sense among investors that developed nations would protect Latin American economies from the devastation that has crippled Asia and Russia.</p> <p>In a financial crisis rooted in fear, and feeding on panic, the reality that any international bailout remained somewhat amorphous seemed almost beside the point. President Clinton's speech on Monday calling on advanced countries to support Latin economies, and suggestions in London by officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations of a new economic approach to promote growth in emerging markets, as distinct from a tight monetary policy, were enough for stocks to rally.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Security Council sent a warning to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia today to stop Serbian attacks on civilians in the ethnically Albanian Kosovo region or face international intervention.</p> <p>Only China did not support the resolution, saying that the Kosovo crisis was an internal matter for Yugoslavia, which was acting within its ''legitimate rights.''</p>
['banks and banking', 'finances', 'currency']	<p>As Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has battled to become Prime Minister, critics have wondered how he could placate the Communists and still take tough steps to rescue Russia from its deepening economic crisis.</p> <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin gave his answer today: By turns.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'banks and banking', 'currency']	<p>Hours after Russia's Acting Prime Minister finally laid out his program to pull the country out of its economic crisis, Parliament today put off a crucial vote on the new Government until Monday, buying more time for political negotiations.</p> <p>Battling for support from reluctant lawmakers, the appointee, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, spelled out a series of economic remedies for the next four months. Initially the plan would risk soaring inflation by printing money to shore up Russia's troubled banking system, then shift course by pushing the country into what Mr. Chernomyrdin called an ''economic dictatorship,'' where the money supply would be rigidly controlled and failing factories could face bankruptcy for the first time. [Page A8.]</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>Today might be one of those rare heady days for Russia's post-Soviet Communists, if only someone could say what a post-Soviet Communist is.</p> <p>The Communist Party in Russia's Parliament, the legislature's biggest, used to crumple under President Boris N. Yeltsin's glare. Today it contemptuously threw back his choice of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister for the second time, demanding the restoration of part of its old power and threatening to block a new government -- and risk bringing Russia to its knees if need be.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's Parliament again spurned President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister today after last-minute negotiations between the Kremlin and a defiant Communist opposition broke down.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin gave no signs of backing down tonight over his nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister. That set the stage for another debilitating round of political wrangling as the economy continued to reel out of control.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>While anxiety over Russia's deepening economic crisis spread, Acting Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said today that he would form an acting cabinet without waiting for parliamentary approval.</p> <p>''In the current, most grave situation, the country cannot stay without a government,'' he told a meeting of Russian officials. ''Delays and inaction may throw us back several years. This will not happen. We must not allow this under any circumstances.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'atomic weapons', 'finances']	<p>President Clinton delivered a sober lecture to Russian leaders and the Russian people today about the hard realities of capitalism and the price of international support for relief from Russia's current financial crisis.</p> <p>In meetings with President Boris N. Yeltsin and the temporary caretakers of Russia's paralyzed political and economic institutions, and in a speech to students at a Moscow university, Mr. Clinton warned that there is no easy escape from the financial catastrophe that has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid and caused the collapse of the Government.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Europe and the United States today shunted aside a call from Japan for an emergency meeting of the world's largest economies to deal with Russia's economic crisis.</p> <p>At the same time, leaders in several nations cast about for a fresh strategy to contain virulent outbreaks of economic instability.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'space', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>During the frigid days of the cold war, American satellites watched for the fiery launchings of Soviet missiles, a sign that the United States might soon be under nuclear attack.</p> <p>Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States has found a new use for its warning systems. It plans to employ them to alert the Russians about missile launchings around the world.</p>
['television', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As President and Mrs. Clinton prepared to retire tonight at the Marriott Hotel near the banks of the Moscow River, a car pulled over not far from the hotel entrance. The doors opened, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who controls a bloc of seats in Russia's Parliament, climbed out.</p> <p>Mr. Zhirinovsky turned toward the hotel and yelled, in so many exceptionally unprintable words, ''Clinton, you are an idiot!'' After applying the coarsest description of sexual relations to the President, he added, ''Your dollar is dirt, and this dirt is all over the world!''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>The Russian Government's most outspoken reformer was ousted from his post today, leaving policy in the hands of a unlikely coalition of Communists, regional leaders and Yeltsin holdovers.</p> <p>The reformer, Boris G. Fyodorov, who was chief tax collector and top economic policy maker, was removed from both positions, the Kremlin said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>In selecting Yevgeny M. Primakov for Prime Minister, President Boris N. Yeltsin has picked a wily diplomat and steely opponent of American dominance.</p> <p>There is no question that the choice of Mr. Primakov, a foreign policy strategist and former intelligence chief, is a popular one for the Communist opposition and for Russians who miss the stability of Soviet times.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The Clinton Administration today welcomed the nomination of Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov as Russia's next Prime Minister, with officials describing him as a sure-footed survivor whose appointment could help defuse a political and economic crisis that had threatened to bring down President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p> <p>''Obviously the United States knows and respects the Foreign Minister, Primakov,'' said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. ''We've worked closely with him. If ratified by the Duma, we would expect to have a good and close working relationship with Prime Minister Primakov.''</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>Brazilian markets, caving in under the international financial crisis and the Government's failure over the last four years to make crucial changes, careered toward record losses today, with emergency measures over the last week proving futile to end the slide in investor confidence.</p> <p>As the Sao Paulo exchange fell, whizzing past the 11 percent mark early this morning and past 15 percent at 4:30 P.M., the market here halted trading twice in one day, for the first time in its history. When trading resumed, so did the selloffs, with the market closing down 15.8 percent.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'law and legislation']	<p>Washington has been so distracted by President Clinton's troubles, by the slow-motion collapse of the Russian Government and by the continuing meltdown of Asia that few here have had time to consider what could set off the next wave of economic turmoil.</p> <p>But today Washington and Wall Street, two universes rarely in sync, got a taste of what may be coming.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>Summoned back from a decade of obscurity, a group of Gorbachev-era economists stood outside the gates of the Russian Government building today, awaiting their turn to give advice on how to rescue a floundering economy.</p> <p>Ten years ago, these men were the talking heads of perestroika, the name given to reforms launched by then-Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- which in due course, led to the collapse of Communism, the end of the Soviet Union.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'ethics']	<p>It has been a question from the start of President Clinton's five-day trip to Russia, Ireland and Northern Ireland this week: will his domestic troubles affect his ability to function abroad as the nation's leader?</p> <p>The answer, from the President's aides, has been a resounding and unanimous no.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Following are excerpts from statements today by Russian political leaders in the debate over the nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to be Prime Minister, as translated by The New York Times:</p> <p>Viktor S. Chernomyrdin  Acting Prime Minister</p> <p>You know that I have always been open to constructive dialogue. And I do not shirk dialogue today. But time is running out.</p> <p>Seven days ago the President again asked me to head the Government. It was a difficult choice for me -- not only because the country finds itself in such a serious situation. During the last six months I have been able to see more clearly many things and many people whom I have dealt with during my many years of work.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's Parliament today emphatically rejected President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister after a rancorous  debate, leaving the nation virtually rudderless in the midst of its deepening economic crisis.</p> <p>Viktor S. Chernomyrdin implored lawmakers to approve his appointment as Prime Minister, saying he urgently needed to start forming a new government.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>In the eyes of many of his fellow leaders and ordinary people around the world, President Clinton has lost personal stature since investigations into his private life and his admission of an inappropriate relationship with a White House intern. But he has lost little of the authority and power conferred on him by the Presidency.</p> <p>Some, particularly in the Muslim world, fear that Mr. Clinton no longer has the moral authority to use his power in ways they would like to see.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Russia's top network news program, ''Vremya,'' led off tonight with Parliament's rejection of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, the ruble's continued wobbliness and the anniversary of Diana's death. Then it flagged fascinating plans by Muslim extremists for several villages in rural Dagestan.</p> <p>And oh, yes -- the President of the United States arrives Tuesday morning for a summit meeting with the President of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin. That item was relegated to the second half of the newscast.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin made a rare appearance in public last Wednesday evening at a gala concert at Moscow's Conservatory. At least, he was there for the start of a performance by the Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and Seiji Ozawa, the Boston Symphony's conductor.</p> <p>By intermission, he was gone.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>On Monday President Clinton declared that in the midst of the greatest economic turmoil in a half-century, ''the industrial world's chief priority today, plainly, is to spur growth.'' The markets soared, figuring that the combination of a Presidential call to arms and a statement issued the same day by the seven largest industrial economies meant coordinated action was on the way -- chiefly a cut in interest rates.</p> <p>By Wednesday afternoon, that hope was dashed. First Germany, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said that ''there is no endeavor to coordinate interest rate cuts.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Russia's leaders offered more assurances today that the country's fiscal crisis could be tamed without provoking high inflation or social unrest. But with key positions in the new Government unfilled, few people seemed to accord the promises much weight.</p> <p>Neither President Boris N. Yeltsin nor his new Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, has settled on a choice for Finance Minister, perhaps the most important post next to Mr. Primakov's. The Finance Minister will carry out many of the Government's crisis measures.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'space', 'russia-international relations-us', 'space stations']	<p>Worried that trouble in Moscow is threatening its own dreams, NASA wants to spend up to $660 million over five years to bail out its Russian partner in building a planned international space station, agency officials said yesterday.</p> <p>Key members of Congress immediately faulted the proposal as too expensive, clouding the fate of the biggest science project of all time. But NASA officials argued that the American and Russian programs were now linked so intimately that the Russian effort must be preserved lest the American space program suffer greatly.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>As President Boris N. Yeltsin pondered for a second day over who would be his next Prime Minister, the Communists threatened today to pursue impeachment if he renominated Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.</p> <p>The warning was meant to induce Mr. Yeltsin to abandon Mr. Chernomyrdin. In Russia's byzantine politics, it was also a defensive maneuver to block the President from dissolving the Parliament. A vote to impeach would prevent the President from dissolving the Parliament for several months, according to the Constitution.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>Russia struggled through another day without a Government; the ruble's value fell again; people had less money than ever, and spirits and fortunes sagged.</p> <p>''The situation is worse than in 1917,'' the year that the Bolsheviks seized power in a country depleted by war and government indecision, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the regional governor with presidential ambitions, said he told President Clinton today.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'foreign aid', 'currency']	<p>President Clinton signaled today that the West would step up its aid to Russia if the Kremlin pressed ahead with tough economic reforms.</p> <p>His message, intended to encourage the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin to stick with its pro-capitalist course despite the nation's deepening economic crisis, was the most striking development as a two-day summit meeting ended. It was dominated by a collapsing ruble and a Government paralyzed by its battles with a Communist opposition.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>The big news in Russia today was what did not happen.</p> <p>After the Communist-led Parliament, in a stormy debate on Monday, again rejected Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, President Boris N. Yeltsin's  choice for Prime Minister, the President did not rush to renominate him.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'finances']	<p>Fearful of being swept up in the financial turmoil that has devastated Asia and Russia, officials from nine Latin American nations said today that their economies were basically sound and should not be penalized indiscriminately by panicky investors.</p> <p>Arriving for the start of a two-day meeting with the International Monetary Fund, the officials said that they were not seeking any international financial help, and that they were taking the difficult steps needed to weather a storm that is threatening to batter much of the world.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>The wasting disease now ravaging Russia's ruble and its banks has begun to infect everyday commerce in shops and groceries, with unsettling implications -- not just for ordinary citizens, but for the Russian Government, which rises and falls on their trust.</p> <p>From personal visits, interviews and anecdotal reports on the Internet and in newspapers, it is apparent that many food markets and hard-goods stores are running out of popular items, from rice to televisions. Moreover, retailers are finding it increasingly hard to replenish their inventories.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The chief United Nations weapons inspector for Iraq said today that the Government of Saddam Hussein had gone beyond its decision to block surprise inspections and is now interfering with routine monitoring operations.</p> <p>The inspector, Richard Butler, told the Security Council about the deteriorating situation in Iraq as the United States and Britain moved to keep comprehensive sanctions on the Iraqis until they resume cooperation.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The Soviet Union leveled the conifers and birches of the west Siberian taiga and threw up this town 34 years ago for one reason only. The red-and-white sign at the outskirts, under the drawing of a coal-cutting tool emblazoned on a birch leaf, sums it up: ''City of Miners' Glory.''</p> <p>The sign is a lie. There is no glory here, just unrelieved bleakness -- bleakness, and talk of revolt.</p>
['television']	<p>A history of the cold war, which ran for close to half a century and was played out on several continents, is no small undertaking. In recognition of the subject's scope, CNN's new series allows it 24 episodes, one a week beginning on Sunday with an introduction to Soviet-American relations and concluding next spring with the fall of the Berlin wall. It's an ambitiously conceived, intelligently executed project.</p> <p>Many of the main events, like the Berlin airlift, the Cuban missile crisis and, of course, the Vietnam War have been treated before on television, but they are infused with fresh drama by newly unearthed and reconstructed newsreels, demonstrating once again the ingenuity of enterprising researchers.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Winning approval from Russia's strident and stubborn Parliament on Friday turned out to be an easy day's work for Russia's new Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, the savvy diplomat who has made a career of playing both ends against the middle.</p> <p>Now comes the hard part as the 68-year-old former intelligence chief sorts through the pile of conflicting economic plans and emergency measures he inherited on taking office, and which today continued to pour in from all sides.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>On the night before Russia's Parliament is to vote again on whether he becomes Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin warned on national television that the nation has entered a fiscal nose dive and that further political squabbling could lead to social chaos.</p> <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has been serving as Acting Prime Minister, also said tonight that the economic situation was so dire that ''no classical anti-crisis measures apply,'' an assessment that seemed intended to defend seemingly contradictory parts of a fiscal platform he outlined on Friday.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'currency']	<p>During the last few months in Russia, no one could be blamed for asking, ''Can this nation be saved?''</p> <p>In July, the International Monetary Fund sent Russia $4.8 billion to prop up the wildly overvalued ruble. The I.M.F. and the Russian Central Bank did everything possible to prevent devaluation, fearing that it would inhibit foreign investment. In August, the central bank was spending nearly $500 million a day to do so.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Three days after his spokesman insisted that he had conquered bronchitis, enjoyed normal health and was wounded by rumor mongering to the contrary, President Boris N. Yeltsin called off a one-day visit to Austria today.</p> <p>The spokesman said Mr. Yeltsin, 67, now suffers from ''unstable blood pressure and undue fatigue'' caused by his refusal to stop working during his recovery from bronchitis.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'banks and banking', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Scott R. Mackie doesn't envy his old boss.</p> <p>Before he took over recently as head of General Motors Poland, Mr. Mackie worked at G.M.'s big German unit, Opel, under David J. Herman. In June,  G.M. dispatched Mr. Herman to Moscow, where he is now puzzling out a strategy in the wake of Russia's troubled collision with capitalism.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>As United States bombers landed in Britain for a buildup of NATO forces ready to strike against Slobodan Milosevic, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American envoy, pressed the Yugoslav leader for a sixth day to back down in his confrontation with the West over Kosovo.</p> <p>The pressure on Mr. Milosevic is expected to reach its peak on Monday when the 16 representatives to NATO in Brussels are scheduled to approve an activation order, authorizing the use of air strikes against Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>As the global economic crisis spreads, the World Bank fears that it will be made to transform itself from a slow-moving development agency into a financial fire truck, programmed to squirt streams of cash at countries under speculative attack as part of a plan to head off such crises.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund, which was expressly created to perform the job of emergency financial rescue, is in danger of becoming sidelined in the present emergency. After advancing huge loans to Asia and Russia, it has only enough cash left for one more big rescue operation unless the United States Congress overcomes its hostility to giving it new funds.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>If the Commu nist Party has its way  and it has been planning for months -- millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years.</p> <p>But now that Communists or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the country and its economy, the question is what the marchers will be demonstrating against.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's new Prime Minister, would seem to have little choice but to pony up back wages owed to millions of Russian workers, some of whom haven't been paid in more than two years. But Mr. Primakov's solution -- printing a mass of new rubles -- has an air of unreality about it.</p> <p>Money can be printed, but how much of it will reach the unpaid? Rubles transferred by Moscow to the country's 89 regions continue to disappear without a trace, as local officials siphon them off for themselves. Russia has an inordinate number of state functionaries but no functioning state. This paralyzing circumstance constitutes the essence of the political crisis.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Under NATO threat to end his punishing offensive against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has ordered most units of his army back to their barracks and may well avoid an attack by the alliance, military observers and diplomats say.</p> <p>Mr. Milosevic, who on one hand is excoriated by Washington as the scourge of Kosovo yet on the other is treated as key to peace in Bosnia, acted as the European Union, NATO and the United Nations prepared for a review on Monday of possible military intervention.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>With his long hair and dark blue beret, Vladimir Tyuterev, 31, didn't look like most of the other demonstrators at today's mass protest in Moscow.</p> <p>He was not waving a red flag like the Communists. He was not dressed in black like the members of nationalist youth groups. He did not carry a placard calling for President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Red banners flapping in the breeze, Communists and trade unionists led a nationwide strike today to protest President Boris N. Yeltsin's rule.</p> <p>In Moscow, thousands of protesters marched toward the Kremlin during a brilliantly sunny day to demand that Mr. Yeltsin resign. In Vladivostok, the improverished port city on Russia's Pacific Coast, strikers briefly blocked a road.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>As President Boris N. Yeltsin prepares to fly on Friday to a Black Sea resort on an extended sick leave, a Kremlin spokesman said today that the President would soon name a panel of legal experts to review changes to the Russian Constitution, including creating a post for a vice president and successor.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, 67, has already stepped back from the day-to-day business of running the country, a fact that the Kremlin officially confirmed this week after his latest bout of ''nervous exhaustion.'' Now, according to his chief spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, Mr. Yeltsin will have time ''to plan other things,'' in particular his handover of power in 2000,  when his term ends.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A two-year campaign by the Clinton Administration to persuade major oil companies that they should quickly build a multi-billion-dollar pipeline in the Caucasus, a campaign that has become a centerpiece of American foreign policy, appears to be on the brink of failure.</p> <p>Companies from the United States and seven other nations are to make a decision this month about how to begin transporting the vast amounts of oil that are believed to lie near the Caspian Sea. For the region's fragile new nations, wedged between Russia and Iran, the decision may be a momentous turning point.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation']	<p>Now that Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov has spent six weeks leading one of the biggest nations in the world through its worst fiscal crisis, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: nobody outside the Kremlin knows what the Prime Minister is doing.</p> <p>Whether this is by design or accident, or good or bad, is open to dispute. But it is indisputably making economists, financiers and politicians nervous.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia mounted a last-ditch campaign today to avert NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia, warning that such strikes could bring an end to cooperation with the Western alliance.</p> <p>The intensity of Russia's diplomacy reflected the ascension of Yevgeny M. Primakov, the Foreign Minister turned Prime Minister, who has often cast Moscow as a wounded great power in an open-ended struggle with the West.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly cut short a three-day visit to Central Asia today after the his doctor announced that Mr. Yeltsin was suffering from bronchitis and a slight fever.</p> <p>But the Kremlin's record of covering up the President's health problems left many commentators questioning whether Mr. Yeltsin's illness was more serious. It also compounded the sense that the nation lacked a fully functioning leader during one of its gravest crises.</p>
['foreign aid', 'finances']	<p>WHEAT OFF 2.6 PERCENT.  Prices fell on doubts that the United States will donate food to Russia, dimming hopes for reduced supplies and more demand. The December contract dropped 7.75 cents, to $2.8625 a bushel.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'war and revolution', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare']	<p>Russia vowed today to veto any attempt by the United Nations to authorize air strikes against Yugoslavia and warned of ''serious international consequences'' if NATO proceeds with force to halt the ethnic conflict in Kosovo Province.</p> <p>Russia's stepped-up effort to insert itself into the diplomatic wrangling over Kosovo comes as Russian officials in Washington and elsewhere are pressing the West to rescue their foundering economy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Administration today intensified its threat to use force against the Yugoslav military and the police, as Washington continued diplomatic efforts to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to end the crackdown in Kosovo.</p> <p>And in a move to maintain NATO unity behind military action, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright wrote to the group's 15 other members over the weekend to urge them to give NATO's commanders the authority to use force against the Serbs in Yugoslavia. Some allies resist that step; a vote on approving force, which was to take place in Brussels on Wednesday, has been delayed to the end of the week at the earliest.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Russia's Prime Minister made an extraordinary appeal for calm tonight as millions of Communists and trade unionists prepared nationwide strikes over the ravaged economy.</p> <p>''The way out of the crisis for Russia is in public order and consent, stability and discipline,'' the Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said in a televised address. ''I would to like call on everybody not to rock our common boat in today's stormy seas.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>As President Clinton argued anew today that ''we must find a way to temper the volatile swings of the international marketplace,'' the president of the World Bank publicly broke with the approach that the United States and the International Monetary Fund have taken in managing the global crisis.</p> <p>In a speech to the finance ministers and central bank governors from 182 nations meeting here, James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, said that in the rush to stabilize currencies and bring about economic reform, too little attention was being paid to the growing ranks of unemployed and the risks of undercutting political stability. ''The poor cannot wait on our deliberations,'' he said.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>Rocked by its worst harvest in 45 years and a plummeting ruble, Russia appealed today for relief aid from the European Union. It has also approached the United States and Canada for help.</p> <p>Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov broached the question of relief at a meeting today with Jacques Santer, the President of the European Union. ''There has been a request for humanitarian aid,'' a spokeswoman for Mr. Santer said. ''There are no details yet.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States and NATO worked today to keep the military pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as he continued to resist complying with international demands to withdraw Serbian troops and police forces from the province of Kosovo.</p> <p>A day after NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, met with Mr. Milosevic and Yugoslav military leaders to demand more withdrawals, there were no signs today that any of the forces were in fact pulling back, NATO and Administration officials said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'russia-international relations-us', 'currency']	<p>The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian Government of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy.</p> <p>In her first comprehensive review of United States-Russian relations since Mr. Primakov was confirmed as Prime Minister last month, Ms. Albright said Washington was ''deeply concerned'' about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate.</p>
['ethics']	<p>Transparency International, a small independent organization that has been tracking for four years how the public and international businesses view corruption worldwide, has published its largest survey to date, looking at 85 countries and ranking only one completely clean: Denmark.</p> <p>The 1998 Corruption Perception Index, like its predecessors, is a ''survey of surveys,'' using a combination of studies by risk analysts, opinion polls and research institutions to rank countries by how they are perceived. ''No surveying approach is perfect,'' Frank Vogl, vice president of Transparency International and a former World Bank official, said of the report released last week. ''At best we get a good set of impressions.''</p>
['books and literature', 'biographical information']	<p>During the 40 years before his death in 1975, the composer Dmitri Shostakovich was no stranger to life-and-death controversy. In 1936 Stalin attacked his opera ''Lady Macbeth,'' as ''crude, primitive, vulgar''; the composer feared for his life. Then, in 1948, an even larger attack was mounted on his musical style; Shostakovich lost his teaching job and again expected brutal knocks on the door.</p> <p>Now the spirit of Shostakovich is hovering over a Western debate that recalls that earlier era in its heat and vituperation. ''Moronic tract,'' one scholar asserts about another's work; ''borderline fraudulent'' is a return volley.  ''Classic Soviet-style denunciation,'' declares one polemicist; ''McCarthyites,'' says another critic. And the point of contention? A book published 19 years ago, ''Testimony: The Memoirs of Dmitri Shostakovich.''</p>
['finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>HOGS RISE 1.9 PERCENT.  Prices strengthened from four-year lows after the United States said it would donate pork to Russia. The December contract for lean hog carcasses rose 0.65 cent to settle at 35.85 cents a pound.</p>
['espionage']	<p>The history of American anti-Communism is being rewritten as we speak. The impetus is the emergence of recently declassified files in Russia and the United States that were secret for decades. These documents have confirmed that Soviet intelligence gained a foothold in the American Government in the 1930's and 40's, and that Russian spy masters could count on their comrades in the United States for support.</p> <p>In the wake of these disclosures, there is baseless concern that dangerous anti-Communists, notably Senator Joseph McCarthy, will be rehabilitated. In fact, historians have long been aware of Communist spying. The files are a treasure trove for researchers, but the overall effect of the new information is not surprising. Furthermore, McCarthy, who was censured by the Senate in 1954 and died of alcoholism three years later, had no part in the great espionage dramas of his time. What set him apart was his enthusiasm for lying on a grand scale.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>The burning question for the Kremlin these days is not the future of capitalism, the lack of a national program or NATO's creeping to the East.</p> <p>It is about food.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As the United States continued to build up its forces for a possible attack on Iraq, an eerie silence on the diplomatic front has made this crisis different from previous confrontations with Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>This time, there were no last-minute efforts to mediate with the Iraqis, no high-level Russian or French envoys rushing to Baghdad and no plans for Secretary General Kofi Annan to intervene, as he did in February when the United States last threatened to attack. Mr. Annan, who returned this afternoon from an aborted trip to North Africa, will not meet the Security Council until Friday.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Iraq threw up a new roadblock to the work of United Nations arms inspectors yesterday, less than a week after agreeing to cooperate.</p> <p>In the latest twist in the dispute between the United Nations and Iraq over the prohibited arms, Iraq balked at handing over documents on chemical and biological weapons and missile systems.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States is planning to provide millions of tons of food to help Russians stave off hunger and endure a bitter winter.</p> <p>American officials said today that at least 3.1 million metric tons of food would be provided under an accord being negotiated with Moscow. Much of the food would be provided free. The rest would be sold with generous long-term financing.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us', 'ethics']	<p>The Central Intelligence Agency said today that it had provided many reports on the corruption of senior Russian officials to the Clinton Administration.</p> <p>The agency strongly denied that its analysts had censored themselves after concluding that senior Administration officials did not want evidence of corruption to obstruct doing business with the Russian leadership.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Thousands of mourners waited hours in the bitter cold today to pay an emotional and politically charged farewell to a liberal legislator whose killing on Friday has turned into a call to arms for Russia's frayed democratic forces.</p> <p>Inside the ornate Marble Hall at the Museum of Ethnography, where the lawmaker, Galina V. Starovoitova, lay in state, her grim-faced friends and allies issued a challenge to those who, many believe, ordered a brazen political assassination.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The killing Friday night in St. Petersburg of Galina V. Starovoitova, a leading liberal politician and tireless defender of Russia's democratic reforms, shocked her old allies who claimed her as the latest victim of the country's lethally corrupt political climate.</p> <p>Today President Boris N. Yeltsin sent his top law-enforcement officials to investigate the shooting death of the 52-year-old parliamentary deputy, who had been his close associate during the early years of Russia's transition from Communism to democracy, and served as his adviser on interethnic affairs.</p>
['ethics', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's capital city, which has seemed unwilling to muster even medium dudgeon anymore on questions of politicians and politics, is suddenly buzzing over an allegation that virtually all Muscovites regard as a given: that the Government is corrupt.</p> <p>The accuser is Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a respected if ideological reformer and legislator who was the first politician to tout Yevgeny M. Primakov for the post of Prime Minister last month.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>When Andrei B. Sokolov came to this nuclear city more than 30 years ago, it was a bastion of privilege for the Soviet Union's scientific elite.</p> <p>Its very existence was a state secret. Behind barbed-wire fences and hidden inside a mountain, three nuclear reactors produced tons of plutonium for the country's nuclear arsenal. Its scientists, the nation's brightest, lived the Soviet dream: the best food and wages the Kremlin could provide.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Security Council voted unanimously today to condemn Iraq and demand that President Saddam Hussein rescind his ban on cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors. But the Council stopped short of authorizing or even mentioning the use of force to back its demand.</p> <p>The resolution, making formal the outrage first expressed by Council members on Saturday after Iraq effectively shut down the arms monitoring system, comes in the face of reports that the United States may be preparing for military action against Iraq.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Soon after dawn each day, the promenade that runs along the shore of the Caspian Sea here fills with Americans and other expatriates out for a morning run.</p> <p>Many of them are Texas oilmen, and after dark they congregate at Margaritaville, a Tex-Mex restaurant that serves tacos, enchiladas and refried beans. Gas executives from Louisiana prefer the jambalaya and gumbo at another favorite haunt, the Ragin' Cajun. Later, some join the newly rich Azerbaijanis who pack glittery local discos.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Later this week, President Clinton heads for the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which this year, by quirky fate, is being held in Malaysia, a country that has denounced the West, rejected the International Monetary Fund's approach to the Asian crisis and tried to stop all trading in its currency. While in Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Clinton will also be seeing the President of China and the new Prime Minister of Russia.</p>
['elections', 'international trade and world market']	<p>President Clinton said for the first time today that the United States would not tolerate the ''flooding of our markets'' with low-cost goods from Asia and Russia, particularly steel, that are threatening the jobs of American workers.</p> <p>The President's statement came days after a White House meeting of top executives of steel companies and the United Steelworkers of America, which helped get out the vote for Democrats last week, playing a pivotal role with other unions in the party's success in midterm elections.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>In this century, this city has made more than its share of history and seen more than its share of blood. It was here in 1917 that the Romanov dynasty fell and the Bolshevik revolution began. The murder here in 1934 of a local Communist commissar unleashed Stalin's campaign of terror, which sent millions to camps in Siberia and to their deaths.</p> <p>And so for many Russians, there was an eerie echo to the shots fired in a stairwell off the ice-bound Griboyedova Canal, killing Galina Starovoitova, a 52-year-old Russian legislator known for her fierce defense of democracy and her down-to-earth common sense.</p>
['ethics']	<p>When the Central Intelligence Agency uncovered what its analysts considered to be conclusive evidence of the personal corruption of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia in 1995, they sent it to the White House, expecting Clinton Administration officials to be impressed with their work.</p> <p>Instead, when the secret C.I.A. report on Mr. Chernomyrdin arrived in the office of Vice President Al Gore, it was rejected and sent back to the C.I.A. with a barnyard epithet scrawled across its cover, according to several intelligence officials familiar with the incident.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'biographical information', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Mourners bearing flowers and candles gathered today outside the house on Griboyedova Canal where a Russian legislator, Galina V. Starovoitova, was shot to death on Friday night.</p> <p>A key witness, Ruslan Linkov, 27, Mrs. Starovoitova's press aide, was reported to be regaining consciousness in a heavily guarded hospital ward where he was taken with wounds to the head and neck.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>All fall, as Russia drifted from crisis to crisis, Yuri M. Luzhkov, the pugnacious and energetic mayor of Moscow, kept trying to jump-start his undeclared campaign to succeed President Boris N. Yeltsin, using every opportunity to muscle his way onto the national stage.</p> <p>As the undisputed boss of Russia's biggest city, Mr. Luzhkov already has a political arsenal. With control over a major television station, several key newspapers and the country's second largest printing press, he has considerable sway over the news media. And with his grip on the city's large business and financial empire, he does not lack for funds.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>After six weeks of labored effort to rebound from bronchitis, most of it spent at resorts and dachas far from the Kremlin levers of power, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia developed a high fever and pneumonia on Sunday and spent today in Moscow's best hospital.</p> <p>Ignoring doctors' advice, as he often does, Mr. Yeltsin summoned China's President, Jiang Zemin, to his suite at Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital for a long-scheduled state visit. Russian television broadcast silent film of the two men in conversation, Mr. Yeltsin gesticulating forcefully, but looking wan in a black cardigan sweater.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>The Russian Government said today for the first time that it will not pay its foreign debts next year, and will seek to renegotiate the loans.</p> <p>Today's announcement is just the latest in a litany of familiar setbacks here that includes a collapsing currency, a yawning budget deficit and a deteriorating economy.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power']	<p>The recent drop in the price of oil and natural gas and the continuing decline of other commodity prices at year's end is putting renewed pressure on many of the emerging-market countries at the center of the global financial crisis.</p> <p>Many of the world's most troubled nations -- economically, politically, or both -- depend on the sale of commodities for a major part of their economic growth and government revenue.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>As delicate negotiations over a new international policy on Iraq go on behind the scenes here, President Saddam Hussein is complicating his situation in the Security Council with a stream of bellicose statements against not only his enemies in London and Washington but also friends like Russia and France and his Arab neighbors.</p> <p>In addition, Iraqis are sending mixed signals about their remaining ties with the United Nations, which administers a huge relief program in the country. Iraq has already said it will never allow arms inspectors back, but it has generally cooperated with aid workers.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>After a sordid campaign overshadowed by the killing last month of a leading liberal politician, the citizens of St. Petersburg, Russia's second largest city, voted in record numbers on Sunday,  and today's preliminary results indicated that they had improved the fortunes of the city's embattled democratic alliance.</p> <p>The assassination on Nov. 20 of Galina V. Starovoitova, a national democratic politician with a strong following in St. Petersburg, her native city, drew special attention to these City Council elections. They had already been widely seen as a crude attempt by murky criminal and commercial forces to stake out more turf in city politics.</p>
['biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In Russia's scientific despair, the United States has sensed great danger and opportunity.</p> <p>American officials have been worried about Russia's weapons programs from the moment the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Initially, the focus was on improving security for nuclear weapons and scientists. The germ warfare program was hardly considered.</p>
['treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Iran is scouring the former Soviet Union to hire scientists who once worked in laboratories tied to Moscow's vast germ warfare program and has succeeded in recruiting some of them to take jobs in Teheran, according to Russian scientists and American officials.</p> <p>Iranian officials who report to their leadership have approached dozens of scientists who once made germ weapons, offering as much as $5,000 a month to people who make far less than that a year in the increasingly chaotic Russian economy.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin came to his Kremlin office today just long enough to dismiss four top aides and proclaim that he is retaking control of his Government's skidding tax-collection and crime-fighting agencies.</p> <p>Then he returned to a Moscow hospital, continuing a recovery from pneumonia that has stretched to 15 days and seemingly rendered him an asterisk in the Kremlin power structure -- at least until now.</p>
['banks and banking', 'economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>Russia failed to make a $362 million payment today on Soviet-era debt that it owes to commercial banks around the world, a move that American officials, the International Monetary Fund and lenders to Russia fear could signal a growing movement in Moscow to simply default on the country's obligations.</p> <p>The lenders, led by the Bank of America,  stopped short of calling today's action a default, even though it appeared to be exactly that. In August, in the midst of the devaluation of the ruble and the dismissal of the economic reformers who had negotiated a bailout of the country with the International Monetary Fund, Russia failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars it owed to foreign governments. But today's action was the first in which it failed to pay private creditors, on whom the country's chances of economic recovery hinge.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia recalled its ambassador to Washington today for consultations as a protest for United States' air strikes against Iraq, Moscow's angriest riposte against American policy since the end of the cold war.</p> <p>The Kremlin's decision to withdraw Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov came as politicians across Russian's political spectrum, usually divided over how to solve the country's own tangled problems, united today and denounced the American attacks.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In the last two days, as United Nations arms inspectors abruptly left Iraq and military strikes began, divisions in the Security Council have reverted to cold war patterns, diplomats said today.</p> <p>Russia has demanded the resignation of the chief weapons inspector, accusing him of being dishonorable in his dealings with the Council and  colluding with Washington to set Iraq up for attack. China has taken a similar line, and has also assailed the American bombing.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>An inevitable price of the United States' and Britain's use of force in Iraq is that it arouses considerable unease around the world, especially if it is later judged to have failed.</p> <p>Although only Russia has publicly vented irritation at the United States' decision to punish President Saddam Hussein, many other governments, especially in the Middle East, have watched the attacks with consternation, either from uneasiness about any nation that would take on itself the role of global policeman, or from concern about local repercussions, or from unanswered questions about what the United States is trying to achieve.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics', 'biographical information']	<p>THAT would Freud have made of the way George Soros, the world's most famous hedge fund manager, describes the tension brought on by having made a fortune as a speculator and then having reinvented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist?</p> <p>''Sometimes I felt like a gigantic digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other,'' Mr. Soros writes earthily in the preface to his new book, ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism'' (Public Affairs, $26). ''But in fact a considerable amount of thought connected the two ends.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>For four long years, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko has pursued an unlikely obsession: to raise tiny Belarus from the shards of the sundered Soviet Union and remake it into a model socialist state.</p> <p>Lately, it seems he has succeeded all too well.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Clinton's decision to strike Iraq tonight without the customary round of consulting allies drew sharp criticism from Russia and France, the two countries most reluctant to use force against Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>While Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright talked to some 16 foreign ministers of the Security Council and European and Arab allies before the bombing began, her purpose was more to inform them of the American decision than to seek their counsel, officials said.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>The severed  heads of four kidnapping victims  identified as three Britons and a New Zealander -- were found today on the side of a road in Chechnya, the breakaway region on Russia's southern border that emerged undefeated from a brutal war two years ago only to be engulfed by a wave of kidnappings and crime.</p> <p>The gruesome killings heightened alarm and outrage about the volatile situation in the region, which spun out of Moscow's control long ago. Until now, local kidnappers have usually kept their hostages alive in hopes of receiving ransom money, which has become a major source of income in an economy devastated by Russia's 21-month war against Chechen secessionists.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pressed the Russian Foreign Minister today for a Russian commitment to limit cooperation with the Iranian missile program.</p> <p>An American official said Ms. Albright, who is here for a NATO meeting, had reminded Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov that the United States provided financial support to keep Russian scientists from going to work on foreign weapons programs and had urged the Russian Government to ''make a maximum effort'' to limit technology transfers.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>After 317 days in captivity in Chechnya, a French aid worker was recently freed by Russian commandos in a gunfight that killed three kidnappers.</p> <p>The ending could have been quite different for the worker, Vincent Cochetel, 37. Other foreigners have been kidnapped in what appears to have become a routine way to raise cash in the breakaway Caucasus republic. The heads of four foreign hostages were found this month in a sack on a roadside. Those kidnappers are reportedly demanding ransom for the bodies.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'biographical information']	<p>The Clinton Administration, under pressure to make some concession to other Security Council members after the Iraq bombing, may be willing to consider closing the file on nuclear inspections, diplomats and independent arms control experts said today.</p> <p>By the time the Security Council assembled this morning to begin what is expected to be weeks of assessing where the United Nations goes next on Iraq, it was apparent to diplomats that the United States would have to compromise on something if other arms inspections -- of biological, chemical and missile systems -- are to continue.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>The Presidents of Russia and Belarus said today that they intended to begin unifying their currencies and much of their economies next year, an action that would stop just short of a political merger that would again extend Russian territory to the border of Poland.</p> <p>Whether such a military or political union could occur later was left unclear. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, a fervent proponent of merging his nation into Russia, said he hoped that the two countries would enter the millennium as one.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Clinton Administration is urging its European allies to embark on a new initiative to combat weapons of mass destruction, as an example of the kinds of new threats a modernized, post-Soviet NATO must deal with in the next century, senior American and NATO-country officials say.</p> <p>In a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, called to set the agenda for the 50th anniversary NATO summit meeting to convene here in April, the Americans will propose a new NATO Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, commonly referred to as ''W.M.D.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Despite Moscow's anger over the bombing of Iraq, and the recall of its Ambassador from Washington, Russian officials' private conversations with Americans reflect a desire to take the edge off the acrimony, senior American officials said today.</p> <p>Russian fury has been easing from its peak on Wednesday, the Americans said, with the most positive conversation yet occurring this morning between Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>With foreign powers competing for influence in the soon-to-be-rich lands surrounding the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, potentially the richest of them, has made a startling offer. It wants the United States to open a military base there.</p> <p>The offer could give the United States its first permanent military presence on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Even if the base does not materialize, the offer suggests that Azerbaijan, where American oil companies have invested billions of dollars, is eager for a military partnership with the United States. But in addition to giving the United States greater influence in the Caspian region, any such partnership might draw the United States into alliances with undemocratic governments.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>It was near midnight seven years ago when a vast crowd gathered outside K.G.B. headquarters here as four cranes hoisted from its pedestal a statue of a hated man: Feliks Dzerzhinsky, founder of the secret police that helped keep the Soviet Union in fear for 74 years.</p> <p>Last month, Russia's Parliament voted to put the statue back.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Clinton Administration today announced a far-reaching plan to end the fighting in Kosovo that calls for NATO air strikes if the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, refuses to grant Kosovo autonomy.</p> <p>Talks between the two sides are expected to begin in Europe next week. If ethnic Albanian separatists who have been fighting for independence resist the plan, NATO could impose a blockade on the coast of Albania to cut off the flow of arms to the guerrillas.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russian leaders responded with silence today to a White House proposal to overhaul the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to permit the construction of defenses against missile attacks.</p> <p>That was no surprise. Russian strategists have long been deeply opposed to altering the treaty. To some here, the surprise was that the White House made the offer at all, as it is sure to anger legislators pondering the fate of a far weightier accord, known as Start 2, to reduce both nations' stocks of nuclear weapons.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Turkey may soon have a functioning Government after six weeks without one, but its new-found assertiveness in foreign policy is likely to continue no matter who emerges as the next Prime Minister.</p> <p>Once a bashful actor on the world stage, Turkey has begun flexing its muscles whenever it feels the need.</p>
['biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>France and Britain conferred this week on the next steps to take in Iraq, but French officials said on Friday that wide differences still separated them.</p> <p>France would like Britain and the United States to agree in the United Nations Security Council to lift the oil embargo against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein consents to a new system of international arms monitoring. The French proposal has met with little success with the allies so far and, as a high-ranking French official said on Friday, there is not yet any certainty that Mr. Hussein will agree to a permanent control system.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Markets and governments around the world operated under an unshakable assumption throughout the economic turmoil last year: if things really got bad, the United States would be there to engineer a bailout.</p> <p>After all, as everyone from President Clinton to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin kept declaring, the future of the United States was inextricably linked to the fate of the troubled emerging economies.</p>
['currency', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>The fall in value of the Russian ruble last August was responsible in part for toppling Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko and his reformist Cabinet, wrecking Russia's banking system and inflicting considerable damage to commerce. Traders ran into roadblocks in buying foreign goods on credit, consumers scrambled to pay inflated prices for items that quickly became scarce. And banks, including Bankers Trust, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, reported ruble-related losses.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin left his sickbed to deliver a surprisingly bullish year-end verdict on Russia's economy. ''Russia is on the up,'' he declared.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, in fact, is probably the only optimist. From international economists to the Kremlin's own specialists, the prognosis is decidedly grim.</p> <p>The chief question is not whether Russia will turn the corner this year. It is whether Russia will find some way to muddle through despite a weakening economy or whether the situation will tumble precipitously out of control.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'finances', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Administration said today that it was asking Russia to renegotiate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit a limited national system of missile defenses.</p> <p>The White House acted after concluding that the threat of a strike from a rogue state like North Korea justified building a limited number of ground-based interceptor missiles that could shoot down incoming missiles. The system is not designed to protect the nation from an all-out nuclear attack.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Clinton Administration announced economic penalties today against three Russian institutions that it contends are helping Iran and possibly other nations develop nuclear weapons and missiles. The sanctions, imposed by executive order, mean that all American exports to the institutions, and all imports from them, are banned.</p> <p>The punishment was levied against the Mendeleyev Chemical Technical University in Moscow, the Moscow Aviation Institute, and the Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power and Technology. In announcing the sanctions, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said Russia should develop an export-control system that is ''designed to work, and does.''</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'law and legislation']	<p>In his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, President Clinton will insist that the United States substantially increase its financial assistance to Russia to minimize the threat posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal, Administration officials say.</p> <p>''The President believes it's in the national security interest of the American people that we work with Russia and other former Soviet countries to reduce the risk that materials, technology and expertise for weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of rogue nations or terrorists,'' David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, said today.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>When President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced two months ago what they termed a ''precautionary'' $41.5 billion aid package for Brazil, they described it as the first test of a new strategy to help countries reform their economies before being overwhelmed by the tumultuous global market forces that have swept from Asia to Russia to Latin America.</p> <p>In return, the Brazilians said they would curb free-spending ways -- they signed an accord declaring that their Government was ''fully committed'' to maintaining the system for managing the value of its currency. Only by slowly decreasing the value of the real, the thinking went, could Brazil keep itself and the rest of Latin America from descending into a nasty recession.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia, which is opposing any revival of the present arms inspection system in Iraq, today gave the Security Council a detailed blueprint for a new monitoring apparatus having much less independence.</p> <p>The United States representative here quickly rejected the plan.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright embarks Sunday on a trip to a weakened but obstinate Russia, with little expectation on either side that much will improve in a relationship plagued by disagreement on everything from Russia's economic collapse to air strikes against Iraq.</p> <p>In contrast to the euphoria of the heady days when Russia was envisioned as a full member of a ''Group of Eight'' industrialized democracies, the hope today is to keep a dialogue alive, an Administration official said.</p>
['public opinion', 'biographical information']	<p>His boss is back in the hospital, leaving him with most of the work. His budget for 1999 is dismissed as unrealistic, and it doesn't even take into account $8 billion that Russia has already promised not to pay its creditors. The economy is sure to get worse before it gets better, and the International Monetary Fund is still playing hard to get.</p> <p>For Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia, now four months in office, the new year has yet to bring good news. President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest ailment, diagnosed as a bleeding ulcer, only confirms a trend that was already evident: Mr. Primakov, a former Foreign Minister, has had to assume more and more of the President's duties, being careful not to show any unseemly enthusiasm for the job.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Security Council, divided by radically differing Russian and American proposals for dealing with Iraq, began discussion today of a ''third way'' proposed by Canada.</p> <p>The Canadians are hoping to fill the void between what are basically hardened Russian and American policies with new information on which to base future talks on new programs for monitoring Iraqi weapons and insuring adequate supplies of necessary goods to Iraqi civilians.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'medicine and health']	<p>Some days Avilio Guia likes to come and sit outside the new Carlos III Market and watch the people coming and going from dollar-only shops.</p> <p>He was a foreman on the construction team that built the mall a year ago. Now, it is a world out of his reach. His Government salary is only 600 pesos a month, less than $30. He has no way to earn hard currency and the shops inside accept nothing else.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Behind the closed doors of the United Nations Security Council, three of America's major partners are closing fast on their goal: to give Saddam Hussein victory in the war he lost eight years ago.</p> <p>The victory would not just establish Iraqi dominance in the Mideast, it would threaten the pragmatic reality of the Western alliance and America's role in it. And in words I choose with unhappy care: It would bring into vivid danger the purpose and existence of the U.N.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Barely three weeks after doctors declared him fully recovered from pneumonia and exhaustion, President Boris N. Yeltsin was found to have an acute bleeding stomach ulcer and was sent to a Moscow hospital today.</p> <p>The ulcer was Mr. Yeltsin's third serious illness in three months, and it follows a year in which health problems sent him to the hospital twice and kept him away from his Kremlin office for months.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Richard Butler, the embattled chairman of the commission charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, said today that he did not expect to seek another term as chairman but that he would strongly resist any effort to oust him.</p> <p>In an interview today, Mr. Butler coupled his intention to leave when his contract expires in June with strong criticism of Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>I ran into the Russian reform party leader Grigory Yavlinsky in Europe two weeks ago and asked him a simple question: ''Grigory, when America wakes up from its impeachment nightmare, what kind of Russia will we find?''</p> <p>He thought about that for a moment and said: ''You will find a Russia that is even more of a threat to you than the Soviet Union. Frankly, it's more of a threat to its own people. That's what I care about. But it is also more of a threat to you.''</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals']	<p>Seven years ago, Nikolai Cherevatov, then a Moscow University student, told his parents that his search for religion had led him to Jehovah's Witnesses, one of the fastest-growing proselytizing religious groups in Russia.</p> <p>''They were very upset,'' said Mr. Cherevatov, now 31 and a rigorous  follower of the religious community that is now before a Moscow court,  accused of inciting religious discord and threatened with a ban on its activities.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>United in loss and grief, an extraordinary array of presidents, prime ministers and princes gathered here today to accompany King Hussein on his final journey, as his body was buried in a humble white shroud.</p> <p>The mourners included Jordan's allies and enemies and some who remain one another's bitter foes, including the leaders of Syria and Israel. That turnout paid tribute in death to a King who in life, during nearly a half-century's reign, sought to mend even the most rancorous of disputes.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'computers and the internet']	<p>The United States has urged Russia to set up a joint missile-warning center before the end of the year to reduce the risk that the year 2000 computer problem might touch off a false nuclear alert.</p> <p>The proposal was made in talks last week between American and Russian defense officials, a senior Pentagon official said today.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Kosovo's ethnic Albanians took the pressure off President Slobodan  Milosevic by failing to agree to terms at talks outside Paris, Serbian officials and analysts said today, allowing Mr. Milosevic to create at least temporary divisions within the West.</p> <p>Mr. Milosevic remains prepared to make a deal, these officials and analysts said, but he will want, in return, to ease his country's economic and diplomatic isolation.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A study to be issued today by the Government's own auditors is highly critical of a key part of the Clinton Administration's effort to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons by helping to employ scientists from the former Soviet Union on peaceful projects.</p> <p>The study of two Energy Department programs by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concludes that American aid may have instead supported scientists still working in Russia on projects related to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
['terrorism', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'biographical information']	<p>Enraged by the capture of the foremost Kurdish rebel leader, protesters stormed diplomatic posts throughout Europe and elsewhere today, taking hostages and setting fires -- and in some cities even setting themselves on fire.</p> <p>With what seemed like extraordinary coordination, Kurds in Paris, Moscow, London, Frankfurt, Milan, Bern and more than a dozen other cities as far away as Sydney went on rampages of rage and protest over the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party. Although there was no clear evidence that the protests were orchestrated, Kurds held rallies, seized consulates, battled the police and threatened mass suicides.</p>
['religion and churches', 'ethics']	<p>Russia's top prosecutor suddenly resigns, officially for health reasons, although no one believes that. A former Justice Minister, out of office for two years, is arrested on charges of fraud and embezzlement.</p> <p>Then the police confirmed tonight that they had found evidence of illegal wiretapping during a citywide raid of offices and apartments linked to Boris A. Berezovsky, Russia's best-known businessman and ace political intriguer. He is also the most public target of what seems to be Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov's opening shot in a crackdown against economic crime and corruption.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Nikita S. Mikhalkov, Russia's most celebrated living film director, has already won an Oscar for his 1995 movie, ''Burnt by the Sun.'' He has fame, fortune and, as many women fans would have it, is the epitome of Russian manhood.</p> <p>But the talk now in Moscow -- a capital skittish with economic crisis, winter gloom and an obviously ailing head of state -- is that Mr. Mikhalkov might even run for President.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'biographical information']	<p>Boris A. Berezovsky has always been the most brazen, the most quoted and the most visible of Russia's new tycoons -- all reasons why he also seemed to be the most influential.</p> <p>Today, the math whiz-auto dealer-financier extraordinaire -- reportedly one of the richest, and certainly one of the most reviled men in Russia -- also became the most overheard.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'elections']	<p>The citizens of this graceful but impoverished city have a message for the West: Hand over your money, or we'll shoot.</p> <p>Just a decade ago, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, Lviv was a prime supplier of Moscow's tanks, bombsights and military electronics. When the Soviet Union vanished, so did Lviv's weapons orders, scores of thousands of factory jobs -- and then, bit by bit, the city's hope for a capitalist future.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>A coalition of nuclear-weapons experts called on the Clinton Administration today to revive stalled arms-control negotiations with Russia by making a series of bold and, if necessary, unilateral gestures to reduce nuclear stockpiles and build confidence.</p> <p>In a report issued here, the Committee on Nuclear Policy, which represents a variety of arms-control organizations and research groups, said the Administration was losing the initiative by waiting indefinitely for the Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start II, before taking new steps to reduce nuclear weapons.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Fighting spread across southern Kosovo today and Richard C. Holbrooke, the American envoy, left for Washington empty-handed after his meetings here with the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>But Mr. Holbrooke first met with representatives of other nations trying to bring peace to Serbia, then handed over the negotiating to the Greek and Russian Foreign Ministers. The Greek Foreign Minister, George Papandreou, arrived today.</p>
['television']	<p>Six weeks ago, Russia's top prosecutor, Yuri I. Skuratov, handed in his resignation and disappeared from sight, causing a scandal.</p> <p>Today, as that scandal took on new and ominous dimensions, Mr. Skuratov returned to view, twice. The first time was in the upper house of Parliament, where he suddenly announced that he planned to stay in his job, in open defiance of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia is due in Belgrade today, with the stated purpose of stopping NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia and laying the groundwork for a peaceful settlement of the crisis.</p> <p>As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed to Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov when they talked by telephone yesterday, the precondition for a return to diplomacy is an end to the frenzied slaughter that Serbian soldiers, police officers and paramilitary gangs are carrying out against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. If that is Mr. Primakov's message to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia today, the mission may help. If not, it won't.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Alarmed by the prospects of a widening war in the Balkans, President Boris N. Yeltsin dispatched Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov today on a high-risk mission to Belgrade Tuesday to coax President Slobodan Milosevic back to the negotiating table.</p> <p>Russia will insist first on a halt to the NATO bombing, which top officials here again described as an barbaric act of aggression.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>NATO officials said today that Slobodan Milosevic's goal in Kosovo was to carve out a Serb-only enclave in the province that he could hold onto after the fighting had ended.</p> <p>''We have the impression that there is a campaign under way to ethnically re-engineer the inside of Kosovo, to achieve a solution more acceptable to him,'' said the chief spokesman for NATO, Jamie P. Shea.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>With their black uniforms and barely disguised swastikas, the followers of Aleksandr P. Barkashov's Russian National Unity party are hard to miss, which is one reason their march in Moscow a few weeks ago attracted so much attention.</p> <p>The marchers, shouting out ''Glory to Russia!'' with stiff-armed salutes, numbered no more than 200, hardly a show of strength in a city of 10 million. But for Mr. Barkashov, 45, a pony-tailed karate expert and veteran of an earlier extreme nationalist movement, just showing up was enough.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Russia vowed tonight to punish the separatist Chechnya region unless Chechen kidnappers quickly released a high-ranking Russian officer. The threat  represented the most serious deterioration in Russian-Chechen relations since a peace settlement was concluded more than two years ago.</p> <p>Russian officials declined to specify how they would respond to the kidnapping of Maj. Gen. Gennadi Shpigun, a senior Interior Ministry official. Sergei Stepashin, the Interior Minister, said tonight that Russia was planning a series of economic, political and ''operational'' measures. The aim was not just to free the kidnapped officer but also to punish the Chechens, said Mr. Stepashin, who was a hawk during the fierce  Chechen war.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin has delivered a stern warning to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, accusing him of being ''complacent'' about the  nation's economic course and threatening yet another Government shake-up.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's unusual public riposte was expressed through a senior aide, Oleg N. Sysuyev, the Deputy Chief of Staff.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>A Russian delegation met here today with the United States special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, before attempting to travel by road to neighboring Yugoslavia to present a peace plan to President Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>The three prominent liberal politicans from Moscow warned that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia had severely damaged Russia's relationship with the United States.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>A masked gunman tried to fire a grenade launcher at the United States Embassy today, igniting a gun battle that left the building pockmarked with bullet holes.</p> <p>While the embassy has been the scene of angry protests over NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia in recent days, the motive for today's attack was not clear. The gunman and at least one accomplice escaped without giving any indication of their purpose.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'war and revolution', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare']	<p>Serbia's latest offensive in Kosovo is leading some of Russia's top foreign policy specialists to question Moscow's longstanding support for Belgrade.</p> <p>With Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov set to leave on Tuesday for Washington, Russia's top priority is to wrest billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund, not argue over the Balkans.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'religion and churches', 'foreign aid']	<p>Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov promised a group of American Jews today that the Russian Government will combat a rising tide of anti-Semitism.</p> <p>Mr. Primakov provided the assurance in a meeting with representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a division of B'nai B'rith. The Kremlin has condemned anti-Semitism, but Mr. Primakov has previously said little about the problem, although he himself has Jewish family roots.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'elections', 'books and literature', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>I don't know about you, but I slept particularly well last Friday night, knowing that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had just joined NATO. What? You say you were too disturbed by the reports of the Clinton team's lackadaisical response to potential Chinese pilfering of U.S. nuclear secrets to sleep well? You say you had insomnia over the fact that our nuclear arms control regime with Russia is crumbling?</p> <p>Well, to you I say, ''Don't worry, be happy.'' I read in my own newspaper that the Clintonites are planning to bring Slovenia into NATO next, and if that doesn't make you sleep better, I can't help you. You must be one of those nuts who still think that the most important strategic issue facing the U.S. is all the nuclear weapons pointed at us from Russia.</p>
['ethics']	<p>The evidence is still flimsy, and the political motives are obvious, but Russia's chief prosecutor's office confirmed today that it was investigating corruption inside the Kremlin itself, aimed at members of President Boris N. Yeltsin's inner circle.</p> <p>Acting on orders from Yuri I. Skuratov, the general prosecutor who last week defied a Kremlin order to resign, investigators have seized documents from the offices of the presidential administration's powerful property management office, headed by Pavel P.

['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Azerbaijan has detained a Russian transport plane that was ferrying arms to Yugoslavia in violation of an international embargo, a senior Azerbaijani official said today.</p> <p>The official, Vafa Guluzade, chief foreign policy adviser to President Heydar Aliyev, said the transport plane was carrying six MIG jet fighters for the Yugoslav military.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Just after 1 P.M. today, an angry Russian Prime Minister, en route to Washington for some of the most important talks of his short tenure, ordered his pilot to turn his Ilyushin airliner around and return to Moscow.</p> <p>Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov was a few hundred miles northeast of Newfoundland when he received a satellite telephone call from Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore grimly informed him that a diplomatic effort had failed and that the United States and NATO were preparing to deliver a barrage of air and missile strikes against Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia.</p>
['public opinion', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>If NATO's diplomats get their way, next month's 50th birthday party in Washington will be replete with post-cold-war symbolism, featuring top Russian officials in its large cast to demonstrate just how well the old enemies now work side by side.</p> <p>There is just one small problem: Russia has not yet decided whether it wants the part.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia introduced a Security Council resolution today demanding an immediate end to NATO's  air strikes against Yugoslavia, denouncing them as a ''threat to international peace'' and a ''flagrant violation'' of both the United Nations Charter and Yugoslav sovereignty.</p> <p>The resolution, which faces almost certain defeat when the  Council considers it on Friday, was introduced by Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's representative to the United Nations. A spokesman for Mr. Lavrov said the measure was intended to underline Russia's view that military action is illegal and destabilizing.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>As Yugoslavia's Ambassador to Russia, the elder brother of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has done his best to drum up support for Yugoslavia in Moscow.</p> <p>So far, though, Borislav Milosevic  does not have much to show for it.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>In his long and somewhat mysterious political career, Yevgeny M. Primakov has dealt with the United States in many guises: reform Communist, intelligence chief and an occasionally quarrelsome Foreign Minister.</p> <p>But now, as Prime Minister and effective leader of the Russian Government under an erratic, ailing and jealous President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Primakov is facing one of his most important challenges.</p>
['ethics']	<p>As the focus of Russia's latest political scandal shifted from corruption to sex, President Boris N. Yeltsin appointed a commission today to investigate the making and distribution of a videotape that showed the Prosecutor General in bed naked with two young women.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, who was discharged today from a hospital after three weeks, held a morning meeting with the embattled official, Yuri I. Skuratov, who on Wednesday mounted a challenge to Mr. Yeltsin by refusing to keep a promise to resign.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Representative Tom Lantos, born a Hungarian, long since naturalized as an American, could scarcely contain his joy as he flew west this morning for the ceremony here marking the accession of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p> <p>''After a thousand years of desperate craving to be part of the West, today it's official -- we're in, we get the imprimatur of NATO,'' the silver-haired, 71-year-old California Democrat said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia has offered to curtail nuclear cooperation with Iran if Washington ends sanctions against two leading Russian nuclear research centers, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister says.</p> <p>The proposal comes as Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov prepares for critical talks in Washington next week on security issues and Russian appeals for billions of dollars in credits from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Stung by NATO's decision to carry out air strikes against Yugoslavia, Russia tonight suspended cooperation with the Western alliance and denounced the attack as an act of brazen aggression.</p> <p>Behind the words, however, was a tempering factor: Russia still needs billions of dollars in Western loans.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The key to raising the price of oil, OPEC has decided, is found more in politics than economics.</p> <p>After a decade of internecine fighting over which country should produce how much oil, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut through a lot of haggling here on Tuesday to reach a production-cutting accord that was underpinned by the strength of newly arrived at political alliances.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'biographical information', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The leader of the breakaway region of Chechnya survived an assassination attempt today when a bomb exploded near his motorcade in Grozny, the regional capital.</p> <p>Several people were wounded in the blast in central Grozny, including some of the bodyguards in the motorcade. But Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the separatist region in the Caucasus area of southern Russia, was unhurt.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Caught up in the belligerent hysteria that has filled the sidewalks in front of the American Embassy here for the last three days, Aleksei Yermakov could not have been happier.</p> <p>''Look around, there are only young people,'' said Mr. Yermakov, a 40-year-old interpreter, grinning at the black-jacketed youths shouting obscenities and throwing eggs, beer and paint at the embassy's mustard yellow walls. ''Isn't it wonderful?''</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin told Russian political leaders today that the country ''will not allow itself to be drawn into military conflict'' in Yugoslavia.</p> <p>The President's words came at the start of his annual speech to lawmakers and Cabinet members on the state of the nation. He presented Russia as a country at a critical and historic juncture, in danger of being relegated to a second rank of nations if it failed to overcome its political divisions and economic weaknesses.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'religion and churches', 'immigration and refugees']	<p>Like many of Russia's Jews, Anatoly Vugman would like to stay in Russia. But since the financial crisis hit last August, the 20-year-old student has begun to hedge his bets by attending evening Hebrew classes.</p> <p>Mr. Vugman has plenty of company. With the economy distressed and political extremists making anti-Semitic tirades, enrollment in Hebrew classes here has tripled in the last year.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia responded today to NATO's decision to impose an oil embargo on Yugoslavia, saying Russia would continue to ship oil there ''in keeping with our international commitments.''</p> <p>Mr. Ivanov's statement came against a backdrop of growing tensions between Russia and the Western alliance over the Yugoslavia bombing campaign.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>President Clinton demonstrated today just how delicate American and Russian relations are: He encouraged Russia to act as a mediator in the Kosovo conflict, even as he backed NATO's determination to choke off oil supplies to Yugoslavia -- a move that could stoke a confrontation with Russia.</p> <p>Russia has been absent from the NATO summit meeting here, boycotting the gathering because it profoundly objects to the NATO bombing of its Slavic cousins in Serbia. But the allies are turning to Russia to help broker a peace with the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and would welcome the contribution of Russian troops to any international security force that might move in to protect Kosovo Albanians.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense', 'news and news media']	<p>Since the cold war ended, no other event has so divided the West and Russia as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The chasm is so deep that even words have taken on opposite meanings. While Americans and Europeans talk about the ''genocide'' of Kosovo Albanians by Serbs, many Russians talk about the ''genocide'' of Serbs by American bombs.</p> <p>Here, the chief villains are President Clinton and NATO, variously described as fascists and bullies. President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, widely identified in the United States and Europe as the man responsible for a vicious campaign of ''ethnic cleansing,'' is seen by many here as a defiant patriot, defending the sovereignty of a country attacked by foreign aggressors.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>With the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia so far unable to deter the atrocities in Kosovo, and the United States unwilling to commit ground troops, the idea of arming the Kosovo guerrillas has garnered support from a number of politicians and former policymakers.</p> <p>The Kosovo Liberation Army offers ''a credible, capable and willing alternative to the deployment of Americans,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Thursday.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>No, President Boris N. Yeltsin did not order Russian nuclear missiles to be targeted at NATO countries taking part in the bombing of Yugoslavia. Nor did he formally endorse the joining together of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia in a geographically awkward Slavic union.</p> <p>But at a meeting today with Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist who is the Speaker of the Russian Parliament's lower house, he unmistakably warned the West not to push Russia into another war in the Balkans.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States has quietly warned Russia against providing military intelligence or assistance to Yugoslavia, senior Western officials said today.</p> <p>The confidential warning follows bitter complaints from Moscow about NATO's air strikes and the Kremlin's decision to dispatch a Russian spy ship toward the Adriatic, where the American aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and other alliance ships have been participating in the air campaign against Yugoslavia.</p>
['ethics']	<p>The upper house of Parliament rejected both lobbying and a personal plea from President Boris N. Yeltsin today and voted lopsidedly, for the second time, to retain a prosecutor investigating corruption at the heart of the Kremlin.</p> <p>The 79-to-61 vote was a serious setback for Mr. Yeltsin, who has been striving to rebuild both the illusion and the reality of political clout in order to resist impeachment and a steady erosion of his authority.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A  senior Yugoslav Government official, the second this week, spoke optimistically today about the possibility of a negotiated settlement to the war over Kosovo.</p> <p>''I believe that this will be the week in which the basic outline of an agreement on Kosovo can be firmed up,'' Goran Matic said today.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Senior American and Russian officials met today to discuss competing notions of how Kosovo could be resettled and administered once hostilities end, as Moscow moved increasingly into a role as mediator in the lengthening Balkan conflict.</p> <p>Before leaving Moscow for Germany, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott gave a positive assessment of his meetings with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former Prime Minister who has been appointed Russia's special envoy for Kosovo.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia agreed in a telephone conversation today to work closely together in the search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo. They spoke as leaders of NATO concluded a summit meeting with pledges to intensify their air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>White House officials said Mr. Yeltsin initiated the call and asked Mr. Clinton to place the next one after doing ''some thinking.''</p>
['news and news media']	<p>The most liberal member of the Yugoslav Government has sharply attacked the use of Serbian wartime patriotism for ideological and political ends, throwing down an indirect challenge to President Slobodan Milosevic and his nationalist and leftist allies, including Mr. Milosevic's wife.</p> <p>In two extraordinary statements during the last two days, the Deputy Prime Minister of Yugoslavia, Vuk Draskovic, has become the only official voice to condemn both the slaying on Sunday of an opposition publisher, Slavko Curuvija, and the proposals for Yugoslavia to form an alliance with Russia and Belarus.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>After months of decline, the Russian economy is beginning to show some stability, according to a monthly report issued today by an independent research organization and the Government.</p> <p>The April issue of the report, ''Russian Economic Trends,'' noted small increases in consumer spending and industrial production in February and a falling inflation rate last month.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Russian Foreign Minister said today that Moscow remained opposed to an international security force in Kosovo as part of a peace plan without the approval of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</p> <p>This fundamental difference between Russia and the United States appeared to blunt any prospect that real progress would be made soon toward a diplomatic solution.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration has approached Moscow to serve as a go-between with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia in a new attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Kosovo.</p> <p>Vice President Al Gore called Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia by telephone and spoke to him for 40 minutes today, asking his help in getting the Yugoslav leader to take steps that would lead to a diplomatic solution, Mr. Gore's office said.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>In our last episode, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reluctantly began to expound on his foreign-policy mindset. To continue:</p> <p>On our involvement in Kosovo: ''NATO has to be confident in its capacity to help preserve the peace in Europe. So I think it is in America's strategic interest in this case, that once we are in the position we got into, that Mr. Milosevic be taught a lesson.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'espionage']	<p>A senior intelligence official at the Energy Department said today that his superiors and other Clinton Administration officials repeatedly downplayed or dismissed evidence that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from a Government weapons laboratory.</p> <p>The official, Notra Trulock, who was in charge of analyzing the case for the Energy Department, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that in some instances, senior officials made it clear to him that information about the suspected espionage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory would harm the credibility of Government laboratories, hurt their efforts to work with scientists in China and Russia, and might be used by Congress to attack President Clinton's China policies.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'espionage']	<p>A senator intelligence official at the Energy Department said today that his superiors and other Clinton Administration officials repeatedly downplayed or dismissed evidence that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from a Government weapons laboratory.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'biographical information']	<p>Russian parliamentary leaders voted today to delay indefinitely a planned vote on the impeachment of President Boris N. Yeltsin, stepping back from another showdown between the Kremlin and the Parliament.</p> <p>But the postponement was only half a victory for Mr. Yeltsin, who recently said that he would prefer to have the issue removed from the political agenda once and for all, preferably by its defeat in the opposition-dominated lower house of Parliament.</p>
['elections']	<p>Talk about strange bedfellows . . .</p> <p>The game of footsie that Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his Foreign Minister, Ariel Sharon, have been playing lately with Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's Prime Minister, surely takes the cake.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The International Monetary Fund warned today that global economic growth could slow in 1999 and perhaps into 2000, hurt by weakness in Russia, Asia, Brazil and some regions of Europe, notably those ravaged by the Kosovo conflict.</p> <p>The group's latest world economic outlook said that ''several hurdles could prevent global growth from returning to potential within two or three years.''</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'immigration and refugees', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>With NATO bombing of Serbia now in its 18th day, a senior allied diplomat said here today that the alliance was prepared to continue air attacks ''for many more weeks'' but that the idea of using ground troops was not being seriously discussed.</p> <p>''There's agreement in the alliance that the air campaign is having its effect, but that there's a lot more time left before it has run its course,'' the official said. ''The issue of ground troops is not being debated in a formal or serious way within the alliance.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>The International Monetary Fund announced a preliminary agreement tonight to lend Russia $4.5 billion over the next 18 months, the first resumption of loans since the country defaulted on its debts and devalued its currency last summer.</p> <p>But in a highly unusual element of the deal that was not mentioned in tonight's announcement, the money will never actually be sent to Moscow. Instead, at the insistence of the United States Treasury and some European nations, the loans will essentially be transferred from one of the I.M.F.'s accounts to another -- allowing Russia to avoid default on money it owes the lending agency this year and next.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Five weeks into the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the Clinton Administration is faced with three choices in the Kosovo war, all disagreeable: an open-ended air campaign, the dispatch of ground troops, or compromise in a diplomatic solution.</p> <p>None of the options offers a quick solution. President Clinton suggested today that bombing could last into the summer; preparing for an armed invasion could take months, and a negotiated resolution would have to span a yawning chasm between NATO and President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslav.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The German Government is pressing a Western diplomatic initiative aimed at isolating the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, rather than dealing with him. The strategy is driven by the conviction that he will almost certainly be indicted by the international war crimes tribunal.</p> <p>Germany, whose ties to Russia are close, was at the center of diplomatic activity today directed chiefly at securing Moscow's support for NATO's objectives in Kosovo, and thus reducing Mr. Milosevic's room to maneuver, Western officials said. No sign emerged today of any immediate breakthrough in the discussions that began on Tuesday with a visit to Moscow by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, but Western officials held out hope that Russia, Mr. Milosevic's chief if not enthusiastic supporter, might shift its position.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Slobodan Milosevic spent nine hours today with a Russian peace envoy but appeared to give very little ground.</p> <p>The Russian envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, left Belgrade late tonight saying that Mr. Milosevic had agreed to an ''international presence in Kosovo under United Nations auspices,'' to implement any political settlement.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Last time, they hung white sheets from their windows. That was in 1991 when the United States started lobbing cruise missiles into Baghdad. But it was not Iraqis who were waving the traditional flag of surrender -- it was peace-minded Germans. Never mind that they were not the targets. They wanted to demonstrate their moral superiority in the face of American ''cowboy imperialism.''</p> <p>These last few days, we have seen no such displays of righteousness in Europe. Indeed, as the pounding of Yugoslavia goes into its second week, the most intriguing news from Europe is that the dogs of peace have not been barking in the night.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin fired off another peace offensive today, even as a Russian military reconnaissance ship was heading into the Mediterranean in a open demonstration of Moscow's anti-NATO stance in the Yugoslavia conflict.</p> <p>Appearing today on national television, Mr. Yeltsin called for an emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the world's seven leading industrial powers, plus Russia, to seek a political settlement in the Balkans.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>NATO has rejected Slobodan Milosevic's latest move, a unilateral cease-fire, as insufficient for the bombing to stop, but again it is the Yugoslav President who is creating the facts to which the West is responding.</p> <p>And Mr. Milosevic appears to be constructing a new form of reality in Kosovo that will be harder for the Washington and NATO to dismiss out of hand.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration was right to reject Slobodan Milosevic's cease-fire proposal -- entering into negotiations now with Serbia, which has largely achieved its military goals in Kosovo before NATO has achieved much of anything, would be an admission of defeat.</p> <p>So why, then, has Vice President Al Gore called on Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia at this moment to work on an agreement with the Serb dictator? Playing the Russian card now legitimates Mr. Milosevic's horrendous actions in Kosovo and exposes the weakness of the NATO alliance.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A Russian-led peace initiative for Kosovo appeared to make little headway today, with Moscow and the West divided over the composition of any international force in Kosovo and the Yugoslav Government in defiant mood.</p> <p>Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's Balkan envoy, held talks in Bonn with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, and declared afterward, ''There's progress, but no breakthrough.''</p>
['medicine and health', 'accidents and safety', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'books and literature']	<p>The most senior defector from the Soviet germ warfare program says in a new book that Soviet officials concluded that China had suffered a serious accident at one of its secret plants for developing biological weapons, causing two major epidemics.</p> <p>The book also reports that Soviet researchers tried to turn H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, into a weapon and that even as the last Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pursued peace openings with the West, he ordered a vast expansion of the deadly effort to turn germs and viruses into weapons of mass destruction.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Last week the West got a lesson in why we can't live with Boris Yeltsin and why we dare not live without him.</p> <p>Can't live without him, you ask? Why? Well, it is often remarked that the fate of Western world economies depends on the health of two men, Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan. That is a wild overstatement. But as long as we're overstating, I would add another name: Boris Yeltsin.</p>
['public opinion', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia may or may not free the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but a thousand miles away, it has already had a profoundly liberating effect. After eight long-suffering years, it is once again acceptable -- even de rigueur -- for Russians to dislike Americans.</p> <p>Enough Russians have embraced animosity, and with such sudden fervor, that some experts here say it threatens to become the guiding force in a relationship with little else going for it.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>A Russian relief convoy headed for Yugoslavia was stopped by Hungarian authorities today after they determined that it was carrying fuel and equipment that could be used by Belgrade's military, NATO officials said.</p> <p>The incident, which occurred as the convoy was trying to cross into Hungary from Ukraine, is the latest irritant in the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Russia and the Western alliance.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'public opinion', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, on her first visit to NATO headquarters since the bombing began, arrived here tonight for a gathering of foreign ministers intended to show that the 19 members of the alliance are unified behind the air strikes against the Belgrade Government.</p> <p>Anxious to counter the assertions of Yugoslav leaders that NATO will soon weary of the air campaign over Serbia, officials said the alliance would meet on Monday to reaffirm its demands on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, including the withdrawal of his troops from Kosovo and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>There cannot be security and stability in the world without Russia.</p> <p>NATO intensifies its bombing of Serbia to the cheers of a fair portion of the Western political and intellectual elite. The bombing has rallied Serbs behind their dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, who is using the air strikes as a cover and pretext for mass expulsions, massacres and hostage taking. As NATO bombing continues, outrages against the Kosovars seem certain to continue. The weapons used against the Kosovars are not easily countered from the air.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'demonstrations and riots', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton called President Boris N. Yeltsin today to press for Russian participation in a political resolution in Kosovo that would involve Russian troops in an international security force there, White House officials said.</p> <p>The conversation, the first between the two leaders since the NATO air assaults began on March 24, had a sense of urgency, reflecting a perception that the longer the bombing dragged on, the more difficult a political outcome involving the Russians would become, according to an official who listened to the 45-minute conversation.</p>
['treaties', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The United States and other industrial countries may find it easier and cheaper than expected to comply with a proposed treaty to fight global warming, thanks largely to reduced fuel consumption in Russia, the Government's energy-forecasting agency said today.</p> <p>Because the agreement on global warming allows international trading of pollution credits as a way to control emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like those that come from burning fossil fuels, more of the cuts that the treaty seeks may come from the former Soviet Union and less from the United States, the Energy Information Administration said in its annual long-range forecast.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia announced today that it is sending a military reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean to monitor the conflict in Yugoslavia, a move criticized by the United States State Department as unhelpful as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia intensifies.</p> <p>At a news conference today, Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev confirmed that Russia had notified Turkey of plans to dispatch seven vessels from its Black Sea Fleet through the Bosporus in two flotillas this month.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As Serbia tried to clean up today after NATO's heaviest bombing raids so far, Serbian television once again gave prominence to images of a moderate ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, showing him in meetings with a senior Yugoslav official and the Russian Ambassador.</p> <p>State television said that Mr. Rugova, who is living in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, under what Serbian authorities describe as police protection, met there today with the Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, Nikola Sainovic, and the Russian Ambassador to Belgrade, Yuri Kotov. The men were shown in a living room with unidentified journalists and photographers present.</p> <p>Mr. Rugova and Mr. Sainovic, a television announcer said, called for an end to the bombing in Kosovo and agreed to work for a peaceful negotiated solution, with the safe return of all refugees. Mr. Rugova, who has always favored a non-violent path to Kosovo's self-rule and, ultimately, independence, was quoted as saying he was ''prepared to continue work here so everyone can see I'm still in Kosovo and trying.''</p> <p>Mr. Rugova was also said to have confirmed that he had met last week with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevicin a session shown on Yugoslav television. One NATO official has questioned the authenticity of the videotape, and Belgrade television said that Mr. Rugova's reported statement today ''has caught NATO in a lie and revealed the propaganda war waged against our country.''</p> <p>But in an intriguing follow-up, the television also quoted Mr. Rugova as saying he would like to go abroad.</p> <p>''I am interested in going to Skopje and other countries,'' the announcer quoted him as saying, ''because I am here without my associates, and in Pristina I cannot contribute to the solution of the problem.'' Skopje is the capital of Macedonia.</p> <p>As usual, there was no audio accompanying the video footage, and no way to verify that Mr. Rugova had said any of the words attributed to him. NATO has said that Mr. Rugova is under house arrest; that he has not called for an end to the bombing, but for an end to violence in general; and that footage of his meeting with Mr. Milosevic was actually two years old.</p> <p>The official news agency Tanjug, discussing Mr. Rugova's meeting today, said: ''Rugova himself used the occasion to reject Sunday's statement of NATO spokesman Jamie Shea that he had not met President Slobodan Milosevic, and that the pictures taken on April 1 could be two years old.''</p> <p>Mr. Kotov, Tanjug continued, confirmed that Mr. Rugova ''is safe and alive, that he is free to move.''</p> <p>Efforts this evening to reach the Russian Embassy for comment were unsuccessful. Mr. Shea said in Brussels: ''I think we are going to have to wait until the end of the this conflict in Kosovo to learn all of the facts about Rugova, and therefore I probably should reserve judgment.''</p> <p>Western officials are concerned that Mr. Milosevic will suddenly announce a political deal with Mr. Rugova for substantial political autonomy for Kosovo, much along the lines of a Western-drafted solution that Mr. Rugova signed in France, but without a role for the Kosovo Liberation Army or NATO peacekeepers.</p> <p>Mr. Rugova has lost popularity and credibility with the fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but he  has retained significant support among ordinary ethnic Albanians. If he is a willing participant in a deal with Mr. Milosevic, many Albanians will regard him as a traitor, but others may welcome a chance to return home in peace.</p> <p>Senior Yugoslav officials have said privately that Mr. Milosevic still believes an internal political solution is possible for Kosovo, while other officials who have his ear are pressing for a form of partition that would keep the northern half of the province for Serbia and effectively cede the rest.</p> <p>But NATO is unlikely to accept either option.</p> <p>In widespread bombing early this morning, NATO struck at military targets and civilian infrastructure that the military could conceivably use for resupply. Allied forces destroyed the empty Yugoslav Air Force headquarters in Zemun, a municipality of Belgrade, and damaged  surrounding buildings. In Nis, 125 miles south, the headquarters of the 3d Army was demolished, along with an army barracks.</p> <p>Tonight, at about 9:30, Nis was hit again by ''six or seven cruise missiles,'' television reported. The nearby town of Aleksinac was also struck tonight, as was Novi Sad.</p> <p>As usual, no figures for military casualties were released.</p> <p>But many Government buildings are empty, and even state television, expecting to be bombed, is said to have moved to hardened bunkers.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>As an American envoy arrived here for talks on Kosovo, Russia's Foreign Minister said today that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was prepared to make concessions, but that NATO would also have to bend if the conflict was to be brought to an end.</p> <p>The remarks by the Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, came a day after President Boris N. Yeltsin telephoned President Clinton about Kosovo, and coincided with the arrival of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to pursue the possibilities of Russian mediation.</p>
['reform and reorganization', 'biographical information']	<p>Just a week ago, things were looking dire for President Boris N. Yeltsin. The Communist opposition had set a date for his impeachment. A fast-moving corruption inquiry was knocking on the gates of the Kremlin itself. NATO bombs over Yugoslavia threatened to damage not only Russia's relations with the West, but also the tenets of the country's fragile democracy.</p> <p>It was then that Mr. Yeltsin, always at his best when things couldn't be worse, returned to the fray. Back in the Kremlin after a long convalescence, the 68-year-old President held a series of meetings, rattled a few sabers, floated a few rumors and dropped a few hints, all intended to prove once again that for all his physical and political weaknesses he is still boss.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Joining in the search for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo, leaders of 15 European Union countries presented a plan today under which the province would be placed under temporary international European administration if President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces and allowed hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to return.</p> <p>American officials gave the European initiative, and a more detailed  one made public separately by Germany today, little chance of being accepted by Belgrade. NATO reiterated that it would continue bombing  in Yugoslavia until Mr. Milosevic withdrew all police and military units from Kosovo and let the ethnic Albanian population go back home.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Officials said today that Belgrade has agreed to let a United Nations mission visit Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, to assess relief needs, and the leader of an advance team representing several agencies left immediately for Belgrade.</p> <p>Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, announced that the trip was on after Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's representative here, delivered a letter welcoming the mission and assuring that Belgrade would facilitate the trip.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration, anxious to find a political solution to the Kosovo conflict as soon as possible, managed to get the Russians on its side today.</p> <p>In so doing, Washington and the allies, calculating that isolating President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was critical to setting the stage for negotiations, finessed several of their key demands and made it clear that there was room to maneuver on the composition of an international security force.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The West and Russia agreed for the first time today on the need for an international military presence in Kosovo to keep any eventual peace. But the composition of such a force and conditions for its deployment remained in dispute.</p> <p>An agreement reached here today by Foreign Ministers from the Group of Seven richest nations and Russia was a decisive step away from the specter of a wider conflict between Washington and Moscow over the Balkans.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's foreign-policy aides greeted the new framework for peace in Kosovo with a hint of pleasure at their return to the diplomatic spotlight and a determination that the country not appear to be merely a tool of the West.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's domestic advisers could not help but regard it as a small but significant victory for the President, who has struggled to control Russia's policy on Yugoslavia in the face of ever more militant -- and popular -- anti-Western oratory by Communist and nationalist forces.</p>
['currency', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>EURO UP FURTHER.  The euro rose for a third day as Russia agreed on the need for an international military presence in Kosovo, increasing speculation on a peace agreement. In New York, the euro rose to $1.0802 from $1.0741.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his Cabinet may deepen Russia's economic troubles by jeopardizing a badly needed loan-refinancing program from the International Monetary Fund and negotiations with other foreign creditors.</p> <p>This year, Russia was supposed to repay the I.M.F. about $4 billion and sovereign lenders and commercial banks about $17 billion. But after the economy collapsed last summer, Russia effectively defaulted on much of its foreign debt. Consequently, the Cabinet of the now-ousted Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, and the I.M.F. had spent the last few months developing an economic program and tied it to a critical refinancing agreement, announced in Washington late last month. The I.M.F. deal, in turn, gave Russia the credibility to renegotiate its debts with other creditors.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said here today that Germany was counting on a diplomatic outcome to the war in Kosovo, with the backing of Russia, in the next several weeks.</p> <p>Echoing strong statements by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, Mr. Fischer stressed that Germany opposed NATO forces entering Kosovo unless a settlement was first reached with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Finance Minister Mikhail M. Zadornov, an advocate of tough fiscal policies, will take charge of Russia's economic policy, Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin said today.</p> <p>Mr. Zadornov's promotion to the rank of First Deputy Prime Minister was one of the few surprises in a series of Cabinet appointments announced today by Mr. Stepashin, Russia's new Prime Minister, as he returned to Moscow after meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin at the Black Sea resort of Sochi.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Negotiations toward a political settlement over Serbia seemed to inch forward today when the Russian mediator, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met outside Moscow with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland.</p> <p>But at the same time, Russia registered its unhappiness with NATO by breaking off its military contacts with the alliance.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Russia's Acting Prime Minister told Parliament today that he would demand a vote of confidence in his new Government if the lawmakers refused to enact economic reforms on which Western lenders have conditioned billions of dollars in new loans.</p> <p>Sergei V. Stepashin, President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister, issued the pledge as he met with major parties in the Communist-led lower house of Parliament, which will vote on Wednesday on his nomination.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Reflecting frustration over his organization's marginalization in Kosovo, Secretary General Kofi Annan criticized the United States today for taking military action without Security Council blessing and China and Russia for having ignored the ethnic purging that led to NATO's bombing.</p> <p>In a speech at The Hague commemorating the centenary of the first International Peace Conference, Mr. Annan did not identify those Security Council members by name, but he warned that the inability of the 15-member Council to achieve consensus on Kosovo and other critical issues threatened both the United Nations and international peace.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Under increasing public pressure to resolve the conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton said today that he would not rule out the use of ground troops but that he was hopeful that diplomatic efforts under way with the Russians would be successful.</p> <p>''I and everyone else has always said that we intend to see our objectives achieved and that we have not and will not take any option off the table,'' Mr. Clinton told reporters at the White House when asked if he was reconsidering using ground troops to expel Serbian forces from Kosovo.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'credit', 'finances', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Ever the gambler, President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly fired Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov today, pushing Russia to the brink of a new political crisis.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin's latest Government shake-up, his third in 15 months, comes as the Russian Parliament opens what promises to be a stormy debate on his impeachment on Thursday, with the outcome of the vote, scheduled for Saturday, increasingly uncertain.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'elections']	<p>There is a pointed joke making the rounds in Israel:</p> <p>Why don't campaign commercials have subtitles in Amharic, the language of the Ethiopian immigrants here?</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Sergei Vadimovich Stepashin, President Boris N. Yeltsin's fourth choice as Prime Minister in less than a year, is best known loyalty to his boss. But that description does not do him justice.</p> <p>Mr. Stepashin has made an entire career in the Russian internal security apparatus. At one point or another, he has run Mr. Yeltsin's counterintelligence bureau, directed the Federal Security Service, which was the domestic successor to the K.G.B., and helped carry out the President's  disastrous war against rebels in the Chechnya region of Russia.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The turmoil in Russia today appeared to represent another impediment to the  Clinton Administration's hopes of finding a diplomatic end to the war in Kosovo.</p> <p>After dismissing his Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin threatened to withdraw from negotiations on Kosovo, saying that Moscow's proposals were being repeatedly ignored.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Encircled by leftist opponents and reduced almost to a cipher in opinion polls, clearly ill and on the brink of impeachment, Boris N. Yeltsin rose today to dismiss a Government he had never embraced and to try once again to position himself as Russia's savior.</p> <p>But after eight years of such dramatic dismissals, the question this time was: Who is Mr. Yeltsin trying to save, democratic Russia, or himself?</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information', 'immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Clinton held an extended discussion today with the Russian special envoy for the Balkans. But the White House remained pessimistic about the prospect of a deal anytime soon to end the Kosovo conflict.</p> <p>White House officials expressed gratitude for Russian efforts to broker a peace, but said the bombing of Yugoslavia would continue unabated until President Slobodan Milosevic had bent to allied demands.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>After more than 50 days of air raids and with his troops still entrenched in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic is prepared for a settlement, so long as the process can be portrayed as negotiation and not capitulation, Yugoslav officials and analysts say.</p> <p>There is a consensus that Mr. Milosevic has the political room to maneuver over Kosovo and to redefine almost any negotiated outcome as a victory to preserve his own grip on power.</p>
['biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States and Uzbekistan have quietly negotiated and are expected to sign a bilateral agreement today to provide American aid in dismantling and decontaminating one of the former Soviet Union's largest chemical weapons testing facilities, according to Defense Department and Uzbek officials.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Pentagon informed Congress that it intends to spend up to $6 million under its Cooperative Threat Reduction program to demilitarize the so-called Chemical Research Institute, in Nukus, Uzbekistan. Soviet defectors and American officials say the Nukus plant was the major research and testing site for a new class of secret, highly lethal chemical weapons called ''Novichok,'' which in Russian means ''new guy.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration announced today that the United States would press its allies to move quickly to deploy what was described as a peacekeeping force totaling 50,000 troops on the borders of Kosovo.</p> <p>After recent days of public debate and private planning, NATO is now likely to take up the issue as early as next week. The forces are intended to be used to help return the Kosovar Albanian refugees and to police any agreement reached with the Serbs.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today condemned the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as ''yet another flagrant violation of international law'' by NATO leaders and called on them to end their military action in Yugoslavia immediately.</p> <p>''This is a blatant outrage, and there can be no justification for it,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in a statement released by the Kremlin.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration struggled today to prevent the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade from either hobbling NATO's air campaign or stifling the nascent diplomatic search for a way to end the war over Kosovo.</p> <p>The White House said the American Ambassador in Beijing, James Sasser, had apologized to the Chinese Government and would continue to provide Chinese officials with information on how the accident happened.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>By dispatching his special envoy to Washington for talks on ending the Yugoslav conflict, President Boris N. Yeltsin has put Russia at the center of international diplomacy, reviving relations with Washington and NATO. Perhaps more to the point for Mr. Yeltsin, it also plays well at home.</p> <p>The move has quieted the hard-line critics who have lamented Moscow's dwindling influence, and has even enabled the President to settle a few scores with some of his political rivals.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>Fresh from concluding a vital debt refinancing agreement with the International Monetary Fund, top Russian ministers said today that foreign creditors were close to agreeing on deferred repayment of the country's Soviet-era loans.</p> <p>At the same time, the officials played down the political disputes that the I.M.F. agreement could cause within the Russian Parliament and the Government. The I.M.F.'s terms commit the Russians to making painful economic changes.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia insisted in an interview released here today that Yugoslavs were ''willing to die'' to defend what he called their right to Kosovo, but at the same time outlined what he described as a six-point plan for settlement of the war.</p> <p>In a rare insight into his thinking, Mr. Milosevic rejected the idea of a foreign military force in Kosovo that NATO has demanded, but said the United Nations ''can have a huge presence if it wishes.'' He said these United Nations peacekeepers could bear sidearms for self-defense and include troops from non-NATO nations.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A Russian envoy said tonight that he had made some progress toward a peace settlement after another six hours of talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, but NATO officials were dismissive.</p> <p>The Russian negotiator, former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, told Russian reporters that he had made ''solid progress'' in his second meeting with Mr. Milosevic in just over a week.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration today played down the divisions among its NATO allies over the air war against Yugoslavia, in what appeared to be a conscious effort not to accentuate those differences as delicate talks for a peace settlement were under way.</p> <p>The latest disagreement among allies -- Germany's dismissal of British support for the use of ground troops -- erupted as the Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, presented the allies' demands on ending the war to the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, in Belgrade. But behind the scenes, Cabinet members and even the President were on the telephone trying to repair the breach. Mr. Clinton held a 90-minute conversation with Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday night.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The new Prime Minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, won an easy confirmation vote today in the lower house of Parliament, bringing the brief political crisis to an eerily peaceful end.</p> <p>It was just a week ago that President Boris N. Yeltsin shuffled the political deck and confounded his Communist opposition by dismissing Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov on the eve of an impeachment debate.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>The Parliament is priming itself for a vote to impeach the President on charges that he brought Russia to ruin. The President's men talk darkly of dumping the Prime Minister, accusing him of leading the country back to its Communist past.</p> <p>Welcome to Russia's latest political crisis, where rumors are rife and political intriguers have already unsheathed their knives for a showdown Saturday, when the impeachment of President Boris N. Yeltsin is due to come to a vote.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Undeterred by calls from China and Russia to halt the bombing of Yugoslavia, American and other allied forces pounded targets across the country today as NATO leaders pledged to continue the air war until President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to meet all their demands.</p> <p>After relatively quiet nights following the bombing on Friday against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, NATO aircraft hit 37 targets overnight on Monday, including their first strike on Belgrade since Friday.  With clearing skies, NATO pressed the attack virtually without pause through the day and night today, American and NATO officials said.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Russia's special envoy on the Kosovo crisis, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met on Tuesday with China's top leaders to discuss the issue, as rage continued to boil here in response to the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.</p> <p>But early today, with demonstrations halted at least temporarily, the American Ambassador, James Sasser, walked out a back door to leave the embassy for the first time since Saturday, when angry demonstrations began. He planned to greet American families in nearby diplomatic residential compounds and then return to the embassy, where officials were hoping they could resume their work.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>After the fireworks of a failed impeachment attempt, the Russian Parliament's vote on Wednesday on a new Prime Minister promises to be surprisingly tame -- and it is likely to be a ''yes'' vote.</p> <p>More politicians today joined others who have indicated that they are ready to call a time-out in their battle against President Boris N. Yeltsin and to proceed swiftly with the approval of Sergei V. Stepashin, the 47-year-old Interior Minister named last week to succeed Yevgeny M. Primakov as Prime Minister.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Against the backdrop of Russia's political turmoil, the economy seems to be gradually reviving from its collapse last summer, with increased consumer spending and industrial production, a Moscow research group said today in a widely followed monthly report.</p> <p>Consumer expenditures rose 1.5 percent in March from February, the second consecutive month of growth, according to the report, Russian Economic Trends. Industrial production returned to its level in December 1997, the highest since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A week after NATO missiles hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, China and the United States hammered out a formal statement late Friday night expressing the Security Council's ''deep distress and concern'' about the attack.</p> <p>A deal was struck shortly before midnight when China agreed to drop an explicit statement of ''shock'' about the missile strike in exchange for the milder language.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>After a day of angry and vivid speeches that accused President Boris N. Yeltsin of crimes like treason and genocide, the Speaker of Parliament predicted tonight that the lower house would vote on Saturday to impeach him on at least one of the charges against him.</p> <p>As the crisis moved toward its next stage, the Speaker, Gennadi Seleznyov, a Communist who leads the 450-seat lower house, said the opposition to Mr. Yeltsin, strengthened by his decision this week to dismiss Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, would collect more than the 300 votes required to impeach.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Word that President Slobodan Milosevic may be indicted for war crimes on Thursday, the day a Russian envoy is due here to discuss a peace settlement for Kosovo, stunned Serbs tonight, dampening hopes for an end to the war.</p> <p>As the Government cracked down on antiwar dissent, charging an elected official with treason, a former confidant of Mr. Milosevic suggested that the Yugoslav leader  might intensify the conflict by carrying it to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The international tribunal in The Hague has decided to indict Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, for war crimes and will formally announce the action on Thursday, Western officials said today.</p> <p>The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to specify the charges for which Mr. Milosevic is to be indicted. But Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, began an investigation into responsibility for war crimes in Kosovo last year, and has intensified her inquiries in recent weeks.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Negotiations toward a solution to the Kosovo crisis broke up unusually late tonight with no clear evidence of progress, but representatives of Russia, the United States and the European Union planned to try again on Thursday.</p> <p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the American representative, said there had been ''good talks,'' but declined further comment.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>Reflecting concern that the war in Kosovo is diverting political energy and  scarce resources from other conflicts, Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed today to world leaders to do more next month at the meeting of major industrialized nations to help the developing world.</p> <p>In a letter to the heads of the  Group of Seven industrialized countries and Russia, Mr. Annan pressed for increased development aid and greater debt relief for debt-ridden third-world countries and additional steps to shore up the international financial system, whose stability he said is key to preventing global recession.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Clinton Administration has concluded that an indictment of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on  charges of war crimes would not preclude direct negotiations on Kosovo with the Serbian leader, senior American officials said today.</p> <p>''We don't rule out further contacts if they are necessary to achieve our objectives and further our national interest,'' said a senior Administration official.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The NATO allies now believe they will need nearly twice the 28,000 peacekeeping troops they originally planned to station in Kosovo in a negotiated settlement, allied and American officials said today.</p> <p>American and other NATO officials said the alliance would need perhaps as many as 50,000 soldiers to enforce any Kosovo settlement, even if NATO bombing eventually forced President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept allied demands to stop attacking ethnic Albanian civilians in the province, withdraw Serbian forces and let the refugees and peacekeepers enter unopposed.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Western allies and Russia have narrowed their differences over a future international force in Kosovo to the point where they will be able to issue a joint statement Thursday on ending the conflict in the Serbian province, American and NATO officials said today.</p> <p>A senior German official said an outline accord had been reached with Russia on the need for ''an international civil and security presence'' that would enter Kosovo under a United Nations mandate after an eventual withdrawal of Serbian forces.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>While NATO leaders congratulated themselves on Thursday for nudging Russia over to their side in the search for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo, Russian diplomats took another view, claiming a small but significant victory in their monthlong attempt to mediate a peace.</p> <p>Seen from Moscow, the document signed in Bonn on Thursday by the foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven industrial countries had the ring of a compromise, a classic example of diplomatic give and take.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Clinton today described the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia as a model for the force that is envisioned to return and protect ethnic Albanian refugees to Kosovo.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton said that the arrangement, which includes American soldiers working under the direction of NATO with United Nations approval, was a good model because it involved Russian and Ukrainian participation even though NATO was involved.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is expected to complicate, and could even undermine, efforts by the United States and other NATO members to win United Nations endorsement of an international peacekeeping force for Kosovo, Administration officials acknowledged tonight.</p> <p>China, which has a veto in the United Nations Security Council, has steadfastly opposed the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and has made clear its suspicion about the motives of the Western alliance.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>The day after President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was indicted on war crimes charges, a search for a negotiated solution to the conflict in Kosovo proceeded today, clouded by uncertainty and recriminations.</p> <p>The Russian envoy voiced some hope, but the United States withheld judgment.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>When Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia sat down to talk about Kosovo this week at Stalin's old dacha outside Moscow, they pulled up an empty chair. The fourth chair, according to an American official, was to remind them at all times that the key figure in their endeavor was not there.</p> <p>In fact, since his indictment on Thursday on charges of war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague, it has been virtually certain that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia would never sit in that fourth chair, at least not with an American present. As an indicted war criminal, he is unlikely to join in negotiations with NATO.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful, undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.</p> <p>The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not the constant ''cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous today, not endlessly diverse.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'atomic weapons', 'espionage', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade threatens to drag out a diplomatic solution in Kosovo and to inflict long-term damage on an already-troubled relationship between the United States and China, officials said today.</p> <p>Although Clinton Administration officials were confident at first that the crisis would soon blow over, they now see signs that the Chinese Government may delay a United Nations Security Council resolution requiring an international security force in Kosovo, a senior Administration official said. That resolution is at the heart of a proposed diplomatic settlement of the conflict.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid']	<p>The United States is planning to begin dropping supplies to the half-million  Albanians forced from their homes and hiding in the Kosovo hills with little food or medicine, the State Department announced today.</p> <p>''The U.S. has been preparing a strategy for airdrops, and we are going to be doing airdrops, hopefully, starting two weeks from tomorrow,'' said Julia Taft, Assistant Secretary of State for Refugees.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Having fired a Government, squelched an impeachment drive and installed a colorless but loyal police commander as Prime Minister and potential successor, President Boris N. Yeltsin headed south on Friday for what his aides described as a well-deserved vacation.</p> <p>As for ordinary Russians, they were left -- once again -- out in the cold and in the dark. If the extraordinary events of the last 11 days proved anything, it was that Russia's fledgling democracy is as secretive and arcane as the Communist regime it replaced seven years ago.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the stolid former Russian Prime Minister, and Al Gore, the stolid American Vice President, are engaged in an intensive search for a diplomatic exit to the bloodshed in the Balkans, an effort that brings some risk to both men, but potentially large benefits.</p> <p>Over the past two days, Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin conducted a movable meeting that migrated from Mr. Gore's small quarters in the West Wing of the White House to the Oval Office to the exercise room of Mr. Gore's official residence.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Clinton Administration officials said today that they believe they have persuaded the Russian envoy to the Balkans that a military force, rather than just a monitoring mission, would be needed in Kosovo after the bombing campaign.</p> <p>The White House outlined some details of the talks that the envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, held on Monday with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Chernomyrdin continued his diplomatic efforts today at the United Nations, where he met with Secretary General Kofi Annan.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>NATO's political leaders have overruled a draft proposal by the alliance's senior commander to fire on ships that defy an oil blockade against Yugoslavia, raising questions about how effectively such an action can be enforced, officials said today.</p> <p>Although many countries are honoring the blockade, oil continues to arrive in Yugoslavia by sea.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary General Kofi Annan announced today that he intended to send a mission to Yugoslavia to assess relief needs, but faced immediate skepticism from the United States and Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Annan said the Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Sergio Vieira de Mello, wrote today to the Yugoslav representative here to request permission for the team to enter the country. United Nations relief agencies have not been in Kosovo since shortly after the NATO bombing began on March 24.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Slobodan Milosevic kicked off the negotiations with his usual historical harangue.</p> <p>The Serbian strongman lectured a Russian envoy, Victor S. Chernomyrdin, and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland on Wednesday on the meaning of Kosovo to the Serbs.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>After meeting for more than five hours with NATO officials on the border of Kosovo, Yugoslav military officers failed today to agree to the terms of their withdrawal from the southern Serbian province, saying they needed more time to check with leaders in Belgrade.</p> <p>Five senior Yugoslav military officers came here today to meet with top NATO commanders in order to review and sign NATO's terms for their withdrawal from Kosovo after 10 weeks of bombardment by the alliance.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Are we witnessing a diplomatic victory that will bring peace to the Balkans? Or will President Clinton win the Neville Chamberlain memorial umbrella trophy for accepting a phony peace? Let us hope for the former -- although much evidence suggests the latter will come to pass.</p> <p>It would have been difficult to achieve peace even if Slobodan Milosevic had fully accepted NATO's demands: stop the ethnic cleansing, pull all Serb forces out of Kosovo, allow all Kosovo refugees to return home, accept a NATO military force in Kosovo and accept a politically autonomous Kosovo and an eventual plebiscite for full sovereignty.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Kosovo war has brought radical changes to the European continent, thrusting Germany into a leading military role not seen since 1945, galvanizing attempts to forge a common European defense policy and altering Europe's relationship with the United States.</p> <p>Of course, with Russian stability still deeply uncertain, and the abrupt movements of Russian troops in Kosovo suggesting that Moscow's military may be restive, Europeans remain wary of any ''decoupling'' from Washington. But the desire to maintain trans-Atlantic ties is now accompanied by a push to balance them in a new way.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and other senior American leaders spoke with their counterparts in Russia today but were unable to resolve the impasse over Russian troops that has marred the beginning of the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.</p> <p>American officials tried to put the best face on the military and diplomatic mess, but it was clear that Russia and the United States remain far apart on critical questions arising from Russia's demand to take part in the Kosovo military operation on its own terms.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'news and news media']	<p>NATO slowly expanded its control over a central swath of Kosovo today, pouring thousands more soldiers into major towns and villages but effectively ceding the airport here in the capital to about 200 Russian soldiers who defiantly occupied it three days ago.</p> <p>By this evening, NATO officials reported no new clashes today like  ones on Sunday. The force's commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of Britain, said today that German and British troops who had opened fired in separate confrontations on Sunday in Prizren and Pristina, killing two Serbs, had acted justifiably when threatened.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>For many years the standard quip about NATO was that NATO existed to ''keep the Germans down, the Americans in [Europe] and the Russians out.'' In light of NATO's U.S.-led victory in Kosovo, though, that old cliche is going to have to be adapted. NATO's new mission is ''to keep the Balkans quiet, the Americans in and the Russians sweet.''</p> <p>No one planned it this way, but managing the bloody turmoil in the Balkans, not the Eastern Front, and managing the zany, unpredictable weakness of Russia, not its strength, have now emerged as NATO's primary missions. Ever since the cold war ended, NATO planners have been groping for a new mission, a senior NATO official remarked to me at NATO's Brussels headquarters, and the Balkans is turning out to be it.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Two weeks after the first NATO peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo, the first military aircraft landed here today at the province's main airport, which NATO commanders said could soon open to regular flights.</p> <p>A hulking Russian cargo plane touched down at 1:19 P.M., followed moments later by a French C-130 in what was an orchestrated effort to highlight the cooperation of Russian and allied troops after the diplomatic standoff caused when a contingent of Russians occupied the airport on June 12, hours before NATO's forces started streaming into Kosovo.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid']	<p>The European Union today announced plans to provide $1.5 billion during the next three years for the reconstruction of Kosovo as the West tried to map out a strategy that would channel money to the war-devastated area without giving financial support to a Serbia controlled by Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>Gunter Burghardt, the director-general for the European Union's  Balkan policy, said the 15-nation bloc would provide $500 million annually over three years to Kosovo ''irrespective of whether Milosevic is there or not.'' He added that the Yugoslav President, indicted by the international war crimes tribunal last month, had to be isolated.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>When the Clinton Administration invited Russia to help it out of the war in Kosovo, the idea was that the involvement in big game diplomacy would help maintain Washington-Moscow ties, and even improve the ailing relationship.</p> <p>But now, as President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is about to make his first foreign trip in four months on Sunday and to meet here with President Clinton, as many -- if not more -- questions are hanging over the dialogue as were before the war.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>With the key issue of the distribution of Russian forces in Kosovo still unsettled, American and Russian negotiators returned to the table tonight, with orders to work through the night.</p> <p>The Russian Defense Minister, Igor D. Sergeyev, and the Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told their American counterparts early this evening that they would return to Moscow for consultations tonight. But they were persuaded instead to press ahead with work on a complex agreement defining Russia's role in Kosovo.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Bill Clinton held firm. That was a crucial fact in the Kosovo war, and it should be recognized. Under savage criticism at home and abroad, the President stuck to his policy. And it prevailed.</p> <p>Right up to the denouement, critics predicted that the President would weaken his demands on Yugoslavia. A writer in The Times of London, Ben Macintyre, wrote: ''Clinton is seeking a diplomatic escape route that will allow him to cut his losses and save face. . . . It is the modus operandi of a man whose primary instincts are to vacillate, compromise and then gloss.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The arrival of Russian troops in Pristina before dawn today raises disturbing questions about the Kremlin's control of the military.</p> <p>After the troops moved into Yugoslavia on Friday, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov assured the Clinton Administration that the force would not enter Kosovo until Russia had reached an understanding with NATO.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Breaking Moscow's assurances to Washington, a long column of Russian troops entered Kosovo and its capital early this morning amid wild celebration by local Serbs.</p> <p>The troops, who had been stationed in Bosnia as part of the peacekeeping force there, continued through Pristina to the suburb of Kosovo Polje, where they halted.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The White House was first stunned and then bewildered tonight to learn that Russian troops had rolled into Pristina, the Kosovo capital, after receiving assurances from Moscow all day that its troops would not move in until NATO had given them a green light.</p> <p>After initial concerns that sent Administration officials into an hourlong emergency huddle and lighted up the phone lines to Moscow, the White House was reassured by Moscow that the advance into Pristina in fact was a mistake and that Russia was ordering the troops to leave immediately.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin placed two familiar and reform-minded fiscal experts in top economic posts today.</p> <p>But after a week of brutal infighting among his closest advisers, the question of who really controls his latest Government seemed no clearer than before.</p>
['foreign investments', 'elections', 'finances']	<p>Foreign investors in the Far Eastern Shipping Company of Russia have accused a top politician of using extortion to try to wrest away their stakes in the concern, causing a shareholder rights scandal that is the latest of several to erode the weak faith remaining in the Russian equities market.</p> <p>Based in Vladivostok, Far Eastern Shipping is the nation's largest commercial shipping line and is 42 percent owned by foreign investors. Andrew Fox, chairman of a Vladivostok brokerage firm, Tiger Securities, and a Far Eastern Shipping board member representing nearly all foreign investors, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that the province governor, Yevgeny I. Nazdratenko, summoned him on June 3 to express displeasure with the extent of foreign ownership in the company.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>As a military operation, it was insignificant. But as a symbol, there is no more potent metaphor for Russia's regard of the West than the image last weekend of 200 Russian soldiers seizing a Kosovo airfield, and then lining up armored personnel carriers to keep NATO troops out.</p> <p>Kremlin officials offered a strategic explanation for the move, involving the need to acquire bargaining chips in talks on Kosovo's future and to establish Moscow once and for all as a player in the peace process.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In an effort to break an impasse over how Russian troops will operate in Kosovo, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen is to suggest to his Russian counterpart that the troops be allotted an ''area of responsibility'' within one of the five established NATO sectors, Administration officials said today.</p> <p>Mr. Cohen also plans to propose a command structure that he hopes will satisfy the Russians' demand that their troops not report directly to an allied commander, but will not violate NATO's insistence on a unified command for the entire security force, the officials said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Investors in the Russian Far East are used to working with risks: the currency is fragile, deposits disappear when banks close, and companies can be taxed out of existence before they show a profit.</p> <p>But a new threat this week has rattled foreign business groups here: a regional governor announced on Monday that he was using the main successor agency to the K.G.B. to investigate whether a prominent British businessman had illegally obtained shares for foreign clients in Russia's biggest shipping company.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>A Turkish security court today sentenced the Kurdish rebel leader, Abdullah Ocalan, to death for his 15-year campaign against the Turkish Army.</p> <p>Because of the violence that followed Mr. Ocalan's arrest in February, the sentence set off concerns for security around the country and beyond. But there were no reports of violent reaction either in Turkey, where the police were on high alert, or elsewhere. Kurds staged peaceful protests in Bonn, Moscow, The Hague, Paris and other European cities. Others scuffled with the police in Rome and Nicosia, Cyprus.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>While talks were under way today in Bonn, NATO held back on carrying out threats to intensify its bombing of Yugoslavia if Belgrade did not promptly accept allied terms on Kosovo. But near midnight explosions and antiaircraft fire erupted in the capital, which had been quiet for several nights.</p> <p>[Serbian oil refineries, including one at Pancevo near Belgrade, were struck early on Tuesday, Reuters reported from the capital. The Batajnica suburb of Belgrade, site of a military airfield, was also bombed.]</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Administration officials expressed hope today that the snags in talks about Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo would be resolved within days.</p> <p>White House aides acknowledged that they had been excessively optimistic after the agreement on Thursday by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to NATO's terms for ending the 10-week conflict. And they implied that they had overreacted when the talks on the military details stumbled on Sunday.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>After eight hours of negotiations, Russia balked today at approving a resolution to be sent to the United Nations Security Council on the future of Kosovo and the role of 50,000 peacekeepers.</p> <p>But in other areas, considerable progress was made today when foreign ministers met near here, and the latest stumbling blocks may be resolved quickly.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>When he heard the news of a peace deal between NATO and the Yugoslav Government last week -- a deal that might send him back home after two months as a refugee -- Ismet Memaj reacted by celebrating.</p> <p>''I drank all day,'' said Mr. Memaj, a 52-year-old construction worker.  ''It's true. I was so happy.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>You don't need to be Clausewitz to figure out what finally brought Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table on NATO's terms and why he is now stalling again. The answer to both questions is Russia.</p> <p>The best way to understand Russia's critical role is to think of a divorce proceeding: You are negotiating a divorce with your wife. She has no lawyer and you have Johnnie Cochran. Every time your wife asks for something, Mr. Cochran steps in to protect you with a point of law. Things are going so well, you ask for a lunch break. When you come back from lunch you find that Mr. Cochran has switched sides and is now acting as your wife's lawyer, nodding in agreement at all her demands. You're in trouble.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Germany today received a letter from the Yugoslav Government in which President Slobodan Milosevic said he was ready to withdraw forces from Kosovo and accept a ''United Nations presence'' in the Serbian province.</p> <p>But Mr. Milosevic also demanded an immediate end to NATO's 70-day-old bombardment if a settlement is to be reached and made clear that significant differences with the West remain.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>NATO military planners heard today how many troops and tanks the allies and other countries would provide for the beefed-up, 45,000-strong peacekeeping force planned for Kosovo if diplomacy brings a settlement there. But allied officials said Russia, a key diplomatic player, was keeping its distance.</p> <p>The allies kept up the pressure on Serbian forces with 778 missions overnight, including 319 bombing runs and 89 attacks on Serbian air defenses. Gen. Ljubisa Velickovic, a Yugoslav Deputy Chief of Staff, was killed in air strikes near Belgrade, military officials there reported.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In the spring of 1988, germ scientists 850 miles east of Moscow were ordered to undertake their most critical mission.</p> <p>The scientists, working in great haste and total secrecy in Sverdlovsk, first transferred hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria -- enough to destroy the world's people many times over -- into giant stainless steel canisters.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The reasonable face of Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin, walked stiffly, but his presence here today was enough to reassure President Clinton and other Western leaders that dialogue with Moscow was possible in the aftermath of the Kosovo war.</p> <p>After weeks of tensions since the start of the war, culminating in an unnerving standoff between Russian and NATO troops at the main airport in Kosovo, the Russian and American leaders met today and decided to let bygones be bygones, according to Mr. Clinton's aides.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations and Russia outlined a plan today for ending eight years of war in the Balkans through a vast program of aid and political support, but said Yugoslavia must undertake ''democratic and economic reforms'' to take part.</p> <p>At the end of a three-day summit meeting, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany said that in their view, democratic reform in Yugoslavia would have to involve the departure of President Slobodan Milosevic, but in deference to Russia no explicit reference to him was included in the final statement.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'biographical information']	<p>Yuli Edelstein is probably the only member of the Israeli Cabinet, much less the only one in a yarmulke, whose father is a Russian Orthodox priest.</p> <p>He is probably the only Beatlemaniac in that august group, and probably the only one who ever made a living as a nude model at an art institute in Moscow.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said today that President Boris N. Yeltsin had authorized the early entry of Russian troops into Kosovo, a deployment that surprised American officials and possibly senior members of his own Government.</p> <p>At a Pentagon briefing today, Mr. Cohen declined to characterize the presence of Russian troops in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, as a mistake, a term widely used in the last 24 hours by various Administration, NATO and Moscow officials as they played down a Russian move that stole the spotlight from NATO's entry into Kosovo.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Taking a tough line toward Russian troops who moved into Pristina without NATO's approval last night, the alliance's top general warned today that the commander of the NATO peacekeeping force had authority to order them to leave.</p> <p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the American commander of NATO forces in Europe, said here that the allies would welcome Russian participation in the force, but only under a command arrangement with the alliance.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>American diplomats and military representatives today held talks with Russian counterparts about how to make the best of the de facto presence of some 200 Russian soldiers in Kosovo.</p> <p>The talks, held in Moscow and Macedonia, were clouded by distrust and confusion over whether President Boris N. Yeltsin himself had ordered the deployment.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Thousands of NATO troops with armored vehicles moved methodically into Kosovo today, hours after about 200 Russian soldiers infuriated and startled Washington by entering the Kosovo capital and taking up positions at the military airport.</p> <p>The embarrassing squabbling between Moscow and the West took some luster off NATO's triumphal entry into the blasted province after a 78-day bombing campaign, which succeeded in forcing the Yugoslav Government to cede effective control over Kosovo and allow the eventual return of more than a million refugees to what remains of their homes.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia and the United States, ending three days of grueling negotiations, signed a military agreement today that integrates Russia into the Kosovo peacekeeping force, dividing most of the 3,600 planned Russian troops among three of five sectors led by NATO countries.</p> <p>The agreement broke a tense stalemate over Russia's role in Kosovo and opened the way for restoration of Russia's links to the Western alliance, which Moscow froze last March when NATO began airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Russia's historical ally in the Balkans.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A few hundred Russian soldiers in Kosovo, commanded by a general who outranks the British lieutenant general who will be in charge of the 50,000 NATO troops there, have had the alliance tied up in knots since last weekend trying to figure out how Russians can be included without being under NATO command.</p> <p>In fact, allied officials said today, NATO's military relationship with Russia started going seriously wrong months ago, when Moscow tried to assign a senior military intelligence officer to the alliance's command headquarters in Mons, Belgium.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The chief negotiators for Russia and NATO haggled for a fourth day to no avail today over how and where Russian troops would serve in a Kosovo peacekeeping operation.</p> <p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russia's foreign minister, Ivan Ivanov, met for only about two hours before the talks broke up. Mr. Talbott said he was hopeful that the two sides could make progress. President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin also discussed the peacekeeping issue by telephone this afternoon, but agreed only to talk again.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'news and news media', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russian soldiers occupying the Pristina airport blocked the entry of British troops today in an embarrassing impasse for NATO's nascent peacekeeping effort in Kosovo.</p> <p>While President Clinton discussed the stalemate with the Russian leader, Boris N. Yeltsin, by telephone,  British officers fumed that the place they had picked for their headquarters had, in effect, been confiscated.  Commanders spent much of the day, apparently without success, searching for an alternative site.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Winston Churchill liked to tell the story of the man who tried to give the powder to the bear, and all the elaborate preparations he made to do so -- ''but the bear blew first.'' Decayed and decrepit though it is, the Russian bear blew faster than NATO when it came to sending peacekeepers into Kosovo. It taught us a lesson about speed and surprise -- and if it is true that NATO's advance into Kosovo was delayed to prepare for photo opportunities, then it was a lesson we badly needed.</p> <p>The Russian position on the ground is of course extremely weak. Unless Bulgaria gives permission for Russian overflights, it will be virtually impossible to reinforce the Russian forces in Kosovo, though they will doubtless be supplied by the Serbs. It is therefore in NATO's power to blockade the Russians and force them out.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>In 1967, when Yale, like many other universities, was in ferment over the war in Vietnam, James Reston, the New York Times columnist, was in New Haven and ran into a 21-year-old junior named Strobe Talbott.</p> <p>When Mr. Reston asked Mr. Talbott where he stood on the war, Mr. Reston wrote in his column, this is the response he got: ''I do not want to help pillory the present Administration. I am interested to see if there are new means and attitudes by which this university, and hence the university community in general, can make discussion less polemical and more meaningful and at the same time help the search for peace.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>China and Russia repeated their demand today that NATO air strikes be halted before political talks to resolve the crisis in Yugoslavia begin.</p> <p>Russia's Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, spent the day meeting with China's top leaders, discussing their shared opposition to the NATO bombing campaign and their mutual desire to foster a ''strategic partnership'' aimed at offsetting the global dominance of the United States.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russian and NATO envoys delivered an incomplete draft of a peace settlement to President Slobodan Milosevic today, and after a two-hour meeting, Mr. Milosevic said he and his Government would study the proposals overnight and meet the envoys again at 9 A.M. Thursday.</p> <p>In a sign that Mr. Milosevic was taking this approach from the West and Russia seriously, leading legislators from Serbia's Parliament were hastily summoned to a late-night meeting to discuss the proposals. Serbian state television said there would be a special session of the Parliament on Thursday morning.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia and the West narrowed their differences today over the measures required to end the war in Kosovo, limiting the room for President Slobodan Milosevic to maneuver and increasing the pressure on him to reach a settlement.</p> <p>''We have found a common approach,'' said Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, after a marathon negotiating session in Bonn with American and European officials that went on through much of Tuesday night and ended only this afternoon.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>European foreign ministers and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pronounced themselves well satisfied today after haggling for 12 hours over the draft of a United Nations Security Council resolution on Kosovo.</p> <p>But their handiwork, which is supposed to provide the basis for an end to the war, leaves plenty of unanswered questions and some loopholes that could be exploited by President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>An end to the war in Kosovo crept closer today with agreement among the United States, six allies and Russia on a plan to send peacekeepers into the shattered Yugoslav province, perhaps in a week.</p> <p>Shortly after the Russians, who had resisted certain provisions of the plan, dropped their objections at a conference in Cologne, Germany, NATO and Yugoslav generals reopened crucial negotiations at a remote site in Macedonia on detailed provisions for a withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo. Negotiations on that subject, which had broken down over the weekend, continued into Macedonia's dawn. [Page A12.]</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>When Russia's special envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, went to Belgrade last week with the President of Finland to help resolve the Kosovo conflict, he was seen in the West as a heroic statesman.</p> <p>But no sooner did Mr. Chernomyrdin return to Moscow than he ran into a buzz saw of criticism. Communist lawmakers demanded that he be censured for working too closely with NATO.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>A blisteringly hot summer and the reverberations from Russia's economic crisis have taken a devastating toll on the nation's crops, making it likely that Moscow will appeal for American food aid, according to Russian and American officials.</p> <p>Russia had hoped to harvest 70 million tons of grain this year. But Western experts estimate that Russian farms will yield no more than 55 million tons.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The deadlock between Yugoslav and NATO military officials negotiating in a tent on the barren Macedonia border was finally broken after some sharp exchanges nearly a thousand miles away in an elaborate 15th-century meeting hall.</p> <p>An irritated Russian Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, broke into a discussion among foreign ministers on another matter here late this afternoon. He charged that the Americans and NATO were responsible for the stalemate in the tent, according to Clinton Administration officials and other diplomats.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>More than 80 years after they died at the hands of Bolshevik executioners, the son of Czar Aleksandr II and three other members of the Romanov dynasty were cleared of wrongdoing tonight by the Prosecutor General, Russia's chief law enforcement officer.</p> <p>Grand Duke Pavel Aleksandrovich Romanov, Czar Aleksandr's son, was rehabilitated along with three Romanov princes -- Nikolai Mikhailovich, Dmitri Konstantinovich and Georgi Mikhailovich -- after a review of their case was demanded by a matriarch of the family.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Setting aside policy differences over Kosovo, Iraq and other contentious issues, the United States and Russia concluded an agreement in Washington yesterday extending for seven years programs to reduce the threat posed by nuclear, biological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>In a ceremony at the Russian Embassy yesterday morning, Russia's Ambassador, Yuri V. Ushakov, signed the agreement and shook hands with senior Defense Department officials to celebrate the extension of the umbrella agreement that authorizes the Cooperative Threat Reduction program.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>After seven hours of intense talks,  Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and his Russian counterpart, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, said tonight that they had made progress toward a resolution of the touchy issue of Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping force.</p> <p>But neither side was ready to predict with certainty that a final agreement would be ready on Thursday, when Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov join the marathon negotiations being held in the Presidential Palace here.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>On the 72d day of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic accepted an international peace plan today to end the Kosovo conflict and allow nearly one million ethnic Albanian refugees to return to what is left of their homes.</p> <p>After forcing most of those refugees to flee from Kosovo and enduring thousands of Serbian military and civilian deaths, Mr. Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament agreed rapidly to all key NATO demands after envoys from Russia and other European nations brought what they made clear was the best offer he was going to get from NATO.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Despite its outspoken criticism of allied bombing raids, Russia played a vital role in advancing NATO's peace plan for Kosovo, Western diplomats and Russian officials said today.</p> <p>The Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, supported the two-page list of demands that President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland presented to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia during talks in Belgrade this week.</p>
['news and news media', 'elections']	<p>Someone not familiar with the average Russian's bent for intrigue might find it strange that one of Moscow's most influential newspapers was sold last week to an offshore investment fund run by two Iranians from a nearly empty Manhattan office.</p> <p>But a lot is going on with the raucous press these days, much of it unsettling, and Russians who have been fitting the pieces together do not find such a sale strange at all. They suspect that the Iranians are a front for one power broker or another. An election campaign is beginning, and everyone with power, from business moguls to the Government, is angling to influence the outcome.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, in Moscow for the first time since the end of the cold war, signaled tonight that he might be ready to rejoin the Middle East peace effort he abandoned after Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's Prime Minister in 1996.</p> <p>In a statement issued by Mr. Assad and President Boris N. Yeltsin, the two leaders said the election of Ehud Barak as Prime Minister of Israel opened ''specific opportunities for constructive efforts towards a comprehensive and just peace'' in the region.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'biographical information']	<p>The board of Russia's largest shipping company elected a ranking official of the Russian Government as the company's chairman today, bowing to pressure from a powerful regional governor who has expressed anger over the influence of foreign investors in post-communist Russia.</p> <p>The choice of Aleksandr Lugovets, Russia's Deputy Transportation Minister, to lead the board of the Far Eastern Shipping Company is the latest in a series of moves by Yevgeny I. Nazdratenko, Governor of the southeastern finger of Russia known as the region of Primorsky, to reduce the role of foreign investors in the company. Mr. Nazdratenko's nationalist zeal has received attention from foreign investors in Russia as an indication of resentment over non-Russian ownership stakes in privatized Russian businesses.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russian airborne troops flew into Kosovo today, starting the deployment of the main Russian peacekeeping contingent, a day after NATO and Russia worked out the last wrinkles to their participation.</p> <p>The arrival of about 200 Russians was greeted with general relief on the ground. It signaled the opening of Slatina airport, just west of the capital, Pristina, for military flights, and for the first United Nations relief flight today, which arrived with vital communications equipment.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'united states armament and defense', 'finances']	<p>The Coca-Cola Company's major bottler in Central and Eastern Europe reported an unexpectedly steep drop in first-half volume sales yesterday and its stock fell sharply.</p> <p>The bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages, attributed the 5 percent decline in volume, measured in cases sold, to severe economic problems in Russia, the Kosovo conflict, the company's recent bottled-water recalls in Poland and bad publicity from Coca-Cola beverage recalls in Belgium and France, which were handled by a different bottler.</p>

['espionage', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Sergei V. Stepashin, the new Prime Minister of Russia, warned today that the United States should not assume the role of international policeman, a sign that relations between the two countries remain frayed by the American-led military intervention in Kosovo.</p> <p>Mr. Stepashin, in Washington to meet with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other American leaders, rejected the notion of a ''Clinton doctrine'' of intervention in internal conflicts in sovereign nations. ''It is very dangerous,'' he warned at a luncheon at the National Press Club.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States and its NATO allies have blocked Russia from flying hundreds of troops into Kovoso this weekend, before details of Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force could be worked out, Administration officials said today.</p> <p>In the last 48 hours, Russia asked Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria for use of their airspace to fly 10 planeloads of peacekeepers on Sunday into Pristina, the provincial capital, the officials said. But those nations rejected the request after consulting with top American and NATO officials, the Administration officials said. Hungary is a new member of NATO, while both Romania and Bulgaria would like to join the alliance.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a fresh sign of the tensions that have grown between the United States and Russia since the war in Kosovo, Moscow has ordered an American military attache to leave the country, American officials said today.</p> <p>The American officer, Lieut. Col. Peter Hoffman, the assistant Army attache at the United States Embassy in Moscow, was declared persona non grata and left Russia Thursday evening, officials said.</p>

Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, met here tonight in their first conversation since the Kosovo war.  They touched on the Balkans, where differences remain, but dwelt more on arms reduction, Iraq and economics.</p> <p>The discussion, after a daylong session of the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will be followed by meetings in Washington on Tuesday between the new Russian Prime Minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>NATO and Russian military commanders resolved their differences over Russia's role in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo today, clearing the way for about 3,600 more Russian troops to arrive in the Serbian province after weeks of wrangling.</p> <p>The first planeloads of Russian paratroopers could begin arriving as soon as Tuesday at Kosovo's main airport west of the capital, Pristina, alliance and Russian officials said. There they will join several hundred Russian troops who have hunkered down there since they entered Serbia on June 12, beating NATO peacekeepers by hours.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russian bombers flew close enough to Iceland and Norway last week to cause the United States and Norway to scramble fighter planes as a precaution, a National Security Council official said tonight.</p> <p>He said the eyebrow-raising incident, reminiscent of the kind of Kremlin muscle-flexing that was common during the cold war, occurred as part of Russia's largest military exercises since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The exercises, named West '99, involved up to 50,000 troops, more than 30 ships and Russian Air Force and naval aircraft.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'finances']	<p>Cementing the relationship between the Kremlin and big business, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was installed today as chairman of Russia's biggest company, the natural gas monopoly Gazprom.</p> <p>The move returns the former Prime Minister, who recently served as Moscow's envoy to the Balkans, to the company where he began his career.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Despite an agreement reached in Helsinki almost two weeks ago, Russia and NATO are still arguing about exactly where Russian peacekeepers should go in Kosovo and whose orders they should follow, alliance officials said today.</p> <p>Russian military negotiators led by Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov have been trying to work out the details in talks with the allied military command in Belgium but have insisted on letting their troops take orders only from Russian officers, not NATO ones, allied officials said.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Several thousand Kosovo Albanians marched through this little town today, in the fourth day of peaceful protests against plans to station Russian troops among the NATO peacekeepers here.</p> <p>The Albanians assert that Russian mercenaries fought as members of  the nationalist Serbian militias that carried out a campaign of killing, looting and burning across the southwest corner of Kosovo and that the Russians would be overly solicitous of the handful of remaining Serbs.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Serbian generals, touring the country to stanch protests and dismantle roadblocks set up by angry army reservists owed money for duty in Kosovo, are dousing one rebellious fire after another.</p> <p>At least for now, the generals have apparently succeeded in redirecting some of the rage from President Slobodan Milosevic toward the latest enemy of the Serbs -- Russia.</p>
['elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The major contenders in Russia's 2000 presidential election already are slinging mud by the bucketful, the Kremlin is under criminal investigation and the Communist Party's once-unassailable base in Parliament is developing serious stress cracks. But as political issues go, it is safe to say all that pales next to this summer's national fixation: the price of a liter of gas.</p> <p>In one of the world's largest oil-producing nations, ordinary Russians are combusting over the rising cost of benzin, and everyone from President Boris N. Yeltsin to lowly regional legislators is seeking cover from the fallout.</p>
['taxation', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>Despite a booming American economy, President Clinton moved today to restrict imports of two politically sensitive products -- steel from Brazil and lamb from Australia and New Zealand -- in response to complaints from unions and farmers that their livelihoods were threatened by a surge of under-priced imports.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton has justified each of the moves as examples of how his Administration is enforcing dumping laws, a critical step, Administration officials say, to build support for open trade. But abroad, Mr. Clinton's decisions are viewed quite differently, as more evidence that the United States, while talking up the merits of free trade, is increasingly closing its borders to imports.</p>
['elections']	<p>Former Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin emerged today as the leader of a new centrist alliance, as the unofficial race to succeed President Boris N. Yeltsin gathered momentum.</p> <p>Mr. Stepashin will lead a political coalition that includes Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and Sergei V. Kiriyenko, two former Prime Ministers who, like Mr. Stephashin, were also fired by Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
['public opinion']	<p>If in watching President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest game of political shuffleboard, you feel you have seen this movie  before, you are almost right. It's ''Groundhog Day,'' the 1993 film in which Bill Murray plays a man who is condemned to reliving the same events over and over again.</p> <p>So it is here in Moscow, where ordinary citizens and political commentators are wearily picking their way through the debris of what some were still calling a Government crisis, despite the fact that Mr. Yeltsin has changed his Government so many times in the last 17 months -- four to be exact -- that the word ''crisis'' has lost all meaning.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russian soldiers at three checkpoints were fired on overnight and four other checkpoints were attacked, a spokesman for the international peacekeeping forces said here today. Sixteen people were arrested, he added.</p> <p>While the spokesman, Maj. Jan Joosten, insisted that the overall security situation in Kosovo was improving, senior international officials said they were troubled by the rash of attacks on peacekeepers that has followed the killing of 14 Serbs in Gracko on Aug. 1.</p>
['elections']	<p>In his eight years as Russia's first popularly elected President, Boris N. Yeltsin has shown that he can stomach vicious criticism, manage a virulent Communist opposition and emerge bloodied but whole from a disastrous civil war.</p> <p>What he has never accepted is to have his views discounted, which is what occurred this week, when two powerful wings of the political establishment banded together to form an electoral alliance, against the wishes of the presidential administration in the Kremlin and despite its best efforts to block the move.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>As old as the forbidden fruit, and as hardy a perennial, corruption is back in.</p> <p>Take Russia. When the Soviet Union first collapsed, the first worry in the West was of a Communist revanche. Then it was mass hunger. Then it was resistance to radical reform. Now, virtually to the exclusion of everything else, it is ''koruptsiya'' -- the image of last week's Communists, yesterday's reformers and over-dressed ''New Russians'' amassing billions through plunder and crony capitalism.</p>
['elections']	<p>If ever there was an example of how hard it is for Russia's liberal politicians to work together, it came today with the implosion of Sergei V. Stepashin's new centrist electoral bloc.</p> <p>Today was to have been the day  that Mr. Stepashin, ousted as Prime Minister by President Boris N. Yeltsin this month, announced that he would be leading the new alliance. It was an attempt to capture the political center by pulling together liberal reformers like Sergei V. Kiriyenko under one banner with power brokers like Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, both men also former prime ministers.</p>
['currency', 'finances', 'elections', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>As the race to succeed him next year threatens to slip out of his control, President Boris N. Yeltsin tipped his hand, and Russia's political apple cart, by firing his Prime Minister today and replacing him with a former K.G.B.  officer and loyal aide who he said was his favorite to become the next president.</p> <p>From a politician who regularly uses surprise as a weapon, Mr. Yeltsin's latest move, nominating Vladimir V. Putin (pronounced POO-teen) to replace Sergei V. Stepashin -- in his fourth Government shake-up in 17 months -- was met with more dismay than shock. Even former allies accused him of playing politics at the expense of the increasingly fragile authority of Russia's central Government.</p>
['currency', 'biographical information']	<p>THE EURO SLIDES. The dollar rose against the euro after President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia dismissed Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin and his Government. In New York, the euro settled at $1.0712, down from $1.0756.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>A remote and rugged mountain region in southern Russia turned into a freshly opened war zone today as federal forces, including army units, opened fire from the ground and the air on Islamic militants who late last week occupied several villages along the border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya.</p> <p>Facing one of the most direct challenges to Moscow's authority in the troubled Caucasus region since the disastrous 1994-96 Chechen war, Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin arrived today in Dagestan, joining a lineup of top military and Interior Ministry commanders, including Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the Russian Army general staff.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia's assault on Chechen and Dagestani rebels in its southern republic of Dagestan is but one new chapter in the larger, bloodstained history of the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. As the Russians resume their centuries-old battle with Muslim warriors in the North Caucasus, many in the region believe they are also trying to destabilize Georgia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet states, to the south. These are strategically important countries, future conduits for large quantities of oil from the Caspian Sea. Their regimes are sufficiently unstable that it might not take much to topple them, especially if the West fails to pay sufficient attention.</p> <p>The Caucasus is Russia's Wild West; Russians have been fighting Caucasian Muslims since Cossacks entered the Terek River region on the Chechen-Dagestani border in the 16th century. For the Russians, the Caucasus, bordering Turkey and Iran, is both a defensive wall and a listening post that they are desperate to maintain.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>There was little debate and no drama in Parliament today as a majority of deputies voted swiftly, if grudgingly, to approve President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest nominee for Prime Minister, by a margin of 233 to 84.</p> <p>With their attention fixed on their own coming re-election campaigns, parliamentary leaders openly treated the confirmation of Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer selected by Mr. Yeltsin last week as his heir apparent, as a perfunctory duty that had to be performed before getting down to the real business of arranging campaign strategies.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Seated around the long table on the first floor of the modest dacha, the young men were relaxed, laughing a lot, talking excitedly, sometimes all together. They barely noticed as, guided by their chairman, I skirted the table and took a seat in a little room off their conference chamber to wait for a break in the proceedings. As I sat there, I marveled at the hilarity and occasional cacophony that fairly shook the wooden walls.</p> <p>It was October 1991; the Soviet Union still existed. Yet next door, this little band of brothers was writing the economic program for an independent Russia. When the chairman joined me and began to describe what they were doing, I could not at first take it in. We were seated in a dacha in a little colony of state dachas some 30 miles from Moscow. The scope of the task contrasted oddly with the participants' youth and high spirits. Something graver seemed called for -- a hushed conference hall with graybeards attended by aides, perhaps. This seemed so . . . light.</p>
['banks and banking', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>A top Kremlin official today denied corruption charges made in an Italian newspaper against members of President Boris N. Yeltsin's family and inner circle. The official dismissed the latest scandal as a fabrication ordered by Mr. Yeltsin's political enemies.</p> <p>The newspaper, Corriere della Sera, said on Wednesday that $1 million in ''pocket money'' for the Yeltsin entourage had been funneled in 1994 through a Swiss bank account held by Pavel P. Borodin, the powerful head of the Russian President's property management office. The newspaper quoted unidentified sources close to a Swiss investigation into bank accounts allegedly held by high-ranking Russian officials.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Three months after President Boris N. Yeltsin fired him as Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov made a dramatic re-entry into Russian politics today, this time as head of a new electoral alliance poised to assume a commanding lead in the coming election campaigns.</p> <p>The long-awaited decision by Mr. Primakov, whose popularity has thrived during a three-month-long silence, has already recast the shape of Russian public life as this vast and unwieldy country prepares for the post-Yeltsin era.</p>
['religion and churches', 'biographical information']	<p>Trying to reassure an anxious nation that it was not being drawn into a Chechnya-like quagmire, Russian commanders insisted today that Islamic militants dug in at remote mountain strongholds in the southern republic of Dagestan are already on the verge of defeat.</p> <p>After a week of fighting, commanders said Russian warplanes, helicopters and artillery have begun to decimate the rebels. Now, they insist, Russian troops are ferreting out the die-hards to destroy Shamil Basayev, the Chechen commander of the insurgents, and his band of rebels for good.</p>

['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>As Russian forces continued to battle Islamic militants in the mountains of the North Caucasus, Vladimir V. Putin, the newly designated Prime Minister, said today that he had proposed  a ''package of measures'' to bring the volatile situation under control.</p> <p>Emerging from a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, who yesterday anointed him as the Kremlin candidate in presidential elections next year, Mr. Putin, the former head of Russia's domestic intelligence service, said he hoped that the measures would quell the Islamic fundamentalist insurrection within weeks. He did not say what the measures were.</p>
['television', 'news and news media']	<p>If television is, as it increasingly seems to be, the weapon of choice in Russia's intense and ugly political battles, then Sunday night will offer Russian viewers, on two of the country's major channels, a journalistic rendition of ''Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.''</p> <p>ORT, Russia's largest TV channel, is controlled by Boris A. Berezovsky, a financier, media baron and close ally of President Boris N. Yeltsin. It will start a weekly news program whose host, Sergei Dorenko, is an anchorman with the reputation of an attack dog. He has in the past used his air time to tear political opponents to shreds.</p>

['crime and criminals', 'foreign aid']	<p>With President Clinton's top Russia expert testifying today before his toughest critic in the Senate about accusations of Russian corruption and possible American complicity, the advance billing promised a dramatic confrontation.</p> <p>But in the end, the exchange fizzled. The expert, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, sidestepped the sharpest queries of the critic, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who hurried Mr. Talbott away from the witness table in less than an hour,  after just one round of questions among six senators, to make room for a panel of specialists.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said here on Friday that a team of Russian law enforcement officials would arrive in Washington next week, in an effort to prove Moscow's eagerness to cooperate with American inquiries into money laundering.</p> <p>Mr. Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met for two hours at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-Operation forum Friday night, and Russian corruption and its effect on the international financial system were high on the agenda, an aide to Ms. Albright said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>American foreign policy toward Cuba is really unique among U.S. foreign policies. It isn't just 15 degrees off. It has the distinction of being 360 degrees wrong.</p> <p>That is, the longstanding U.S. boycott and isolation of Cuba is a failed policy if your desire is to punish Cuba's people so they will oust Fidel Castro, and it is a failed policy if your desire is to ease the pain on Cuba's people while they wait for Mr. Castro to pass away. It is a failed policy if you think we should be preparing for a post-Castro Cuba. And it is a failed policy if you think we should be trying to bring down Mr. Castro today. It is a failed policy if you believe in human rights, and it is a failed policy if you believe only in trade.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'international trade and world market', 'bombs and explosives', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>For five years now the Clinton Administration has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep countries from defaulting on loans to investors around the world, fearing that national bankruptcy can set off political upheaval and international economic chaos.</p> <p>That is why the White House bailed out Mexico in 1995, and why Washington moved the financial heavens to rescue Thailand and South Korea (successfully) and Indonesia and Russia (not exactly victories for American-style capitalism).</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances']	<p>In the last month, Russia has been through what people in other countries would call mayhem. A low-level war broke out on the southern border in Dagestan. Then came money-laundering investigations in the United States and Europe that have implicated high-ranking Kremlin officials. And in a two-week period, five terrorist bombings in Moscow and two other cities have left hundreds dead.</p> <p>But to foreign businesses, especially those that have been in Russia for several years, upheaval seems to be part of the landscape. Despite all these disturbances, foreigners trading and manufacturing in Russia have decided to stay put. Portfolio investors in the Russian stock market have been more skittish, but few have sold their holdings.</p>
['banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'finances', 'elections']	<p>The Clinton Administration learned of the Federal investigation into allegations of Russian money laundering at the Bank of New York five months earlier than it previously acknowledged, senior Administration officials said today.</p> <p>After insisting as recently as this morning that the Administration had learned of the investigation only last month after reading newspaper reports about it, the officials said the State Department and the White House's National Security Council were aware of the criminal inquiry in March, and that the Treasury Department learned of it in April.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin today mocked the Russian military's handling of an Islamic rebel invasion of Dagestan as inexcusably careless, joining a chorus of critics who say the nation's commanders appear to have learned nothing from their humiliating defeat by rebels in Chechnya three years ago.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, palpably angry, appeared on national television as his security council debated what to do about the rebels, who seized villages along the border with Chechnya over the weekend and blew up an apartment complex housing Russian military families.</p>
['banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>The former Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said today that accusations of Russian corruption and money-laundering had poisoned relations with the United States, and he urged political and business leaders in both countries to help keep the investigation from derailing the larger strategic relationship.</p> <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin, who was Prime Minister from 1992 to 1998, also defended Vice President Al Gore's leadership skills and insisted that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia was ''incapable'' of profiting from corruption. He said he could not vouch for members of Mr. Yeltsin's family, whose bank accounts in the Cayman Islands are under scrutiny by investigators and who have been accused of using credit cards provided by a Swiss construction company that did work for the Kremlin.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia has asked the United States Energy Department to expand joint projects aimed at securing dangerous materials, including nuclear fuel, that could be turned into weapons, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today on a visit here.</p> <p>Mr. Richardson said the proposal incorporated an unusual provision that would provide the United States greater access to highly sensitive sites to which Moscow has barred foreigners or permitted only limited entry. The offer, which Russian and American officials said was approved by Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev, was made by Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, Commander in Chief of the Russian Navy, at a private meeting today with Mr. Richardson and his senior staff.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>As Russian and international agencies struggled to keep up with the tide of Chechen refugees fleeing air strikes by Russian warplanes, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin refused today to rule out a possible ground war against the rebellious southern province.</p> <p>Mr. Putin also said that talks with the Chechen President, Aslan Maskhadov, were still possible but only if  Chechnya's elected leaders take a stand against the Islamic militants who have used Chechnya as a base for attacks against neighboring provinces, and are suspected of waging a terrorist campaign in Russia.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said tonight that Russian law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation into a suspected money laundering scheme involving Russian money at the Bank of New York, and asserted that the sums involved were far less than the billions of dollars reported.</p> <p>''The scope described in the press -- huge billions -- obviously doesn't correspond to reality but I repeat, the problem exists and we will work on it, without dramatizing it but without ignoring it,'' he said in a television interview.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Fleeing days of intensive air bombardment in Russia's war against Islamic militants, thousands of desperate refugees, their possessions piled atop cars and trucks, clogged the roads out of the breakaway republic of Chechnya today.</p> <p>More than 100,000 Chechens, and perhaps several times that, have  crossed the border into the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia in the last few days, officials said. The Ingush authorities appealed to Moscow for emergency assistance, including food and tents, and closed the border today.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Only hours after hearing Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.

['crime and criminals']	<p>In the Swiss investigation of possible Russian money laundering, the authorities have moved aggressively against two Swiss companies that worked for the Russian airline Aeroflot, where the powerful Moscow financier Boris A. Berezovsky had wielded considerable influence.</p> <p>This summer Swiss prosecutors raided the offices and froze the bank accounts of Andava S.A. and Forus Services S.A., two Lausanne companies that provided Aeroflot with cash management, loans and other financial services.

But many people from the Caucasus are now afraid to leave theirs.</p> <p>Literally overnight, the city's thousands of dark-complexioned natives of Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and other regions of the Caucasus Mountains, Muslim or Christian, have become suspects -- and potential scapegoats -- in Russia's reaction to the suspected bombings.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'ethics']	<p>Congressional Republicans ratcheted up their attack on President Clinton's Russia policy today, expanding the scope of hearings into the Russian banking scandal and Washington's dealings with Moscow.</p> <p>The House International Relations and Senate Foreign Relations committees announced that they would hold separate, wide-ranging hearings later this month about American policy toward Russia. The House Banking Committee said hearings it had previously announced would begin on Sept. 21 to examine allegations of Russian corruption and money-laundering, possibly including the diversion of billions of dollars in international aid.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'reform and reorganization', 'ethics']	<p>Responding to the scandal over alleged Russian money laundering, the Clinton Administration has offered two basic defenses of its Russia policy: 1) that it has long known about crime and corruption (Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott), and 2) that we must stay engaged with Russia for our national security (Samuel Berger, national security adviser). Both of these statements are true. So what is wrong with this picture?</p> <p>Of course the Administration has been aware of the crime and corruption and has known that this has been much more than mafia-type activity. It has known that ''reform'' was the entrenchment of a kleptocracy in which corrupt officials ally with a very few business magnates to send wealth out of the country.</p>
['bombs and explosives']	<p>The Russian police said today that they had determined that a 29-year-old Chechen man organized the recent spate of deadly bomb attacks in Moscow with the assistance of an Uzbek national, but they do not have either man in custody.</p> <p>The police said the Chechen, Achemes Gochiyayev, is the ringleader behind the attacks, which have killed about 280 people in less than three weeks. They identified the Uzbek as Denis Saitakov.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Russia has no plans to wage another war in its secession-minded Chechnya region to suppress Islamic militants who are mounting attacks from bases there, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said tonight.</p> <p>But at the same time, Mr. Putin said the Government has no intention of ceding anything to the Chechen militants, who have twice invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and are widely blamed for terrorist bombings that have killed hundreds in Moscow and the southern region of Rostov.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>The Clinton Administration, pressed by investigations into money laundering and capital flight out of Russia, is being forced anew to justify its policies of bold economic assistance to Moscow during the last seven years.</p> <p>This time the reassessment has raised questions of what the Administration knew about Russian corruption and what should have been done differently, officials said.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told President Clinton in a telephone conversation today that accusations linking Mr. Yeltsin and his family to a corruption inquiry were politically inspired, the White House said this evening.</p> <p>Samuel R. Berger, the President's national security adviser, said that Mr. Clinton specifically asked about reports that the Swiss authorities had evidence implicating Mr. Yeltsin and his family in taking bribes. The Swiss authorities were reported to have documents showing that Mr. Yeltsin's credit card bills and those of his two daughters had been paid by a construction company that did a great deal of renovation work on the Kremlin.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'ethics']	<p>Surprise, surprise: corruption has been rampant in the Kremlin.</p> <p>Swiss investigators are finding funny money in secret bank accounts of President Yeltsin's personal and official family members. In the U.S., the Bank of New York is being forced to explain the laundering of billions ripped off by favored oligarchs.</p>
['banks and banking', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>With the year 2000 bringing presidential elections in both the United States and Russia, the emerging scandal over the possible laundering of billions of dollars from Russia through the Bank of New York has, predictably, already prompted a politically tinged search for scapegoats. And in both countries, the leading culprits are the same -- the Democrats and the ''democrats.''</p> <p>In Russia, President Boris Yeltsin's administration, through inept governance and suspected corruption, has managed to give reform a bad name. The opposition, frustrated in its efforts to break Mr. Yeltsin's power, has taken to blaming ''democrats'' and their accomplices in the West for the country's many troubles.</p>
['banks and banking', 'economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>Recent allegations that American and European banks have facilitated money laundering for Russian organized-crime figures underscore how intractable a problem corruption in Russia is and how vulnerable Western institutions are to the lure of servicing the world's most virulent kleptocracy.</p> <p>Russia is hardly the first country to be victimized by a culture of corruption. The plundering of the Philippines under Marcos, the looting of Zaire by Mobutu and Indonesia's crony capitalism during the last years of Suharto stand as parallels. What sets Russia apart is the pervasiveness of politically tolerated corruption in a country of such size and geopolitical significance.</p>
['foreign aid', 'banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers today vigorously defended the Clinton Administration's policy of supporting aid to Russia, but warned that the Russian central bank had to comply with safeguards to maintain American backing for assistance.</p> <p>The conditions are not new. But taken together in the climate of a running Federal inquiry into allegations of Russian money laundering, they represent a new and hardening tone by an Administration official who, in July 1998, was the chief American architect of a multibillion-dollar loan to Russia from the International Monetary Fund to prop up the ruble. Within a month, however, President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his team of reformers and devalued the ruble.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Hopes faded today that the Security Council could agree this week on a new approach to Iraq, with the United States and Russia still far apart on how to monitor Iraqi weapons programs and on when -- or if -- to begin lifting sanctions.</p> <p>American and British officials said today that meetings would continue this week to explore compromises on outstanding issues like how to measure Iraqi cooperation and how much control the United Nations would have over money Iraq would earn if sanctions were suspended.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's military leaders have a simple explanation for the bombs raining down on Chechnya. They say they are copying NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia.</p> <p>From the fiery explosions at the Chechen republic's oil refineries to the attacks on the television station in Grozny, Russia's generals say they are taking their cues from NATO's tactics in the Balkans, which they opposed at the time.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, ended the bombing of Yugoslavia more than three months ago. But this week he was still waging a high-intensity battle to convince allied public opinion that the bombing had been as effective in Kosovo as he said it was last spring.</p> <p>Backed by almost a squadron of allied military pilots and about 20 linear feet of secret bound folders of bomb-damage assessment reports, he took his campaign to the stage of a NATO news briefing auditorium here today.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>The threat of terrorism spread to Russia's heartland today, as a huge explosion tore apart an apartment complex in Volgodonsk, in southern Russia, killing at least 18 people and leaving more than 200 wounded.</p> <p>The bombing, at 5:57 A.M., was the fifth in Russia in less than three weeks and underscored how vulnerable Russia remains to terrorist attacks, even with heightened security. Almost 280 people have died in the mysterious series of explosions.</p>
['foreign aid', 'crime and criminals', 'elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'ethics']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today criticized Russia's leaders for failing to combat corruption, but defended the Administration's policy of supporting aid to Russia.</p> <p>''We have made clear that we will not support further multilateral assistance to Russia unless fully adequate safeguards are in place,'' Ms. Albright said, in some of the Administration's sharpest remarks since an international investigation of money-laundering allegations surfaced last month. ''And we have always kept a close eye on our bilateral aid.''</p>

['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'bombs and explosives', 'war and revolution']	<p>This week, Russia showed that it can muster enough military clout to shield its southwestern flank, the remote republic of Dagestan, from invading rebels. The next question is whether it can afford to continue.</p> <p>By today, Russian forces had decisively driven thousands of Islamic extremist troops out of the mountains of central Dagestan -- for the second time in six weeks -- and back to bases inside neighboring Chechnya. Overnight, they launched air and artillery strikes against suspected guerrilla bases in the breakaway republic, military officials said, adding that Russian aircraft would fly up to 100 sorties by the day's end.</p>

The panel plans to explore how billions of dollars in Russian money flowed through the Bank of New York and how it was used.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'reform and reorganization', 'russia-international relations-us', 'ethics']	<p>This morning, the House Banking Committee is scheduled to open hearings on the Clinton Administration's Russia policy. This debate can be useful, indeed helpful, provided it takes into account three important factors.</p> <p>First, we must realize that the United States has a critical interest in Russia's stability and economic success and in its transition over time to a market democracy. Second, we must recognize the obstacles Russia faces in switching to a market economy. And third, we must realistically assess the choices the West faces, given the conditions in Russia and our own interests.</p>
['banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>The Federal investigation of money laundering at the Bank of New York is examining transactions with the bank by people close to President Boris N.

['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>Despite the acrimony between Congressional Republicans and the White House, the Clinton Administration emerged relatively unscathed in the past week after several days of hearings into allegations of Russian corruption and money laundering at the Bank of New York.</p> <p>The Republicans did not surface with ammunition that some had hoped could be used in the campaign season. ''I don't think there was anything that was startling, unexpected or particularly dramatic,'' Representative Rick A.

''Terrorism has declared war on the Russian people,'' President Boris N. Yeltsin said in a nationally televised address.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>''We go to bed wondering whether we are going to get up in the morning,'' Lyudmila Yegorova grimly said as she closed up her soft-drink and flower stand before heading home into a gray and soggy evening. ''What else can we do?''</p> <p>Mrs. Yegorova, 51, left for work this morning without listening to the news, so the first she heard of the latest bomb blast in Moscow was from her customers as they piled out of the Tsvetnoi Boulevard subway station on their way to work.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Islamic rebels continued their assault on Dagestan today, spurring fears that the Kremlin might lose control of the region.</p> <p>The Islamic militants have seized six villages in western Dagestan, including Novolakskoye. Fourteen Russian troops were killed on Sunday in fighting in that region.</p>
['public opinion', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>With his popularity ratings soaring, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin today hopped a 10-minute ride aboard a Sukhoi-25 fighter plane on a one-day tour of the war zone along the border of rebellious Chechnya.</p> <p>Two months after having been picked to head President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest Government, Mr. Putin has shot up in the rankings of potential presidential contenders, buoyed by broad public support for a military campaign aimed at crushing Islamic guerrillas who have made Chechnya their base.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'biographical information']	<p>Six years ago, a self-effacing Russian emigre with scant business experience set up a modest New Jersey company that planned to introduce entrepreneurs from the new Russia to American capitalists.</p> <p>Peter Berlin's venture, Benex International Company, got off to a slow start. But after a few years of  arranging shipments of stereos and other electronic products to Russia, Mr. Berlin hit on something simpler and more lucrative to move around the world: money.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian forces have expanded their operation in Chechnya, moving more troops in from the west, after seizing control of the entire northern part of the republic, Chechen commanders here said today.</p> <p>Chechen fighters have withdrawn from north of the Terek River, the last of them pulling out of the village of Naurskaya just before dawn today, said Apti Batalov, chief of the presidential administration in Grozny.</p>
['banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>It is three hours by air from Moscow to Omsk, a sprawling collection of fraying low-rises set on a Kansas-flat plain by the oil fields of Siberia. Every month or two, a well-dressed, bespectacled young man arrives by commercial jet here and is whisked away to a corporate apartment not far from the Omsk Oil Refinery, Russia's largest and most modern petroleum complex. After a day or two of unspecified business, he leaves as he came.</p> <p>Virtually nobody in this city of 1.2 million people would notice, except for his name: Leonid Dyachenko, the husband of President Boris N. Yelt sin's daughter and right-hand strategist, Tatyana Dyachenko.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops continued to move into Chechnya today, spurring speculation that the Kremlin may be planning a land offensive against the breakaway republic.</p> <p>So far, the troops have advanced only several miles into Chechnya, according to Russian commanders.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Chechnya's president vowed today to repulse a Russian invasion that he said had already started, adding that the fighting forces of his republic were united and far stronger than during  the two-year war that ended in 1996 and dealt a humiliating blow to Russia's once-proud army.</p> <p>''The war has begun,'' the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, declared to foreign journalists. Dressed in camouflage fatigues, he called for international pressure to end what he said was daily Russian bombing of villages and towns throughout his breakaway republic, and pleaded for just 30 minutes alone with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to avert full-scale war.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States and Russia, updating the ''hot line'' concept between leaders of the world's most heavily armed nuclear powers, opened a new state-of-the-art video-conferencing center today that will enable Russian and American nuclear officals to see, as well as talk, to each other during a nuclear-related emergency.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us', 'computers and the internet']	<p>Russia and the United States have agreed on the final details for a special command post in Colorado to insure that potential Year 2000 computer glitches in either nation's missile warning systems do not lead to an accidental launching of a nuclear warhead.</p> <p>After suspending cooperation to protest the United States bombing of Serbia last spring, Moscow relented and has agreed to cooperate on the command post at Peterson Air Force Base, in Colorado Springs, where Russian officers will sit side-by-side with American colonels to read data flowing in from American radar sites and satellites around the world.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>It was lunchtime on a clear sunny day today and the Russian artillery, positioned on the steep mountains to the east, was in action, pounding this village in southeastern Chechnya with several volleys of heavy missiles.</p> <p>The rumble of the rockets sounded across the valley, followed by another ripple on impact, which sent up  thick clusters of white smoke and, later, the frenzied crying of women after the body of one young man was brought in from the field.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The apartment blocks along Avturkhanov Street are a ghastly reminder of the last war here in Chechnya's capital. Most are abandoned ruins that still bear shrapnel marks and shell holes from the Russian bombardment four years ago.</p> <p>But even in the shell-pocked high-rises people have managed to rebuild some sort of life, patching the holes and repairing their apartments. Among the burned and smashed facades, a line of new windows glint or  a freshly painted balcony stands out. In places, brightly colored wash has been hung out to dry.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops continued to move within a few miles of the Chechen capital today, and a top federal military commander said the campaign had entered a new phase that would last as long as needed to defeat guerrillas fighting the Russian forces.</p> <p>Lieut. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, a commander in the Chechen campaign, said in an interview published today that Russia's military campaign had entered a second stage that could last ''three months or two years'' -- however long it takes to crush the guerrillas.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'ethics', 'biographical information']	<p>The American who brought consumer capitalism to Russia 40 years ago came back for a visit last week -- to the reports of bribery and money laundering, to the Mercedesful of impeccably suited thugs, to the political wars  among the lap-dog newspapers and television networks of too-wealthy tycoons, to the throngs of street urchins and dumpster-miners trampled in the stampede to wealth.</p> <p>All in all, he said, it could have been worse.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>The Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky suffered a setback today when his party was barred from participating in parliamentary elections in December.</p> <p>With his anti-American diatribes, Mr. Zhirinovsky has become well known for his strident nationalism. He reached the height of his influence in the early 1990's, when he emerged as the third-most-popular politician in Russia. In recent years, however, his popularity has waned as critics charged that his Liberal Democratic Party simply sold its votes to the highest bidder.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'atomic weapons', 'computers and the internet']	<p>The United States and Russia have quietly resolved a long-simmering dispute over the illegal sale of sophisticated I.B.M. computers to Russia's leading nuclear weapons lab, American officials said today.</p> <p>In the process both sides have helped open to cyberspace what was once one of the most secret installations of the Soviet Union.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Local men armed with Kalashnikov rifles moved quietly through the woods on the edge of this Chechen village today. Russian forces were  just 500 yards away, across the field and behind a line of trees, they said.</p> <p>Chechens were sitting in foxholes and trenches under the trees, softly calling greetings to each other. This is the front line, a dozen or so miles from the border in northwestern Chechnya, where the Chechens have held off Russian forces for two weeks.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States Embassy in Moscow has sharply curtailed the number of visas issued to Russians, particularly students and scholars, despite Washington's avowed desire to spread Western values in Russia.</p> <p>About 40 percent of Russian students who sought to study in the United States using private funds were refused visas this year, about twice the rejection rate of previous years. Embassy officials suggested that students from impoverished Russia -- potentially part of the country's opinion-making elite -- will be tempted to try to settle permanently in the United States.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>The most important story out of Russia last week was buried in the business pages: Russia's top stock-market watchdog quit after declaring that Boris Yeltsin's government was simply not interested in enforcing laws to protect shareholders in Russia.</p> <p>Imagine if you picked up the paper and found that Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had quit, saying that the New York stock exchange and our commercial courts were so corrupt that you were better off going to Las Vegas, and putting your money on red or black, than investing in the market.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In the dead of night, without lights, cars drove along a narrow track, over the Terek River and into a small village. Voices called a low greeting from the roadside. ''Allah-u-Akbar,'' the rallying cry of the Chechen forces. The men, quiet and serious, returned the greeting.</p> <p>Reinforcements of Chechen fighters were heading in Saturday night to strengthen the resistance to the Russian advance in northern Chechnya. After indicating last week that they were ceding the northern bank of the Terek River to the superior might of the Russians, the Chechens say they have retaken a number of villages like this one north of the river.</p>
['energy and power', 'elections', 'finances']	<p>Even by Russian standards, the power play last month at the top of Transneft, the country's fourth largest monopoly, was unusually nasty. In the highly charged atmosphere of Russia's yearlong election season, however, the battle was perhaps just the most public example of the fight between political clans over sources of power and money.</p> <p>On Sept. 14, the day after he was crudely and maybe illegally ousted as the general director of Transneft, the state-controlled oil pipeline monopoly, Dmitri Savelyev was called to an unusual meeting with Roman Abramovich, a young Russian oil baron and close friend of President Boris N. Yeltsin's family.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>An early autumn chill has already descended on the border regions around Chechnya, fast on the heels of fighting that has forced almost 200,000 Chechens to flee their homes as Russian troops bomb and strafe their breakaway republic.</p> <p>For Haji Zubarev and his extended family of 25 people, who fled the Chechen town of Sernovodsk two weeks ago, home is now an empty field here about a mile inside the Ingushetia side of the border. At night, when the temperatures drop, the men huddle for warmth on the back of an open truck, while the women gather in a beat-up van, bundling up their infants in layers of clothes.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'treaties']	<p>Speakers at a conference convened to press for ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty suggested today that the ban might founder among other holdouts, including Russia and China, if it was not approved by the United States Senate.</p> <p>The Clinton Administration and Senate Republicans have maneuvered all week in advance of the floor debate on the treaty that is scheduled to start Friday. Both sides agree that the ban faces near-certain defeat if it comes to a vote, so the main debate has been whether, and how, to postpone the vote -- and keep the treaty alive -- until next year.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Two Chechen sisters lay side by side in the Ninth City Hospital, barely able to talk.</p> <p>Their bodies were riddled with shrapnel wounds and stained green with disinfectant.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a move that could intensify the conflict in the northern Caucasus, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin today cut Moscow's last links with the elected government of the breakaway republic of Chechnya.</p> <p>For eight days, Russian planes have been bombing what it says are strongholds held by Islamic militants in Chechnya who have launched armed attacks against Russian territory. Moscow also says the militants have set off bombs that have killed almost 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches']	<p>Late on a sunny morning, the seven women lying shoulder-to-shoulder in Ward 1 of the Sunzhenskaya District Hospital grew quiet, turned inward, as doctors tended to the little girl in the corner.</p> <p>Several times a day, doctors come to change the dressings on three-year-old Patima Ablusheva's face and shell-pink hands. When she sees the doctors enter, she starts to cry. As they touch her and try to soothe her, telling her how good and brave she is, she begins to scream.</p>
['treaties']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin put off plans today to sign a unification treaty with Belarus, a political and diplomatic extravaganza that had been scheduled for Friday, after falling ill with what aides said was viral bronchitis.</p> <p>Outsiders immediately speculated that the illness was a pretext to delay the treaty, which is widely seen as a political coup for Belarus's autocratic president, Aleksandr Lukashenko, but a mixed blessing for Mr. Yeltsin and Russia.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Cherkessk may not be Chappaqua, but Boris A. Berezovsky, like Hillary Rodham Clinton, has also had to go house hunting far from home.</p> <p>Like Mrs. Clinton, Russia's most versatile tycoon needs a new political domicile for his latest act, a campaign for a seat in the Russian Parliament. With elections just a month away, he catapulted himself into Karachevo-Cherkessia this week, to the puzzlement of the 300,000 people who make up the multiethnic electorate of this tiny, neglected region in the unruly north Caucasus.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia has suggested for the first time that it might support a weapons inspection system for Iraq that would be acceptable to Western nations if Washington gave Moscow a free hand in Chechnya, administration officials said yesterday.</p> <p>The proposed link was contained in an informal document that Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov gave Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright during a meeting Wednesday of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in Istanbul. Administration officials seemed eager yesterday to reject even the possibility of such a deal.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>The Clinton administration is quietly reassessing whether to slow two major loan programs to Moscow as the war in Chechnya accelerates and the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination call for a cutoff of aid to Russia.</p> <p>In public, White House officials have said that they continue to favor modest economic support for the Yeltsin government, and that termination of the aid runs the risk of further destabilizing Russia before two major elections there. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, reiterated that position on Monday when he told reporters that despite the Russian military offensive in Chechnya, it would not ''make sense for us to affect'' a forthcoming loan from the International Monetary Fund, ''assuming the economic and transparency criteria are met.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'immigration and refugees', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian officials said today that they had largely driven Islamic rebels from Gudermes, the second-largest city in Chechnya, and in an unmistakable sign of their intention to retake complete control of the separatist republic, proposed to move the capital there from Grozny.</p> <p>The International Committee of the Red Cross underscored the deteriorating military situation by announcing that it is pulling its workers out of Chechnya to focus on helping refugees in Ingushetia, the republic to the west.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In Oslo the other day, the ex-K.G.B. man who is Russia's prime minister of the month delivered a letter from President Yeltsin to President Clinton:</p> <p>''Dear Bill,'' I am told it began, ''I would like to share with you, in confidence and with the utmost candor'' -- and then a Kremlin spokesman put out, in less confidence, the guts of the letter: that if the U.S. proceeded to mount any defense of its territory against nuclear missiles, ''it would have extremely dangerous consequences for the entire arms control process.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Capped in snow, the Shatili Mountains are fabled for their rugged beauty. These days they are also one of the Caucasus' more anxious borders.</p> <p>To the north is Chechnya, a brutal battleground for the Russian military. On the southern side of the mountain divide is Georgia, a former Soviet republic.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'terrorism', 'elections']	<p>The Yeltsin ''family'' and its new K.G.B. front man, Vladimir Putin, came up with a plan to regain popularity in the coming elections: Use foreign funds to build up the army and -- under the pretext of anti-terrorism -- exterminate the militant Chechens.</p> <p>So far, it's working. The Russian generals, humiliated by the independence forces five years ago, are using new tactics that inflict civilian casualties with missiles and artillery. Controlled media show victories, not 200,000 pitiful Chechen refugees or Russian body bags. The Yeltsin-Putin party's popularity is soaring.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Mikhail V. Margelov has had his share of challenging assignments: assisting the K.G.B., working for the government press agency Tass, and then, in 1996, helping to produce the ads for President Boris N. Yeltsin's come-from-behind campaign. His new job tops them all: selling Russia's war in Chechnya to the public.</p> <p>Taking a page out of NATO's book during its bombing of Yugoslavia, which was highly unpopular in Russia, and a lesson from the Chechen rebels during Chechnya's last war in 1994-96, Russia has established a center to organize news coverage of the Chechen conflict. As director of this operation, Mr. Margelov, 34, is trying to bring Western public relations to a military that once scorned public opinion.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia sought today to cut off Chechnya from the outside world by banning foreign trade with the breakaway republic and suspending international flights to the region.</p> <p>Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said the measures are needed to stop arms smuggling and to prevent Islamic terrorists from flocking to the northern Caucasus region.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>At a meeting here today with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Clinton expressed strong concern over the Russian air and artillery bombing of Chechnya and the suffering of civilians in the breakaway region, a senior administration official said.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton urged the Russian to move toward a ''political dialogue'' or risk serious damage to his country's international reputation, the official said. Mr. Putin was in Oslo, along with Mr. Clinton, to attend ceremonies for the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>This was supposed to be a banner day for American-Russian cooperation. The American ambassador was scheduled to cut the ribbon at a gala opening of a United States-financed business center in one of Russia's closed nuclear cities.</p> <p>But after Russian authorities barred him last week from bringing his top science adviser or inspecting other American-Russian projects at the site, known as Krasnoyarsk-26, Ambassador James F. Collins angrily canceled his visit.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>When President Clinton met yesterday with Vladimir  Putin, the Russian Prime Minister, to convey concerns about the 200,000 refugees fleeing Russia's attack on Chechnya, he was addressing a part of the world where there is a wider American interest.</p> <p>Nearby, Armenia's internal balance is shaken after five armed men burst into its Parliament last week and killed the prime minister. That attack set back negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed province that led the two countries to a bloody war from 1988 to 1994. As Chechnya burns, tiny, impoverished Georgia could be overwhelmed with Chechen refugees.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Barely 24 hours after President Clinton and other Western leaders confronted President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia at a meeting in Turkey, condemning his actions in Chechnya, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas went them one better today, calling for an end to international aid to Moscow unless the Russian government stops ''killing women and children.''</p> <p>''We cannot excuse Russian brutality,'' Mr. Bush said this morning in the first major foreign policy speech of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. ''When the Russian government attacks civilians, it can no longer expect aid from international lending institutions.''</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>What the United States hoped would be a quick and painless renewal of the program under which Iraq sells limited amounts of oil to pay for goods to relieve civilian hardships turned today into complicated negotiations when Russia proposed changes favorable to Iraq.</p> <p>The extension of the ''oil for food'' program for another six months requires Security Council action by the end of the week. American diplomats hoped that approval would be more or less automatic, so that the council could concentrate on the larger issue of agreeing on a new arms inspection system for Iraq.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Two specters hang over the summit meeting that is bringing more than 50 world leaders to Istanbul this week.</p> <p>One is the war raging in Chechnya, where Russia's campaign to crush a separatist rebellion has prompted sharp Western criticism of the devastating impact on civilians.</p>
['elections']	<p>In a broadside that typifies the tone of the campaign before Russia's parliamentary elections next month, a billboard advertisement appeared in central Moscow in the middle of the night recently congratulating Yevgeny M. Primakov, the former prime minister, on his 70th birthday: it showed a wheelchair.</p> <p>Since Mr. Primakov is allied with Moscow's powerful mayor, the jab was the political equivalent of a  guerrilla strike into the enemy camp.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'freedom and human rights', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>When President Clinton's foreign policy team gathered in the White House to discuss Chechnya recently, briefers from the Central Intelligence Agency explained the Russian military strategy in detail.</p> <p>It boiled down to this: continued artillery and aerial bombardment of the breakaway republic; the destruction of the capital, Grozny, in an effort to flush out rebels, and the creation of even more civilian casualties and refugees, who are already spreading chaos through the Caucasus.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>More than 60 Russian SS-21 missiles and scores of Scuds have ripped into the civilian populace in the capital of Chechnya, as the Red Army seeks vengeance for its humiliating defeat by independence-minded guerrillas five years ago.</p> <p>This time the generals calling the shots have Russian public opinion on their side. Chechen terrorists struck into a neighboring state loyal to Russia and are also widely believed to be behind murderous bombings in Russian cities. The average Russian wants to get even.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Envoys of the five major powers at the United Nations ended several weeks of talks yesterday without agreeing on how to restart arms inspections in Iraq, diplomats said.</p> <p>The discussions will now go back to foreign ministers to resolve differences, while the Russians prepare to discuss the issue with the Iraqis next week. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and the government official responsible for dealing with the United Nations, is expected to arrive in Moscow early in the week for talks.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>The administration said today that it might go ahead with a national missile defense system, even if it meant withdrawing from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty over Russian objections.</p> <p>''We will not permit any other country to have a veto on actions that may be needed for the defense of our nation,'' Walter B. Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, said today in a speech at the Center for Strategic International Studies.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After two months of steady advances into Chechnya's heartland, the Russian military said today that it is beginning to encounter serious resistance from Islamic militants, and that the fighting is likely to intensify in the next few weeks.</p> <p>''The resistance is growing day by day,'' Col. Gen. Georgi I. Shpak, the commander of Russia's airborne troops, said in an interview.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Western debate over Russia's assault on Chechnya has been largely polarized, with Russophobes crying genocide and Islamophobes warning about Muslim terrorists. But the attitudes of Chechen refugees whose lives have been upended by the war are far more nuanced, and may yield some insight into achieving a lasting peace.</p> <p>There are two main story lines to the Chechen tragedy of the 1990's. The obvious one has been the ruthlessness with which the Russians have twice intervened militarily. Just as important, however, has been the collapse in Chechnya of the institutions of modern statehood -- law enforcement, schools, hospitals, courts -- since the national revolution of 1991. This disintegration was caused in large part by war, but it also owes a great deal to the Chechens' historical resistance to any superior authority and their traditional tolerance for what we would now regard as banditry.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>One of Russia's most prominent businessmen has been detained in Hungary at the request of Russian law enforcement officials.</p> <p>Russian officials said today that Anatoly Bykov, an aluminum factory chief from Siberia, had been apprehended recently by Hungary's border police. The Russian authorities have opened a criminal investigation of Mr. Bykov's finances and are seeking his extradition.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'computers and the internet']	<p>The State Department is planning to withdraw hundreds of government employees and family members from Russia and three other former Soviet republics before Jan. 1 because of concerns over the Year 2000 computer problem.</p> <p>Experts at the American Embassy in Moscow, however, have concluded that there is virtually no risk to diplomats from the computer problem, although there may be some disruption in telephone communication and electrical power in Russia.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a fresh sign that the Russian military plans to bombard Grozny, the Chechen capital, into submission, the government said today that it would open a safe passage for desperate civilians to flee.</p> <p>The city has come under a withering assault for days. While Russian officials said the government's move was intended to reduce civilian casualties, it also appears to be intended to mute Western criticism that Russia is inflicting more harm on its own citizens in Chechnya than on the Islamic militants against whom it has been waging a war for nine weeks.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Busloads of desperate refugees poured out of Chechnya today, as Russia opened the border after Western criticism that it was needlessly endangering civilians.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of civilians have been stranded on the Chechen side of the border, as women, children and the elderly have fled the Russian bombardment of Chechnya. Moscow, which began a military campaign against the breakaway region in September, had effectively sealed the border for almost two weeks. The Russian decision to admit the refugees -- who have been living in the open, often without food or water, as temperatures have plummeted -- comes as Western observers have stepped up their criticism of the Yeltsin government's handling of the crisis.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>As Russian armies surround, bombard and flatten Grozny, only one party has a chance of winning this conflict, and only because it cannot lose: the Chechen fighters. Either they will halt the Russian offensive and create a stalemate, or they will retreat into the mountains and come back to fight another day.</p> <p>The losers? They include the Chechen civilians trapped in this brutal conflict; Russia, which continues to fight a war it cannot win, and, if it tries to affect the war's outcome, the United States. Indeed, the Chechnya war underscores the limits on the ability of great powers like Russia and the United States to shape the outcome of local conflicts going on in the world.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>One of the Russian military's first serious forays into Chechnya's besieged capital, Grozny, went disastrously awry late Wednesday after thousands of Chechen rebels surrounded the invading troops and pounded them with rocket-propelled grenades.</p> <p>Correspondents at the battle scene, a square near central Grozny, said the area was littered with blazing armored vehicles and the bodies of Russian soldiers. A Reuters correspondent, Maria Eismont, said she counted more than 100 Russian dead at the end of the three-hour battle.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Irina Venyaminova, who runs a family-owned leather workshop in the center of this southern Russia city, has no great desire to vote on Dec. 19, when Russia elects a new Parliament.</p> <p>Neither does Andrei Myakinnikov, who like Irina started his own company in the early 1990's, just as the dust was settling from the collapse of the old Soviet state economy.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'elections', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott ended two days of talks on a sour note here today, accusing Russia of ''indiscriminate killing'' in Chechnya and failing to break a lingering stalemate between Washington and Moscow over a major arms control treaty.</p> <p>As Russian forces continue to pound rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Mr. Talbott offered some of the harshest American criticism to date of the Kremlin's military campaign, which proved enormously popular in the parliamentary elections last week. He said Russia was violating ''international norms'' in Chechnya by treating civilians in Chechnya as ''terrorists.''</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>As Russia's chief representative in Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman has seen plenty of hardship. But he was visibly troubled by what he saw in Alkhan-Yurt, a village near Grozny that residents say was pillaged by Russian troops.</p> <p>''I swear that I have not seen anything like this in Chechnya,'' Mr. Koshman exclaimed.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Seven journalists were stopped yesterday as they drove through Chechnya, and then taken by helicopter to a Russian military base, where they were held for nine hours before being released.</p> <p>It was unclear if the journalists, six of whom were accredited in Moscow, would be permitted to remain in the Caucasus.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'elections', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Senator John McCain sharpened his call today to cut off all aid to Russia as the war in Chechnya escalated, and he accused the Clinton administration of turning a blind eye to Russian corruption and complicity in failed assassination plots against the leaders of two former Soviet republics.</p> <p>In a wide-ranging foreign policy address, Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican running for his party's presidential nomination, also criticized European allies for drifting away from NATO to develop a separate defensive alliance. And while supporting China's entry into the World Trade Organization, he warned that its leaders were ''ruthless defenders'' of an ''inhumane'' regime.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Russian government backed away today from an ultimatum that civilians leave the Chechen capital of Grozny by Saturday or face a deadly bombardment.</p> <p>Russian warplanes dropped thousands of leaflets over Grozny in recent days, urging residents to use any means possible to escape the city before Dec. 11.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>Last week, it was the Islamic rebels who held this rustic settlement, only two and a half miles from the outskirts of Grozny, the Chechen capital. Their fortified trenches, the deepest Russian soldiers have seen here, edged the fields and stretched along the railroad tracks leading from the city.</p> <p>But as Russian troops rushed to encircle Grozny, the outnumbered rebels were routed in a furious 10-hour firefight. Russian gunships and artillery pounded the trenches, illumined by countless flares and backed by armored combat vehicles and tanks, until the surviving Chechens fled to Grozny through a covering fog.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>A new arms inspection plan that could lead to the suspension of nine years of sanctions against Iraq sometime next year may go to the Security Council for debate on Wednesday, Western diplomats said today. British and American envoys, augmented by State Department officials, spent today trying to build a consensus that would avoid a Russian veto.</p> <p>Diplomats said that on Wednesday that the foreign ministers of key Security Council countries, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia, would discuss the proposals by telephone.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'reform and reorganization', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russian officials reacted angrily today to Western condemnation of their military tactics in Chechnya, warning that threats to impose sanctions or interrupt aid are unacceptable.</p> <p>Several officials insisted that Russia was feeling the effects of the criticism through a decision by the International Monetary Fund to postpone the delivery of a $640 million credit.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Facing heavy resistance from rebels in Chechnya, the Russian military conceded today that the fighting there could drag on for at least several more months.</p> <p>''It will take at least two to three months to complete the liquidation of scattered and, unfortunately, very numerous terrorist bands,'' Col. Gen. Valery L. Manilov, a senior officer on the Russian General Staff, told reporters today.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The United States will not seek to block economic aid to Russia as punishment for that country's widely condemned campaign against separatist rebels in Chechnya, a Clinton administration official said today.</p> <p>The official, speaking after Russia won the release today of a $100 million loan from the World Bank, said  aid packages to Russia from the United States, the World Bank or its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, would be considered on a case-by-case basis. But he said the Clinton administration would not apply a umbrella political standard when reviewing aid programs and has no plans to cut off aid in general as a way of punishing Russia for its military campaign in Chechnya.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>After interviewing refugees from the fighting in Chechnya, an international human rights group said today that Russian troops had pillaged a small village there this month and killed 17 civilians.</p> <p>The group, Human Rights Watch, said it had conducted interviews with 15 survivors and that the killings took place in the village of Alkhan-Yurt, a settlement 10 miles southwest of the Chechen capital, Grozny, which has been the scene of fierce fighting.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin returned today from an official visit to Beijing sounding more like a recidivist Soviet premier than a president, having rattled Russia's nuclear saber at President Clinton on Wednesday and having denounced American culture, values and military dominance before leaving Beijing this afternoon.</p> <p>But more intriguing, perhaps, is what Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin was doing in Moscow while he was gone.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The European Union today accepted Turkey as a candidate for membership, reversing a thumbs-down vote two years ago, which was based mainly on Turkey's human rights record.</p> <p>Membership, which is probably many years down the road, would mark the entry of the first Muslim country to the European Union. Turkey, which has long sought closer ties to Europe, is already a member of NATO.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe urged Russia and Islamic rebels today to agree to a cease-fire in Chechnya. But his plea was ignored, and Russia continued its heavy shelling of Grozny, the Chechen capital.</p> <p>''I have made an appeal for a cease-fire, and if there is an attack on Grozny, I have not been answered,'' the official, Kurt Vollebaek, told reporters here today. ''On the contrary, they are doing just the opposite of what I asked for.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Hours before the Security Council was to vote today on a new arms-inspection system for Iraq, France suddenly asked to stop the clock, stunning council members and irritating some by calling for more talks on a resolution that had been under discussion for more than six months.</p> <p>A United Nations official described the move as tragic, coming as it did just after Russia's deputy representative here, Gennadi Gatilov, told reporters that Russia would abstain, thereby removing the threat of veto from a measure that could send arms inspectors back to Iraq for the first time in a year.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Moscow's embattled and combative Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov held a rally at the foot of the Kremlin tonight, under the nose of opponents who for weeks now have been orchestrating his political hanging.</p> <p>With five days to go before an election in which he is running both as mayor and as a leader of an anti-Kremlin parliamentary bloc, Mr. Luzhkov told tens of thousands of people, most of them city workers mobilized by pro-Luzhkov trade unions, that he would take his fight against President Boris N. Yeltsin and his entourage to the finish.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>After two days of fighting in the streets of Grozny, the Russian military conceded tonight that its troops were meeting strong opposition as they struggled to seize control of the Chechen capital from Islamic rebels.</p> <p>''The advance of the Russian troops is very difficult,'' the Russian Defense Ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency. ''Practically at all crucial points the the rebels have established strong positions.''</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'religion and churches', 'crime and criminals']	<p>A hijacked Indian jetliner with 155 hostages on board remained in a perilous limbo on a tarmac in Afghanistan yesterday as efforts to end the crisis on its third day bogged down in a swirl of recriminations and charges that seemed to reprise the bitter, decades-old feud between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.</p> <p>Pakistan accused India of staging the hijacking. India hinted that Pakistan might be behind it. Officials of the Taliban, who control most of Afghanistan, said they would not negotiate with the hijackers. And while Russia called for a meeting of the United Nations Security Council, India signaled that it did not want international mediation.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A few days before the United Nations Security Council is expected to vote on a new arms inspection system for Iraq, the Iraqi government threatened France yesterday with retaliation against its diplomats and oil companies if it supports the proposal.</p> <p>The government of Saddam Hussein apparently senses that it can no longer rely on France -- and perhaps not on Russia either -- to block the resumption of inspections after a year of indecision by the Security Council and no monitoring in Iraq. So  Iraq has gone on the offensive with articles in its controlled press and with comments from officials.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russian officials said today that they had caught an American spy as she was preparing to meet with her Russian informant and confiscated an array of sophisticated espionage equipment.</p> <p>The Clinton administration acknowledged that an American diplomat had been briefly detained in Moscow in an ''incident,'' but declined to comment on Russian charges that the diplomat was a spy.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Not long ago, whenever Boris N. Yeltsin caught a cold, the more nervous Kremlin watchers in the Clinton administration reacted with alarm. But this week, Mr. Yeltsin caught pneumonia, and Washington stifled a yawn.</p> <p>That casual response offers a revealing glimpse of how Washington apparently believes that Mr. Yeltsin's health is no longer critical to the relationship with Moscow.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Her husband walked through mushy snow, still in his thick brown knit sleeping shirt, to vote early in Russia's parliamentary elections today, but Mariya Chashena, 78 and feeling stiff, was in no shape to get out. So this afternoon a delegation of election officials trudged to her minuscule second-story walkup and stood sardined in the kitchen as she sat beneath a yellowed poster of Russia's czars, and committed democracy.</p> <p>''Medved! The bear means wealth,'' she declared, and marked a big ''X'' on a ballot next to an emblem of a prowling bear. An official held out a battered gray suitcase, fishing line wrapped around it to prevent tampering, and she stuffed her choices through a slot cut in the top, next to the handle.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'war and revolution']	<p>Mikhail A. Kashpurin is a frail old man with years of valorous service in the Soviet Army, an unblemished labor record and a story to tell.</p> <p>And that story is this: He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place was Grozny, and the time was Russia's military campaign.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'currency', 'finances']	<p>After weathering a year of debt defaults, a currency crash, an absentee president and governments that change with the seasons, Russians have one piece of good news: The economy has not collapsed.</p> <p>In the months after the August 1998 crash of the stock market and the ruble, and the appointment of a Government heavy with ardent Communists, many analysts feared a return to fixed prices, shortages of consumer goods and a ceaseless printing of rubles that would have once more ignited hyperinflation. ''It was all lined up for catastrophe, and it just didn't happen,'' said James Fenkner, equities strategist for the Moscow brokerage firm Troika Dialog.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>An unexpectedly strong showing by pro-government parties in Russian parliamentary elections on Sunday appeared likely to give President Boris N. Yeltsin a more compliant legislature as he heads into his last six months in office. It also gives his designated heir, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, a firm launching pad for the presidency.</p> <p>Surveys of voters leaving the polls indicated that the Communist Party, the bulwark of the anti-Yeltsin opposition, could still emerge as Russia's largest single party, with about 25 percent of the vote, cast on the basis of party lists that will fill half of the 450 seats in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. The Communists are expected to pick up more seats in the 225 single districts, where final results will be known only later this week.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Hundreds of stone towers, some nearly 1,000 years old, dot the jagged cliffs of the Caucasian mountain range in Chechnya. One of the region's prized symbols, they have survived through earthquakes, wars and the deportation of the Chechen people in 1944, but Chechens fear that the towers are now threatened by Russian bombing in the region's second war in five years.</p> <p>''I don't know how any of the towers can survive such bombing,'' said Lecha Ilyasov, 38, a philologist and photographer who lived in Russia most of his life before returning to Chechnya two years ago to document its culture.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Shortly before Russians across nine time zones vote for a new Parliament, Yevgeny M. Primakov, the former prime minister and leader of an anti-Kremlin electoral bloc, announced today that he would be a candidate for president in the election scheduled for June.</p> <p>Mr. Primakov, 70, previously said he would not decide on a bid for Russia's top job until after the parliamentary elections on Sunday.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright  ordered the Export-Import Bank today to reject a $500 million loan for Russia ''for the time being, '' arguing that the state-affiliated oil company that would receive it is an example of resistance to economic reform.</p> <p>After a day of frantic meetings in which Dr. Albright tried unsuccessfully to persuade the independent agency to defer consideration of the loan guarantees, she invoked a rarely used law to block the loan.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'elections', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>His domestic base cemented by Sunday's parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin signaled today that he wants to mend relations with the West by calling for ratification of the six-year-old Start II nuclear arms treaty.</p> <p>Mr. Putin pressed for approval of the accord in a meeting with leaders of the newly elected Parliament, as  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott arrived here for talks on arms control and other issues.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After the Allies' first successes against German forces in Egypt in World War II, Winston Churchill told the British Parliament that this was not the end of the war, not even the beginning of the end, but it might just be the end of the beginning.</p> <p>The Russia scholar Leon Aron says the same today of Russia in the wake of its latest parliamentary elections. The fact that key centrist and reform-minded parties emerged from these elections with a chance to control the Russian legislature for the first time is not the end of Russia's wrenching transition to free-market democracy, says Mr. Aron. It's not even the beginning of the end of that transition. But it may mark the end of the beginning of Moscow's tumultuous move away from Communism.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>BP Amoco P.L.C., one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, has tentatively reached an agreement with a Russian oil company to resolve a long-running conflict that threatened to destroy the petroleum giant's half-billion-dollar investment in the country, people close to the negotiations said today.</p> <p>Under the deal, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, BP Amoco would regain authority over a prized Siberian oil field sold in a questionable bankruptcy auction to the Russian company, Tyumen Oil.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>On its face, it is no great shakes that Russia's sixth-biggest oil company, Sibneft, unveiled a spiffy new green-and-blue logo in April. What makes it a symbolic symbol indeed is the logo's two flavors: traditional Cyrillic, for Russians -- and English, for most everyone else.</p> <p>For an industry that has exemplified this nation's hand-on-the-throat style of business, there may be no better metaphor. Russia's oil tycoons largely founded their empires through dark-of-night political deals and squeezing out competitors, and until lately they have run their companies pretty much the same way.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>Russia issued an ultimatum on Monday to the citizens of Chechnya's capital -- leave before Saturday or die. True, after stern words from the United States and the rest of the world, Russia backed off one day later. But yesterday President Boris Yeltsin was rattling his saber again, this time issuing an ominous reminder to President Clinton that Russia ''has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons.''</p> <p>Such bluster deserves a quick and firm response. But the Clinton administration, in typical fashion, is waffling. Although the president himself warned earlier this week that Russia would pay ''a heavy price'' for its conduct in Chechnya -- the warning that apparently ignited Mr. Yeltsin's outburst -- Mr. Clinton has been unwilling to put the teeth in that rhetoric.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Clinton administration has made ''impressive strides'' in preventing former Soviet scientists from working for rogue states and terrorists seeking unconventional weapons, but it should spend much more to achieve that aim, a Washington research group said yesterday.</p> <p>''Given the consequences of the chemical and biological brain drain,'' says a report issued by the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, ''sound argument can be made for at least doubling the amount of money going annually into collaborative research grants for biological weaponeers, and at a minimum tripling the grant funds for chemical weapons scientists.''</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin, bristling over President Clinton's criticism of Russia's military assault on Chechnya, complained today that the United States was not treating Russia with the respect due a nuclear power.</p> <p>''President Clinton permitted himself to put pressure on Russia,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, loudly and deliberately, in front of television cameras after he arrived here today for a day and a half of meetings with Chinese leaders. ''It seems he has for a minute forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, standing in for President Boris N. Yeltsin at a Kremlin ceremony, said tonight that Russia's ''national pride'' was at stake in the war to retake rebellious Chechnya.</p> <p>Mr. Putin, the Kremlin's favored candidate in the presidential race next summer, said Russia was duty bound to crush the rebels after their ''brazen and impudent'' invasion of a neighboring region in August.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Crowning years of negotiations  and, many say, calculated delay -- Russia and Belarus agreed in principle today to form an economic and political confederation modeled roughly after the European Union.</p> <p>But even after a glittering Kremlin ceremony to confirm the accord, and official predictions that the union could lead to a larger and revitalized Slavic compact, it seemed doubtful that Russian leaders would carry out many of the alliance's grand designs soon, if ever.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The newly emboldened Russian military has now embarked on a modern version of what Rudyard Kipling in 1901 called ''the Great Game'' -- that struggle against the West for economic and political power in the Caucasus and Middle East.</p> <p>A war on terrorism out of Chechnya is its excuse. Next week's elections to the Russian Parliament are the immediate cause of the systematic massacre of the dark-skinned Muslim troublemakers. The blood-thirstiest of the Russian politicians are getting the most support, if we can believe the easily rigged polls.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The brutish war in Chechnya is alternately portrayed as Russian troops' trying to put down ''terrorists'' or freedom-loving Islamic rebels' seeking to throw off Russian domination. But there are no heroes in Znamenskoye.</p> <p>The Russians have forced their way into this town in northwest Chechnya, but they have also brought a measure of stability, townspeople say. The militants may include Chechen patriots, they add, but they also have among them thieves and adventurers from the Middle East.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>If you think it's easy being a pro-Western, pro-market politician in Russia these days, get an earful of the first question asked Anatoly M. Chubais during a radio interview this week.</p> <p>''There is a widespread attitude,'' the interviewer said, ''that you have brought the country to the point of collapse -- taken the economy to an extreme, 'done animal experiments,' that you are 'laboratory scientists who do not know what life is,' that you have 'with the cruelty of vivisectors' pushed millions of people beyond the poverty line. Why should people vote for you?''</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>White House officials called today on the independent Export-Import Bank of the United States to delay or cancel a pending $500 million loan package to Russia.</p> <p>The officials said the aid, in the form of loan guarantees to a Russian oil company for the purchase of American equipment, should be blocked because of allegations that the Russian company had defrauded foreign investors in another deal.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Clinton administration asked the Export-Import Bank of the United States today to delay $500 million in aid to a Russian oil company as a protest over continued resistance to economic reforms and, more obliquely, to step up pressure to end the military campaign in Chechnya.</p> <p>But the chairman of the bank, James A. Harmon, said tonight that he had not yet received any communications from the State Department and that he expected that the board of the independent agency would probably reject such a request, which he argued was based on an extremely loose reading of the law.</p>
['elections']	<p>Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, newly confirmed in the parliamentary elections as Russia's current political hero for his tough conduct of the war in Chechnya, signaled today that he was now prepared to put his stamp on domestic issues -- to meet voters' demands, as he said, for ''new results, new ideas and new solutions.''</p> <p>In effect, Mr. Putin, 47, opened up the second stage of a Kremlin campaign that has already made him a clear favorite -- at least for now -- to succeed President Boris N. Yeltsin in elections set for June.</p>
['elections']	<p>If the West believes that Russia's parliamentary elections were a strong vote for democracy and market reform, it is deluding itself.</p> <p>The elections on Sunday were indeed a remarkable victory for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who revealed he has long political coattails. His endorsement late last month of the Unity bloc, a diverse coalition concocted by the Kremlin in the last three months of the campaign, propelled it from single-digit poll ratings to a second-place finish, behind the Communists, with nearly a quarter of the vote.</p>
['terrorism', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>The West has long seen the development of democracy in Russia as a check against the Kremlin's military ambitions and a way to bridge the political divide between East and West.</p> <p>But consider the results of Russia's parliamentary elections: millions went to the polls and demonstrated their support for the war in Chechnya, despite its apparent brutality, by voting for candidates backed by Vladimir V. Putin, the hawkish prime minister closely associated with the war.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The race for Russia's third Parliament since the end of the Soviet Union, to be chosen Sunday in a marathon 23 hours of voting, was less a campaign than a barroom brawl, a chairs-over-the-head affair suffused with slander, manipulation and unvarnished peculiarity on all sides.</p> <p>Yet it was also a race that the public took seriously, despite its disgust at the tactics. Between the opening of the first polling booths at 8 a.m. local time Sunday in Russia's Far East and the closing of the last, 11 time zones to the west, in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, as many as 80 percent of the 107 million eligible voters are expected to cast ballots for the Duma, as the lower house of Parliament is called.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In an effort to block the southern escape routes for Islamic rebels in Chechnya, Russian paratroopers have cut the road between the breakaway region and Georgia, its neighbor to the south.</p> <p>Georgian officials reported that Russian helicopters had dropped bombs on the Georgian side of the border in an apparent effort to seal the border, and President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia vowed a response. The paratroopers were flown in by helicopter and have taken up positions inside Chechnya, but near the Georgia border.</p>
['television', 'public opinion', 'news and news media']	<p>The refugees were nowhere to be found. But that did not fluster Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations and the leader of a Kremlin-backed party in parliamentary elections next weekend.</p> <p>Zipped up in a natty red jacket, Mr. Shoigu led a caravan of journalists from this checkpoint on the Chechnya-Ingushetia border to a small town near the outskirts of Grozny, the Chechen capital.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'espionage']	<p>The two espionage cases that are causing so much finger-pointing in Washington are indeed disturbing, but it's also dangerous to read too much into them.</p> <p>The cases of Wen Ho Lee, the nuclear engineer who was indicted on Friday on charges of improperly handling classified information at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Stanislav Grusev, a Russian Embassy employee who was expelled from the United States last week after an electronic bug was discovered at the State Department, raise all sorts of questions about how seriously we take our national security.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian soldiers battled their way toward the center of Grozny today as the struggle for control of Chechnya's capital entered an even fiercer phase.</p> <p>After a thunderous bombardment, Russian troops began moving through Grozny's streets at dawn. It was the most intense ground attack on the capital of the rebellious province of Chechnya in nearly four months of fighting.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>The political party most closely associated with Acting President Vladimir V. Putin unexpectedly joined forces with the Communists today to re-elect the Communist speaker of the Russian Parliament's lower house.</p> <p>The unexpected maneuver blocked two former prime ministers, Yevgeny M. Primakov and Sergei V. Stepashin, from a chance to lead the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, and prompted a furious walkout by more than 100 deputies in protest against what one described as a ''a cynical backroom deal,'' and another as a ''political farce.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia took the lead today in marshaling a growing opposition to Secretary General Kofi Annan's nomination of a chief arms inspector for Iraq. The opposition suggested protracted battles to come, not only over that appointment, but also over other steps toward resuming the monitoring of Iraqi weapons.</p> <p>France and China joined the Russians in objecting to the nomination of Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish disarmament expert who established the first inspection system in Iraq after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, as the executive chairman of a new commission created in December. The three want the nomination process reopened so that someone more acceptable to Iraq can be found.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>The Kremlin offered today what it called proof that militants in Chechnya masterminded terrorist bombings last fall at several Russian apartment houses: a video tour of a Chechen bomb factory.</p> <p>The film of the factory, which officials said contained explosives identical to those used in the bombings, appeared to offer circumstantial evidence at best that the militants were behind the blasts. But the secretary of the Russian government's security council, Sergei Ivanov, said Russian forces were seeking two individuals in Grozny and in rebel-held southern Chechnya who they believe are tied to the crimes.</p>
['finances', 'ethics', 'credit']	<p>A construction magnate at the center of accusations of a kickback scandal involving former Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and his family acknowledged today that he helped supply the family with credit cards.</p> <p>But the executive, Beghjet Pacolli, whose company had major construction contracts in Russia in the 1990's, including renovating the Kremlin, said he gave only an international financial guarantee for the Russian bank that issued the credit.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>After four months of war in the north Caucasus, serious doubts have been raised about the Russian military's official death count -- by the media, by experts, by soldiers' families and by Russian soldiers themselves, who have taken to yelling out higher death tolls to reporters visiting sites of recent battles.</p> <p>At this sensitive phase in the latest Chechen war, when popular support is being tested by the letdown that comes from a delayed but still anticipated victory, new voices are joining the usual chorus of skeptics challenging the truth of Moscow's accounts of the war.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'finances']	<p>Acknowledging that the Kremlin had underestimated the cost of defeating Islamic rebels in Chechnya, a senior Russian official said today that Russia spent 50 percent more for the war in Chechnya last year than it initially planned.</p> <p>The soaring economic, military and human costs reflect the intensity of the fighting in the breakaway republic and the inability of the Russian forces to bring the conflict to an early close.</p>
['biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Some of the American money awarded to support Russia's civilian biological research was secretly shifted to Biopreparat, a shadowy organization that once directed the Soviet Union's germ warfare program, several Russian scientists say.</p> <p>American officials, who for five years have walked a delicate line in providing aid to Russia, remain suspicious about the activities of Biopreparat, which has been reborn as a state-owned drug company.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops scattered to look for rebel snipers as Nikolai P. Koshman climbed out of his helicopter to inspect this battered Chechen city.</p> <p>It was not long before he was bombarded with complaints. An agitated man said Russian artillery strikes had destroyed his home. An elderly woman whimpered that it was very hard for families to endure the war, and children had nothing to eat.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>In contrast to his predecessors as leader of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin appears to be a modern decision maker who knows how to make things happen, Clinton Administration officials say. What remains unclear is whether his political instincts match that style of action.</p> <p>''He can get the trains running on time, but the question is where the trains are going,'' said one senior policy maker. ''We may be looking at a modern decision maker but the question is whether he has progressive values.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>In a sharp departure from its previous assessment of Iran's nuclear capacity, the Central Intelligence Agency has told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a nuclear weapon, according to several United States officials.</p> <p>George Tenet, director of central intelligence, began briefings in December about the agency's new assessment, shortly after the document was completed, the officials said. The new evaluation has touched off a sharp debate about Iran's nuclear capacity, and the C.I.A.'s ability to monitor it.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Leaders of three Russian political parties agreed today to end their boycott of the Russian Parliament on Feb. 9, thereby avoiding an open-ended confrontation with the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his parliamentary allies.</p> <p>Mr. Putin had interceded in the parliamentary dispute earlier this week by meeting separately with two former prime ministers, Yevgeny M. Primakov and Sergei V. Kiriyenko. The men, together with Grigory A. Yavlinksy, leader of the liberal Yabloko party, led a parliamentary walkout last week to protest what they called strong-arm tactics by the Kremlin.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>A Russian doctor told the ambulance driver to take his patient directly to the morgue. ''Why?'' cried the patient. ''I'm not dead yet.'' ''Shut up,'' said the doctor. ''We're not there yet.''</p> <p>That lugubrious joke is being told about Vladimir Putin, chosen by the Kremlin clique to succeed Boris Yeltsin. In eight weeks, riding a wave of war hysteria, this K.G.B. apparatchik is likely to be elected president -- to take his patient, Russia, to the cooler of repression and autocratic rule.</p>
['public opinion', 'ethics']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin shocked his nation and the world today, announcing his resignation as president six months before the end of his term and handing over power to his favored successor, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>Mr. Yeltsin, 68, concluded his political career on the same note of surprise and high drama that accompanied his entire path from early convert to perestroika to erratic master of a free but floundering Russia.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>After the Kremlin's newborn political party registered a thumping victory in parliamentary elections last week, reporters asked Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin whether his strengthened hand might lead to changes in the government. Mr. Putin was characteristically forthcoming. ''We'll see,'' he said.</p> <p>That much Russia now sees, in spades. But in its new president's fashion, much about the man who now runs Russia, and who seems likely to win the suddenly scheduled election for the presidency in March, remains behind a veil.</p>
['biographical information', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish arms-control expert who found and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi weapons after the war in 1991 in the Persian Gulf, was called back today by Secretary General Kofi Annan to lead a new commission created to finish the job more than a year after monitoring broke down.</p> <p>Mr. Annan made the appointment after a deadline on Sunday came and went for the Security Council to come up with its own nomination. But in selecting Mr. Ekeus without achieving consensus in the council, the secretary general was in effect daring Iraq's supporters on the council, particularly Russia and China, to veto his choice.</p>
['elections']	<p>Underscoring the political imperative to bring the war in Chechnya to an early close, the Russian generals plan to conclude their military campaign by Feb. 26, exactly one month before Russia's presidential election.</p> <p>Lt. Gen. Gennadi Troshev, the deputy commander of Russian forces in the North Caucasus, announced the goal today in an interview with Russian reporters.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Clinton administration said today that it was ''unwise in the extreme'' to allow the government of Saddam Hussein to exercise veto power over United Nations decisions on how to resume arms inspections in Iraq.</p> <p>Criticizing Security Council members who are blocking Secretary General Kofi Annan's appointment of Rolf Ekeus as head of a new disarmament commission for Iraq, the State Department said that the United States stood by Mr. Annan and Mr. Ekeus, an arms control expert who is now Sweden's ambassador in Washington.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>By demonstrating a readiness to cut a deal with the Communists in the legislature, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's current and perhaps future president, is evidently willing to forsake ideological allies and embrace ideological enemies to achieve his ends. The question remains: what ends?</p> <p>Mr. Putin, who has clogged newspapers, airwaves and even the Internet with paeans to democratic ideals since taking power from Boris N. Yeltsin last month, stunned outsiders on Tuesday by making a power-sharing arrangement in the newly elected lower house of Parliament with the Communist Party, which would seem, ideologically, to be his sworn enemy. The Communists got a sheaf of committees and the all-powerful speaker's chair. In return, direct supporters of Mr. Putin, the acting president, got a lock on key legislative committees.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian troops kept their distance as a ragged band of Chechens strolled through the center of this desolate Chechen town.</p> <p>Most of the Chechens were decked out in dark blue coats. Some had no uniforms. But all were well armed, including one unshaven man who paraded across the main square with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher slung over each shoulder.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>In the days of Soviet power, the Red Army had political commissars in practically every unit to make sure the soldiers obediently followed the Communist Party line, including atheism.</p> <p>So Father Safrony's presence in the snow-capped mountains of the rebellious southern province of Chechnya still seems a bit unusual. Dressed in a camouflage uniform and black knit cap, the Russian Orthodox priest is the chaplain to the Russian paratroopers who are fighting the Chechen rebels near the Chechen-Dagestani border here.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Underscoring its darkening view of the West, the Kremlin issued a national security strategy today that inveighs against an expansionist Europe and United States and contemplates the use of nuclear weapons in war ''if all other means of resolving the crisis have been exhausted.''</p> <p>The revised language governing nuclear weapons is a subtle but unmistakable stiffening of the previous strategy, issued in 1997, which allowed the use of nuclear arms only ''in case of a threat to the existence of the Russian Federation.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'ethics']	<p>Only Vladimir V. Putin knows for certain where he wants to take Russia as the nation's acting president. But if his visit last week to the federal Railways Ministry is any indication, Russia may be in for an interesting trip indeed.</p> <p>As the Moscow daily Kommersant reported, Mr. Putin performed the rote ceremonial duties at a packed meeting of ministry employees eight days ago, doling out awards and praising the railroads' contribution to the economy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>On his first full day as Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin left before dawn today to visit with Russian troops fighting in Chechnya.</p> <p>While his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, spent his first day of retirement at a government country house outside Moscow, Mr. Putin and his wife, Lyudmila -- he in a turtleneck sweater, she in pants and a sheepskin coat -- spent what was left of the momentous New Year's holiday greeting Russian soldiers and handing out hunting knives as presidential souvenirs.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>When he is asked about the fighting in Grozny, Konstantin Kukhlovets shows the red splotch on his index finger. The 24-year-old lieutenant said he was firing his machine gun so furiously that he was scalded by the heat of the gun barrel.</p> <p>Three of his men were wounded in a 10-minute firefight, and Lieutenant Kukhlovets says his entire unit might have been annihilated if they had tried to fight their way into the center of the city against entrenched Chechen rebels.</p>
['elections']	<p>Boris Yeltsin's unexpected resignation was a brilliant political ploy, and one with worrisome implications for the West.</p> <p>The move was clever because it enhanced the presidential prospects of Mr. Yeltsin's chosen successor, Vladimir Putin; it will improve the chances of Mr. Yeltsin's being remembered as a patriot rather than a leader who put ambition ahead of the nation's interests; and it allowed Mr. Putin to give Mr. Yeltsin immunity against corruption charges.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Confronted with fierce rebel resistance, rising casualties and bad weather,  the Russian military announced today that it was suspending its assault on the Chechen capital, Grozny.</p> <p>Lt. Gen. Gennadi N. Troshev, deputy commander of the Russian troops fighting in the separatist region of Chechnya, said the pause was intended to allow the thousands of civilians still trapped in Grozny to escape from the fighting. He did not say how long it would last.</p>
['foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>On a bitterly cold afternoon last fall, a handful of Russian scientists gathered at a deserted cemetery in Siberia for an impromptu ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of what was once the Soviet Union's largest laboratory for developing viral weapons.</p> <p>Lev S. Sandakhchiev, the director of the lab, known as Vector, situated in the town of Koltsovo, raised a plastic cup of vodka to the memory of Nikolai Ustinov, a scientist who died in the spring of 1988 after accidentally infecting himself with the Marburg virus, a hemorrhagic killer that he and his colleagues were trying to perfect as a weapon.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian forces battled today to restore control behind their front lines after surprise attacks on Sunday by Chechen rebels. The Russian Defense Minister also announced that he was lifting the suspension of air and artillery attacks on Grozny, the Chechen  capital, and resuming a full-scale offensive.</p> <p>''There cannot be any talk about a cease-fire,'' Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said. Russia also imposed an evening curfew on the entire rebellious republic and announced that  every male under the age of 65 traveling around Chechnya would be stopped and questioned.</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>Russia's Acting President, Vladimir V. Putin, today selected an experienced debt negotiator as his top deputy prime minister and shunted aside two high- ranking government officials closely linked with former President Boris N. Yeltsin, further putting his own stamp on the Kremlin.</p> <p>By choosing Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, 42, for the Russian government's No. 2 position, Mr. Putin also signaled the importance of Russia's relations with its Western creditors -- and dropped a hint about a possible successor as prime minister, if he wins the March 26 presidential elections. Until the elections, Mr. Putin will stay on as Russia's prime minister.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>A senior aide to former President Boris N. Yeltsin, apparently charged in a Swiss money-laundering case, said today that the accusations were slanderous and that he would face questioning in Switzerland if asked.</p> <p>At the same time, Russian prosecutors cast doubt on the nature of the charges, saying a Swiss warrant for the aide, Pavel P. Borodin, seemed to call only for his testimony and not, as the Swiss have said, for his arrest.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Russian authorities confirmed today that they had detained a journalist who was reporting from Chechnya for Radio Liberty.</p> <p>An Interior Ministry spokesman said the journalist, Andrei M. Babitsky, who had been missing for 12 days, was being held in a jail in Chechnya because he had spent time with the rebels and was not accredited by the Russian military to cover the war.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The commander of Russia's Interior Ministry troops, which have the main responsibility for clearing Grozny of rebel fighters, was replaced today as Russian forces continued to encounter stiff resistance in the Chechen capital.</p> <p>The Russian advance has gone slowly as the troops have been engaged in costly house-to-house fighting. The military said today that it controlled about one-third of Grozny.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton administration's top policy maker on Russia, in his annual assessment of where that country is headed, has presented a more wary review this time, even hinting at the possible return of some Soviet habits.</p> <p>The policy official, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, said in a speech at Oxford University in England on Friday that the war in Chechnya and the transfer of power to Acting President Vladimir V. Putin raised the question of how the resurgence of Russian nationalism would assert itself.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>Today's flag-raising ceremony in northwest Grozny was supposed to be a made-for-television event that would illustrate the progress Russian forces have made in taking back the tattered ruins that are the Chechen capital.</p> <p>But when a group of reporters and photographers arrived at the outskirts of the city, they were abruptly turned away. Even the Russian-occupied areas of Grozny were filled with rebel snipers, a military press officer explained.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>By any reasonable judgment, life is unspeakable for the 6,000 or so denizens of the Solglacia refugee camp, a network of 250 tents and a strand of rail cars set along the sinuous main road to Grozny.</p> <p>There is one water spigot. Electricity was spotty until January. Hot meals ceased three weeks ago.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'elections', 'atomic energy']	<p>The citizens of this closed military city, which hides one of Russia's nuclear submarine bases above the Arctic Circle, are staging an extraordinary civic revolt. In a referendum on whether the fleet can put a nuclear waste dump just outside the city limits, they are taking on the navy they have long served.</p> <p>On March 26, Election Day, the people here -- their number an official secret -- will engage in a battle that they feel far more intensely about than the lopsided presidential contest that Acting President Vladimir V. Putin is expected to win.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a surprise appearance at a Middle East conference here, the acting president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, sat down two chairs away from the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and delivered his first foreign policy statement, which within 15 minutes delineated the differences between the two countries.</p> <p>Yet in his brisk, businesslike summary of fairly standard points, Mr. Putin did not mention the war in Chechnya. Russia considers the war an internal affair, but Washington continues to press Moscow to negotiate a settlement to end it.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>Less than a month after ceding power, Boris N. Yeltsin is preparing to publish his memoirs of two tumultuous terms as president of the Russian republic with a new American publisher that has offered the enticement of speed rather than an outsize advance.</p> <p>With a handshake at his villa outside Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin, 69, agreed last month to publish his memoirs, tentatively titled ''Midnight Diaries, with the co-writer from his previous two books, Valentin Yumashev, a former Russian magazine journalist who was a chief of staff in Mr. Yeltsin's administration. The book is scheduled to appear in stores in October.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'bombs and explosives', 'war and revolution', 'biographical information']	<p>Timur Dakhkilgov is a soft-spoken man who toils for long hours in a gritty dye factory to support his pregnant wife and two small children. He is also a victim of the Kremlin's war against terrorism.</p> <p>After a series of mysterious bombings rocked the Russian capital in September, Mr. Dakhkilgov was publicly identified as the leading suspect in the case and cast into prison, where he says he was tortured and warned that his family would be turned over to a vengeful mob if did not confess.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov today took himself out of the running in the March 26 presidential election, deserting a field that is already dominated by Acting President Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>Mr. Primakov, 70, leader of the  foundering centrist opposition, said  today that his decision was based on his conclusion that Russia still had a long way to go before becoming a civil society and a true democracy.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Oman has agreed to accept the Russian tanker seized by two American warships that were enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq, a Pentagon official said today.</p> <p>Oman is letting the Maritime Inspection Force escort the Russian-flagged tanker, which is suspected of smuggling oil out of Iraq, to one of its ports, where officials will await the results of a laboratory analysis of an oil sample to determine its origin, the official said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In June 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin came to Washington to celebrate ''partnership and friendship'' with the United States. ''We have left behind the period when America and Russia looked at each other through gun sights,'' he told a joint session of Congress.</p> <p>Nothing better symbolizes the subsequent decline of Russian-American relations than the recent announcement that Russian military strategists had approved use of nuclear weapons ''to repel armed aggression'' -- which some see as a threatening expansion of Russian nuclear doctrines.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'children and youth']	<p>In one of the hundreds of tents thrown up on a wind-whipped, treeless plain to house Chechen war refugees, a handful of youngsters perched in a semicircle on wooden stools this afternoon and revealed to a curious visitor their fondest hopes.</p> <p>Zura, blond and girlish at 10, was decisive. ''I want no war,'' she said firmly.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright came here today to try to convince Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, whom she has often called her good friend, about the wisdom of a new American missile defense system.</p> <p>At the end of a lengthy session of talks, she conceded she had made little headway.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Soon after he became prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin summoned his predecessors to a September meeting to discuss Chechnya.</p> <p>A limited operation to seal the borders of the breakaway republic and to occupy the pro-Russian parts had been planned for months. But Russian generals, humiliated by the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, were pushing for a decisive fight.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>A  CENTURY ago the equation of great music with spiritual uplift was a prevailing article of faith. To John Sullivan Dwight, the Boston critic who fathered American classical music, Beethoven's symphonies seemed ''sacred.'' To Theodore Thomas, the itinerant conductor who fathered the American orchestra, symphonic concerts were ''sermons in tones.'' Music making and music listening were cherished as inherently wholesome activities. Concerts were morally empowering.</p> <p>The first half of the 20th century ridiculed and discarded this religion of music. World War I botched civilization -- the plunge of which ''in this abyss of blood and darkness,'' wrote Henry James, ''is a thing that . . . gives away the whole long age during which we have supposed the world to be, with whatever abatement, gradually bettering.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Radio Liberty journalist Andrei Babitsky, re-arrested Friday after surfacing from more than a month's detention in Chechnya, has told his colleagues at the American radio network that Russian officials violated the agreement under which he voluntarily agreed to be exchanged for Russian soldiers.</p> <p>As a result, he was coerced into the roadside swap Feb. 2 under protest, a colleague said today. Mr. Babitsky, a Russian national whose radio reports on civilian suffering and military brutality in the war in Chechnya inflamed the Russian authorities, has been detained since Jan. 16 in a case that has drawn international attention over the manner in which Russian security services seized a war correspondent and traded him into captivity.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'bombs and explosives', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian commanders today ordered the devastated city of Grozny emptied of its surviving residents and sealed.</p> <p>Col. Nikolai A. Zaitsev, a senior Interior Ministry officer, said the capital of the embattled province of Chechnya had become too dangerous for its inhabitants. He said Grozny would be off limits for two weeks while Interior Ministry troops combed it for weapons, unexploded bombs and booby traps.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>The American employer of a Russian reporter missing after covering the conflict in Chechnya accused the Clinton administration today of not pressing Moscow hard enough on his behalf.</p> <p>''I hope more will be done -- and more can be done,'' said Thomas A. Dine, the president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which relies on financing from the United States government.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Two American warships enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq seized a Russian tanker in the Persian Gulf today after boarding it and discovering evidence that it might be smuggling oil out of southern Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said.</p> <p>A lightly armed boarding party from the guided missile cruiser Monterey landed on the tanker by helicopter on Wednesday after repeated attempts to get the tanker to respond to radio queries about its cargo, said the spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>In an episode that underscores the limits imposed on reporting from Chechnya, Russia handed over a Radio Liberty correspondent to Chechen rebels today in exchange for two Russian soldiers.</p> <p>Russian authorities had detained the correspondent, Andrei M. Babitsky, a Russian, on Jan. 16 as he was leaving the rebel controlled section of Grozny.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>''No filming the corpses,'' a military press officer barked as a group of correspondents jumped off a Russian Army helicopter on the outskirts of the Chechen capital.</p> <p>Six dead Russian soldiers were wrapped in shiny metal foil and lined up in a muddy field. Some photographer quietly sneaked a shot, but the grisly images were not included in the Russian television news.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>Friends and colleagues of a Russian reporter for the American-funded Radio Liberty have been making increasingly frantic appeals for information about him five days after Russia announced that it had handed him over to Chechen rebels.</p> <p>They say they are increasingly dissatisfied with the government's handling of the case and doubtful about whether they are being told the truth.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>After a month of what she called ''psychobabble'' from people trying to decipher Russia's new leader, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met Vladimir V. Putin today on his turf and said she was taken with his ''can-do approach'' and his lack of dogma.</p> <p>''I found him a very well-informed person, a good interlocutor, obviously a Russian patriot who seeks a normal position with the West,'' she said of Mr. Putin, who also caught her attention by abandoning note cards that his aides had prepared for him.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>A Russian reporter for Radio Liberty who has been missing since last week is being held by rebel commanders in Chechnya, a representative of the government there told a Moscow radio station today.</p> <p>The reporter, Andrei Babitsky, has been missing since Thursday, when, according to the Russians, they traded him for soldiers held by the Chechens.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Refugees trickling out of Chechnya into the makeshift camps that pock the Caucasus foothills near Nazran are bringing stories of what could be one of the worst civilian massacres in the Chechen war.</p> <p>They charge that ''kontraktniki'' -- Russian men hired by the army to fight in Chechnya -- staged a drunken rampage of looting and gunfire through the tiny, bombed-out, straw-brick homes of a neighborhood called Aldi in the Chechen capital, Grozny.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia and the United States are in a drawn-out dispute over a powerful American-made radar in Norway that can track missile launchings in western Russia, according to American and Russian officials.</p> <p>The radar began operating last summer as a joint United States-Norwegian intelligence project at Vardo, 40 miles from the Russian border. It has been the subject of talks between Washington and Moscow ever since its assembly began a year and a half ago, officials said.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Using the toughest terms since the pro-democracy movement was crushed in Beijing more than a decade ago, the United States sharply criticized China today for what it called a marked deterioration in human rights.</p> <p>The annual report on human rights released by the State Department dealt separately with more than 180 countries. But much of the focus was on China, where the Clinton administration's relations have grown even more tense this week, and on Russia, where the administration is intent on developing a relationship with the new leadership despite the Russian crackdown in Chechnya.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a major agreement aimed at safeguarding nuclear fuel that could be used to make weapons, Russia has promised to stop making plutonium out of fuel from its civilian power reactors as part of a $100 million joint research and aid package from the United States, Clinton administration and Russian officials say.</p> <p>While the administration has several collaborative programs that enhance the safety and security of plutonium produced by Russia's military, this is the Energy Department's first major attempt to secure Russia's huge civilian stockpile of plutonium, from which 3,000 nuclear weapons could be made.</p>
['religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>Jorg Haider, the rightist leader whose Freedom Party is part of the new Austrian government, said today that ethnic Germans expelled from what was Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II should be entitled to the same compensation as Austrian Jews persecuted by the Nazis.</p> <p>The statement reopened an old, often suppressed grievance in the German-speaking world. It centers on the expulsion from their homes or the imprisonment in the Soviet Union of millions of Germans in the aftermath of Hitler's war and the lack of compensation for their losses or suffering.</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>With the inevitability of a Greek tragedy, Russia's military intervention in Chechnya has followed the script rehearsed in the war in the mid-1990's.</p> <p>As in February 1995, Russian soldiers are picking over the ruins of Grozny, the Chechen capital, after a costly fight and are facing a vicious battle in the mountains of southern Chechnya. Russia must now decide if it wants to repeat the closing act of the previous war, when it rejected negotiations with the Chechens after taking Grozny. It only conceded to a peace agreement in 1997, after two years of guerrilla warfare and terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>A senior Russian security official who met with President Clinton today appeared to open the door slightly to meeting the administration's desire to deploy a limited national missile defense system.</p> <p>But at the same time, the official, Sergei B. Ivanov, the head of Russia's national security council, said Moscow wanted to keep the essence of the antiballistic missile treaty that the administration is seeking to change.</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>Russia has reached an agreement with foreign commercial creditors to restructure $31.8 billion of its external debt, handing Acting President Vladimir V. Putin an important political victory and helping to clear the way for the country to tap international money markets again.</p> <p>Russia was effectively barred from borrowing overseas after the August 1998 economic crisis, when it defaulted on domestic treasury bills and stopped making payments on its debts to foreign banks and governments. Over the last 18 months, Russia has met with representatives of the London Club of commercial creditors, a loose affiliation of banks and investors, to draw up a repayment schedule to ease Russia's debt burden and to restore its image.</p>

By his way of thinking, it was Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his squishy notions of perestroika and glasnost -- restructuring and openness -- that brought Russia to ruination in the first place.</p> <p>''When he took off the handcuffs, he should have done so slowly,'' Mr. Khasanov said as he sat, nursing a vodka hangover with ulcer medicine, on a train bound to a Mongolia construction job. ''Because now people don't know what to do with their freedom.''</p>
['elections']	<p>The movie theater was plastered with posters for coming films from Hollywood, but inside there was no attraction for Yuliya Lysova and Dasha Yegorova, both 18. A decade after the Soviet collapse, they were being forced, on a school day, to attend a ''Young People for Zyuganov'' rally featuring the Communist Party's candidate for president, Gennadi A. Zyuganov.</p> <p>''Our teacher told us to come here instead of classes,'' said Ms. Lysova, glancing at her watch, then at the door of the auditorium, trying to determine whether the coast was clear for a fast exit. ''It was obligatory.''</p>
['biographical information']	<p>'You know,'' says Igor Shadkhan, as we sit in his office and discuss his longtime friend Vladimir Putin, ''Henry Kissinger came here to St. Petersburg when Putin was deputy mayor. Putin spoke to him in German.''</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, has a few unlikely friends, and one of them is Igor Shadkhan -- a Jewish documentary film producer who says he was a quiet anti-Soviet dissident in his day. Any self-respecting K.G.B. officer should have had three different kinds of alarm bells ringing over these attributes, but not, it seems, the future president. Shadkhan made a film about Putin in the early 90's, when the latter was first deputy mayor of Petersburg and became his friend.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>With Russia's presidential elections just a week away, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin sought to reassure voters today that the war in Chechnya was drawing to a close and that some Russian troops would soon be on their way home.</p> <p>''There will be no more organized resistance,'' Mr. Putin said. ''Large-scale military operations are coming to an end.''</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'ethics']	<p>When Boris N. Yeltsin was re-elected Russia's president in 1996, he owed his victory in large part to the so-called oligarchs, a group of Russian multimillionaires -- bankers, oilmen and media moguls -- who in turn owed their wealth and influence to Mr. Yeltsin.</p> <p>This closed and cozy circle worked very well for a very few in Russia until Dec. 31 when Mr. Yeltsin suddenly resigned, putting the Kremlin in the hands of Vladimir V. Putin, the man poised to win Russia's presidential election on March 26.</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Opening its annual meeting today, the United Nations human rights organization faces a crowded docket of supposed violations by a number of countries, including China and Russia.</p> <p>The United States plans to introduce a resolution that would criticize China for what Washington says are deteriorating human rights, including a crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement. Members of that group protested silently outside the United Nations headquarters here today.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>As Russia's election campaign moved into the home stretch, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin recently hopped a commuter train out of Moscow to meet with factory workers on the city's outskirts.</p> <p>He was not the only politician who made the trip. Yuri M. Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor and formerly one of Mr. Putin's bitterest rivals, also showed up to demonstrate his loyalty.</p>
['elections']	<p>With only four days before primaries that could seal his fate as a presidential candidate, former Senator Bill Bradley today defied conventional political wisdom and spoke about an issue of little concern to voters this year: foreign policy.</p> <p>Mr. Bradley offered his most detailed remarks to date on the United States' foreign policy, criticizing the Clinton-Gore administration's handling of Russia and China and promising to pursue a broadly internationalist policy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a daring assault deep inside territory that the Russians thought they controlled, Chechen rebels ambushed a Russian convoy near Grozny on Thursday, killing 20 police officers and wounding 29.</p> <p>According to reports reaching here today, the rebels blasted the first and last truck of the nine-truck convoy and engaged the stranded soldiers in a four-hour firefight before melting into the mist.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>The air is so choked with dust deep in the October Revolution Mine that only the beams from the coal miners' headlamps are visible in the distance.</p> <p>That group of 12 miners is wrestling with a roaring grinding machine that works its way like an iron mole along the seam. It gouges chunks of sparkling coal from the wall and spews the shards onto a conveyor.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's state-owned television has broadcast reports that the nation's leading liberal challenger to Vladimir V. Putin is supported by Jews, homosexuals and foreigners.</p> <p>The three prime-time reports by the ORT television network were clearly intended to exploit the anti-Semitism, homophobia and suspicion of foreigners that still pervade Russian society, as well as its enthusiasm for conspiracy theories.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'elections']	<p>On the day after his decisive victory in a field of 11 candidates in the presidential election on Sunday, Vladimir V. Putin told his cabinet today that it was time to put ''all our work'' on a new economic program into one ''weighty document'' by the time he is sworn in and appoints his new government in early May.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's reference to an economic blueprint that he steadfastly refused to discuss during the campaign was a pointed reminder that planning was well under way for his presidency.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>President Clinton congratulated President-elect Vladimir V. Putin today on his victory in the Russian election, but also reiterated in a brief telephone conversation White House concerns about Russia's continuing conflict in Chechnya.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton placed the call this morning after it became clear that Mr. Putin had received enough votes in the balloting on Sunday to avoid a runoff next month against Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, who finished a distant second. Mr. Clinton's remarks reflected the administration's optimism toward Mr. Putin but also its wait-and-see attitude toward the former intelligence officer who has spoken of being a reformer and of integrating Russia into the world community.</p>
['elections']	<p>As Russia ambles toward a second presidential election almost surreal in its absence of sturm, drang or even garden-variety suspense, perhaps its most amazing aspect is that nobody yet has a clear notion of what the front-runner in the race -- if it can be called a race -- would actually do if elected.</p> <p>That front-runner, of course, is Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's acting president and the anointed successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin. With but five days to the vote, Mr. Putin's name recognition is no problem: his spare visage is plastered on every newspaper and television screen and extolled by local kingpins in regions many time zones away.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>The last time this city's white-walled fortress fell to Moscow was in 1552, when Ivan the Terrible defeated the powerful Tatar khanate of Kazan. Now Tatarstan -- one of the 89 regions in Russia's awkward and disjointed federation -- is under siege again, this time by Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>Mr. Putin, the acting president and the clear favorite in the March 26 presidential election, keeps hammering away at variations of a single theme: the urgent need to restore the authority of a strong central government in Russia and bring its far-flung, free-wheeling regions to heel.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media']	<p>The heavy steel doors, freshly painted for visitors, swung open one by one along a 100-foot-long corridor to reveal cold cells, gauzy from cigarette smoke and poor ventilation, where the sallow faces of Chechen men and women peered out from the shadows -- their eyes frozen by the flash of intruding cameras.</p> <p>Their guards barked orders at them to ''stand back from the door!'' or to ''turn around!'' or ''speak up!'' and to report to a group of visitors on the conditions in this notorious ''filtration'' camp. Some who have passed through here have alleged that brutal beatings and torture have taken place.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>More than a month after he disappeared, Andrei Babitsky, a Radio Liberty reporter, returned to Moscow today, and said he had been held in a Russian camp for detainees outside Chechnya, where he said he and others were routinely beaten.</p> <p>The case of Mr. Babitsky has spurred concerns about press freedom in Russia. Before his arrest, Russian authorities were angry about Mr. Babitsky's reporting from Chechnya. Russian troops detained him as he left Grozny, the Chechen capital, on Jan. 16.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>Many people remember reading George Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' in high school or college, with its chilling finale in which the farm animals looked back and forth at the tyrannical pigs and the exploitative human farmers but found it ''impossible to say which was which.''</p> <p>That ending was altered in the 1955 animated version, which removed the humans, leaving only the nasty pigs. Another example of Hollywood butchering great literature? Yes, but in this case the film's secret producer was the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>At his first meeting with a Western leader since he became the Russian head of state, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin today told Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that he was willing to give human rights organizations more access to the war zone in Chechnya.</p> <p>But with Russian troops fighting some of the bloodiest battles of the five-month war, Mr. Putin, the certain favorite in Russia's March 26 presidential elections, gave no ground as Mr. Blair pressed for peace talks with Chechen rebels.</p>
['elections', 'ethics']	<p>The first great test of a new democracy is not only in the way its government tolerates opposition, but whether it is willing to transfer power to that opposition after a fair election.</p> <p>The new United States faced that test in 1801, after the ruling party of John Adams and Alexander Hamilton had been beaten in the popular vote by Thomas Jefferson's Anti-Federalists. It was touch and go for weeks, as the stunned Federalists tried to make a deal with Aaron Burr to block Jefferson's presidency. Only secret patronage concessions, hotly denied, and Hamilton's personal hatred of Burr caused the party in power to turn over the keys to the Executive Mansion.</p>
['books and literature', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>PublicAffairs, a New York company that is fast becoming the publishing house for Kremlin politicians, is preparing to rush into print in May with an English translation of the memoirs describing the life, travails and cold war spying adventures of Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>The original Russian version of ''First Person,'' is still unavailable in Russia, where the country's Central Electoral Commission has temporarily barred publication until after the March 26 presidential election.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>When Acting President Vladimir V. Putin met behind closed doors last month with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, he made an unusual appeal that Russia be considered a member of the Western club.</p> <p>Mr. Putin said he liked to eat Chinese food, knew how to use chopsticks and regularly practiced judo.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>As a sudden blizzard added unexpected drama to Russia's presidential elections, voters strolling through the grounds of the Trinity Monastery of St. Sergius summed up the reasons why Vladimir V. Putin will be elected Russia's next leader, if not today, then in a second round on April 16.</p> <p>Many said they liked him for his decisiveness. Others applauded his discipline, his energy or his relative youth.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Acting President Vladimir V. Putin  won a narrow majority of the vote today in Russia's presidential election, gaining the outright victory that the Kremlin had pursued with growing desperation to avoid a runoff next month.</p> <p>Although Mr. Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute terms -- some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov -- it appeared likely to fall considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days, about the depth of Mr. Putin's popular support.</p>
['television', 'elections']	<p>With a hefty lead in the polls, Vladimir V. Putin has perfected his campaign strategy -- act presidential, shun televised debates and mock some of the other rituals of electoral politics.</p> <p>The tactics of the acting, and almost certainly future, president were on display today on a visit to Ivanovo, a down-at-the-heels textile factory town 180 miles northeast of here.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>With less than one month to go before Russians vote in an election that is almost certain to be won by Acting President Vladimir V. Putin, some of the liberals who hailed his rise are voicing fears that there may be authoritarian instincts lurking beneath Mr Putin's well-turned democratic phrases.</p> <p>With a war raging in Chechnya on Russia's southern border, tight restrictions imposed on information and a propaganda campaign glorifying the military and security services, members of Russia's small liberal elite say that Mr. Putin's pledges to observe human rights and to respect legal and democratic norms are still promises waiting to be fulfilled.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>An investigator for Human Rights Watch told Congress today that his group had documented three ''large-scale massacres'' by Russian forces in Chechnya. That prompted Democratic and Republican senators to criticize the Clinton administration, saying that it was playing down Russia's conduct in the war to keep its relationship with Moscow intact for other issues like arms control.</p> <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, the ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration had ''tiptoed'' around human rights abuses in the war because it was ''so worried about affecting other aspects of the relationship.''</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals']	<p>A Russian officer was charged today with killing a civilian in Chechnya, a rare move by the Russian military to crack down on human rights abuses.</p> <p>The chief of the Russian General Staff, Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, informed Acting President Vladimir V. Putin of the arrest.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>With President-elect Vladimir V. Putin moving to put his government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and tycoons should be included in his inner circle.</p> <p>But Mr. Putin has made it clear that he will be in no hurry to decide everything. And in his first major personnel decision today, he caught the capital's attention with a change that he did not make: He decided not to replace Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, the defense minister.</p>
['elections']	<p>Marina Shurina, a 25-year-old underemployed lawyer, sat in a small, spare room with white walls and empty shelves, waiting for voters to call about the campaign of Ella Pamfilova, one of the 11 people, and the only woman, running in Russia's presidential election on Sunday.</p> <p>Ms. Shurina's phone was not exactly ringing off the hook. And with no signs, posters or bumper stickers anywhere in sight -- not on the street, not on the grubby stairwell, not on the door, not even inside Ms. Shurina's second-floor office -- the chances of voters just dropping by, looking for information, offering to lend a hand, were virtually nil.</p>
['elections', 'ethics']	<p>If he is elected president on Sunday, as everyone expects he will be, Vladimir V. Putin says he will use a trusted group of former colleagues from the K.G.B. to tackle Russia's endemic corruption.</p> <p>''I am bringing into my inner-circle people from law enforcement bodies who are in no way connected with the people and structures which may be associated with any form of corruption,'' the acting president said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>As President-elect Vladimir V. Putin flew north beyond the Arctic Circle this week to ride a nuclear-powered submarine and burnish his image as commander in chief, the event that was making political waves was the scuttling of his hand-picked candidate for governor of his home region here.</p> <p>In a humbling concession to the political strength and popularity of the incumbent governor, Vladimir Yakovlev, Mr. Putin recalled Valentina Matviyenko, his first deputy prime minister, from her vacation on Tuesday and, according to Ms. Matviyenko, asked her to pull out of the race she had entered with the Kremlin's blessing less than a month ago.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A Russian tanker chartered by one of the world's largest oil companies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, was carrying Iraqi oil on April 5 in violation of the international embargo against Iraq when it was stopped by American sailors, American and company officials said today.</p> <p>The United Nations has fined the company $2 million, after determining that some of the the 78,000 metric tons of oil aboard the tanker came from Iraq. The tanker, the Akademik Pustovoit, was boarded by American-led naval forces in the Persian Gulf three weeks ago.</p>
['religion and churches', 'espionage']	<p>The pending trial in Iran of 13 Jews on espionage charges is being monitored outside the country as a gauge of the evolving balance of power between the forces of tolerance and the Islamic revolution's more zealous adherents.</p> <p>Since the charges were brought in March 1999 against the Jewish men, as well as eight unidentified Muslims, the case has generated questions from a broad range of governments and organizations. Top officials in Western Europe, Japan, the United Nations, the Arab world and particularly Russia have openly expressed qualms about what the outcome of the trial might be.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>Russia hardened its line today against any American attempts to modify a 1972 missile defense treaty and appealed for broad support from other nations, saying the United States was putting three decades of arms agreements in jeopardy.</p> <p>Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov spoke here to representatives of more than 150 nations on the second day of four-week international conference called to assess another treaty, the 1968 pact barring the spread of nuclear weapons. He said Russia is prepared to make deep cuts in its nuclear warheads, but not if the United States plans to construct a missile defense system that would ''destroy'' the 1972 pact, the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution']	<p>The nation's capital is bracing for the springtime Invasion of the Demonstrators. The corner outside my office is patrolled by helmeted cops ordered to smile at marchers while snarling traffic; barricades channel the flow of picketing, chanting paraders; windows are being boarded up by nervous restaurateurs.</p> <p>I love it. No dissident Chinese is allowed to protest in Tiananmen Square, and no apathetic Russian can be moved to hold up a sign in Red Square, but the streets around the White House are filled with Americans espousing their causes.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he disagreed with Russia's new national security doctrine that calls for first use of nuclear weapons in the event of a large- scale attack on Russia by conventional forces, or those employing weapons of mass destruction.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>A decade after the collapse of Communism appeared to make superpower arms controls routine, the old disputes over missile defenses have suddenly returned to the forefront of United States-Russian relations. And though experts say new rules of the nuclear game are technically feasible, the issue has been caught up in American election politics and Russian suspicions.</p> <p>At issue are the fundamental principles that Washington and Moscow have accepted for almost three decades, that the only way to encourage reductions in strategic arms is to restrict ways to counter them -- an understanding codified in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tried today to convince the world that the United States is not threatening to undercut a quarter century of progress on arms control by developing a new antimissile defense system that has drawn criticism from both Russia and China.</p> <p>''If the Clinton administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM treaty and strategic arms control,'' she told an international arms-control conference, ''we have surely gone about it in a strange way -- in the open, with care and in consultation not only with Congress, but after extensive discussions with our allies and other countries, Russia and China emphatically included.''</p>
['books and literature', 'computers and the internet']	<p>First came horror, then instant history: Russia's new president Vladimir Putin is taking an electronic page from Stephen King and is preparing to issue his translated memoirs in a digital book that will be available at the end of April.</p> <p>The New Age Russian president and former K.G.B. spy is also considering another technical innovation to drop the veil on the facts of his own life: chat room discussions with Internet users on the MSNBC Web site.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The phrase most often used by friend and foe alike to describe British Prime Minister Tony Blair is ''control freak.''</p> <p>He tightly controls the flow of all government information from 10 Downing Street, and put in a financial supporter to chair the BBC. He ''devolved'' power to Scotland and Wales so as to make most of that leadership loyal to him. He abolished hereditary peers so that power in Britain's conservative House of Lords would shift to his Labor appointees.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>Senior Republican senators told President Clinton this week that they opposed his efforts to renegotiate an arms control treaty with Russia and to build only a limited antimissile defense system.</p> <p>The senators -- including the majority leader, Trent Lott, and Jesse Helms -- favor a full, robust defense system against missiles, and many of them prefer to scrap the treaty altogether. They worry that Mr. Clinton will be too willing to compromise in order to conclude a strategic arms agreement with Russia before he leaves office.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'law and legislation', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>In an unusual display of political unity, the Russian Parliament today handed President-elect Vladimir V. Putin his third overwhelming vote in a week ratifying a major arms control accord. The vote set the stage for a diplomatic campaign to put the United States on the defensive in nuclear disarmament talks.</p> <p>By a vote of 298 to 74, the lower house of Parliament ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that the United States Senate rejected last October. In the last seven days, Mr. Putin won ratification in both the upper and lower houses of a strategic arms reduction accord that calls for halving the American and Russian arsenals to no more than 3,500 warheads each.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>In his first official trip since being elected president, Vladimir V. Putin visited one of Russia's leading nuclear weapons design centers and vowed to preserve the nation's nuclear might.</p> <p>''We must increase the efficiency of our nuclear potential,'' Mr. Putin said at a meeting at the Chelyabinsk-70 complex near here, where thousands of nuclear scientists live and work behind a barricade of barbed wire.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'russia-international relations-us', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today that she had dropped her objections to $500 million in loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank to a Russian oil company that had been accused of fraud.</p> <p>The company, Tyumen, wants to spend $292 million to hire a Houston company, Haliburton, to rehabilitate an oil field in western Siberia, and $198 million for ABB Lummus Global, of Bloomfield, N.J., to modernize a refinery near Moscow.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In his first visit to the West since winning office, Russia's president-elect, Vladimir V. Putin, today courted foreign businessmen, met with the queen and offered some unsolicited advice on the stock market.</p> <p>Eager to burnish his economic credentials and overcome Western suspicion about his K.G.B. past, he dismissed Friday's rout on Wall Street as little more than a blip.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>The Russian political analyst Sergei Markov was trying to explain to me over tea the other day the state of the Russian state: ''If you look at it from far away,'' he said, ''the Russian state looks like a big [Charles] Atlas, full of muscles. But as you get closer you realize that this Atlas is actually dead. Inside, this huge body is full of worms, who are eating the body and feeding off it. Sometimes an arm or a leg moves a little, but that's not because Atlas is alive, it's because the worms have moved an arm or leg. It's a very depressing and ugly state.''</p> <p>I'll say. Mr. Markov's imagery may be overdrawn, but it's not all that far from the truth. The most important story in Russia today is what has happened to the Russian state. It has been privatized, and, like everything else, in the worst possible way.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Last week, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin pushed the long-awaited ratification of a major arms control treaty through a compliant lower house of Parliament. Today, he scored a victory with regional bosses in Parliament's upper chamber, easily winning a vote to get rid of a prosecutor who was the scourge of former President Boris N. Yeltsin's Kremlin.</p> <p>For good measure, the upper house also approved the nuclear arms reduction agreement known as Start II, which passed the lower house last Friday.</p> <p>The most vivid display of loyalty from the governors and local leaders in the Federation Council, as the upper house is called, was their 133-to-10 vote to dismiss Yuri I. Skuratov, the general prosecutor whom Mr. Yeltsin tried twice to fire last year after he began to investigate corruption in the Kremlin itself.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'children and youth', 'elections']	<p>When Russian bombs rained down on Grozny last fall, the city's only orphanage moved to this small town in northern Chechnya.</p> <p>It was supposed to have been a temporary stay.

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>In six weeks, the cock-of-the-walk president of Russia and the lame-duck president of the U.S. will hold what Churchill called ''a parley at the summit'' in Moscow.</p> <p>The central subject: Russia's need to cut the cost of maintaining thousands of missiles aimed at the U.S., and America's need for limited defense against rogue-nation missiles.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>For 50 years the old master drawings lay tucked away under a bed in a provincial Russian city, the guilty secret of an anonymous Soviet Army officer who scooped them up from the basement of a German castle at the end of World War II as the army made its way home from Berlin.</p> <p>And the 18th-century mosaic of semiprecious stones is one of four that graced the walls of the toffee-colored Amber Room in a palace outside St. Petersburg until 1941, when the entire room was dismantled and carted away by the occupying German Army.</p>
['finances', 'elections']	<p>For once, George W. Bush was not acting like the Washington outsider.</p> <p>In one of his rare visits to the nation's capital, and his first since clinching the Republican presidential nomination, the Texas governor huddled privately today with a Republican senator and a Democratic one on Social Security. He also burnished his foreign policy credentials by meeting with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign investments', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'elections', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Gov. George W. Bush met with the Russian foreign minister today, airing differences over a missile defense system and Chechnya but still expressing hope that the two nuclear powers ''can work together to keep peace in the world.''</p> <p>For Mr. Bush, who has faced sustained questions about his inexperience in foreign affairs, the hourlong session with the Russian, Igor S. Ivanov, was his second venture into the field this week. On Monday he dedicated a bridge over the Rio Grande and shared a stage with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Vladimir V. Putin, in his first legislative initiative as Russia's elected president, today won approval of the long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start II from the lower house of Parliament. The landmark agreement, which was negotiated seven years ago, calls for cutting the American and Russian nuclear arsenals by half.</p> <p>The passage was seen as a sign that Mr. Putin seeks a constructive relationship with the West but also that he intends to resist the United States program to develop and deploy antimissile defenses.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Clinton administration today welcomed Russia's ratification of the nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start II, saying it sets the stage for President Clinton and President-elect Vladimir V. Putin to meet to try to hammer out a grand bargain for the next stage of arms control.</p> <p>Senior administration officials said they were that pleased Mr. Putin, unlike his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, demonstrated that he could deal with Parliament and that in the president-elect's appearance before the legislators he told them Russia could not afford an arms race.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Russian security agents arrested an unidentified American citizen and a Russian described as his accomplice on spying charges today, and were holding both men in Lefortovo Prison in Moscow.</p> <p>In a statement, the Russian domestic security agency accused the American, described as the head of a private company, of having ''deliberately established contacts over a long period with Russian scientists'' in order to obtain state secrets. The Russian was described as a specialist in the Russian defense industry.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics']	<p>The victory of Vladimir V. Putin in the presidential election last Sunday has focused attention on an opulent Moscow building known as Aleksandr House, where a team of liberal-minded economists and other experts has been quietly drafting Mr. Putin's blueprint for Russia.</p> <p>German O. Gref, head of the Center for Strategic Research and master of Aleksandr House, confidently predicted this week that by late May Mr. Putin will be ready to release ''a breakthrough scenario envisaging the most radical reforms,'' from an overhaul of Russia's cumbersome tax code to a streamlining of its infamous bureaucracies.</p>
['space', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>In a foreign policy speech to be delivered on Sunday, Vice President Al Gore gives one of his harshest assessments to date of Gov. George W. Bush, saying his Republican rival is stuck in a cold war time warp, has serious gaps in his experience and knowledge and would rely on isolationist, right-wing advisers for guidance.</p> <p>Mr. Gore faults Mr. Bush for proposing to ''skip'' a generation of military weapons while emphasizing research into more advanced ones, leaving the United States unprepared for battlefields of the next two or three decades, and for wanting to deploy an implausible ''Star Wars'' system.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'war and revolution']	<p>After six weeks of review, debate and bargaining at the annual session of the main United Nations human rights forum, which ended on Friday, China emerged free of condemnation of its human rights record while Russia and others were chastised.</p> <p>After it sidestepped bringing China to account for repression of political and spiritual dissenters, the United Nations Human Rights Commission voted to castigate Russia for its actions in Chechnya, the breakaway republic in the Caucasus.</p>
['treaties', 'war and revolution']	<p>In their first meeting as the new leaders of Russia and Japan, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori pledged today to meet often, to call each other by their nicknames and to try to conclude a long-sought peace treaty by the end of the year.</p> <p>Such a treaty would formally end decades of antagonism between the countries over a group of islands seized by Russia at the end of World War II. In making the pledge, both leaders were reaffirming the commitment of their predecessors to reach that goal.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Galina Kuzmichova endured the battle of Grozny. And now that the fighting is over she has done her bit to restore the Russian Orthodox church here, one of the city's foremost symbols of Russian culture.</p> <p>She has cleaned the icons and swept away the debris. But the church is still a ruin, and the Russian authorities have yet to take any steps to rebuild it.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'elections']	<p>In the first major test of a new and more centrist parliamentary majority, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin reached agreement today with his legislative allies to bring a long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty to a ratification vote in Parliament as early as Friday.</p> <p>Proponents of ratifying the treaty, known as Start II, predicted that they had the votes to win. The decision to move forward immediately with the vote in the wake of Mr. Putin's victory in the presidential election last month was hailed as a significant advance for arms control,  an agenda that a Communist-led coalition that dominated the Parliament has blocked for five years.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>In their battle to scuttle President Clinton's limited national missile defense system, Senate conservatives have a little-noted weapon -- a clause they inserted into another pact leaving it up to senators, and not President Clinton, to decide whether Russia inherited the Soviet role in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</p> <p>In all other matters, Russia has been treated as the legal successor state to the Soviet Union, taking the Soviet seat on the United Nations Security Council and assuming its responsibilities in other treaties.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>If President-elect Vladimir V. Putin is going to fight corruption and lawlessness in Russia, as he has vowed to do in the wake of his election last month, he might start here on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea.</p> <p>This territory of rolling farmland where Mr. Putin's wife, Lyudmila, grew up and where the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant devoted much of his life to the study of morality is about as corrupt as any in Russia.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Moving swiftly to gather the reins of power in Kremlin hands, President Vladimir V. Putin proposed legislation tonight that would oust Russia's provincial governors from their seats in Parliament and, in some instances, permit him to fire them altogether.</p> <p>The plan to redraw Parliament's upper house, called the Federation Council, would replace its 178 governors and regional legislative leaders with lower-level appointees from each of the nation's 89 regions.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>American proposals to change a key arms control agreement have revived some of the more important, if arcane, debates over nuclear strategy that not long ago seemed consigned to the dustbin of the cold war.</p> <p>One of those strategies is called ''launch on warning'' and is widely viewed as raising the risk of accidental nuclear war.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin named as prime minister today a chief foreign-debt negotiator and a liberal economics expert. The long predicted move, some experts said, bodes well for efforts to tame Russia's feral style of capitalism.</p> <p>That view was bolstered by a separate report today that Mr. Putin might abolish the Fuel and Energy Ministry as he reorganizes the cabinet. The immensely powerful agency has often been attacked as a seat of corruption and a brake on capitalist reforms.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>China's chief arms negotiator said today that the American proposal to build an anti missile defensive shield posed an unacceptable threat to China's security and could force Beijing to significantly expand its own nuclear forces in response.</p> <p>The Chinese find it hard to believe American claims that the proposed ''national missile defense'' is intended only to counter threats from small ''rogue'' states like North Korea, said the official, Sha Zukang, in an interview. But whatever the intention, he said, the systems under discussion would destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by neutralizing its relatively small force of nuclear missiles.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'medicine and health']	<p>When Dr. Hasan Baiyev was summoned to his hospital in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Kala on Feb. 1, he quickly learned that it was not for an ordinary case.</p> <p>As Russian troops tried to take the capital, Grozny, Chechen rebels began on Jan. 31 to fight their way out. Now hundreds of bloodied militants were waiting for treatment in Dr. Baiyev's village southwest of Grozny. They included Shamil Basayev, the most notorious of the Chechen warlords, who was wounded as he led his fighters through a Russian minefield.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Beneath a gilded sunburst in a gilded palace, his hand on a red, leather-bound copy of the Constitution, Vladimir V. Putin swore an oath today to ''respect and guard the human and civil rights'' of Russia and became, officially at last, its second president.</p> <p>Much of Russia -- and the world -- now waits to see what he will do with the title. Many expect a quick push to overhaul Russia's inscrutable tax code and economy and to reassert Kremlin rule over its 89 provinces -- goals supposedly too risky to chase when he was but an acting leader.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'elections']	<p>Declaring that the nation's security no longer required ''a nuclear balance of terror,'' Gov. George W. Bush called today for new -- and possibly unilateral -- reductions in American nuclear weapons coupled with a robust antimissile defense system.</p> <p>Though he shied from specifics, Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Responding to Gov. George W. Bush's criticism of the Clinton administration's policies on Israel, Vice President Al Gore today accused Mr. Bush's father of trying to pressure Israel to adopt positions it strongly opposed during his presidency.</p> <p>In a speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, Mr. Gore criticized the former president, George Bush, for seeking to withhold American loan guarantees to Israel in 1991 unless it agreed to stop building new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He called that policy an ''insulting concept'' intended ''to bully'' Israel.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States asked the Security Council today to impose sanctions on Ethiopia and Eritrea until fighting stops along their border.</p> <p>The proposed resolution would prohibit the sale or delivery of all kinds of weapons and military equipment to either side. It would also bar senior Ethiopian officials from international travel.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on Ethiopia and Eritrea in the hope that it will spur the two sides toward a resumption of peace talks.</p> <p>In a unanimous vote near midnight on Wednesday, the council barred sale and delivery of arms and other military equipment to the two countries for 12 months -- or until Secretary General Kofi Annan is able to report ''a peaceful, definitive settlement of the conflict.''</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia warned today that it might bomb targets in Afghanistan if the Islamic-led government there shelters and supports rebels fighting in Chechnya and former Soviet republics in Central Asia.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister and defense minister each suggested today that airstrikes might be carried out if the Taliban, the fundamentalist group that leads the Afghan government, supports Islamic militants fighting in the former Soviet Union.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>As the Clinton administration seeks a tenfold increase in money for Russian-American biological cooperation, the General Accounting Office has concluded that American support could inadvertently help Russian scientists and former weapons labs make germ weapons.</p> <p>In a new report, the G.A.O. presents no evidence that Moscow is conducting such illegal research or making germ weapons. Nor does the report state that American assistance to Russian labs and scientists is being diverted for military purposes. But Congress's auditing agency said that despite the administration's efforts to reduce the risks of such misuse or diversion, there is no way to prevent Russian scientists from ''potentially using their skills or research outputs to later work on offensive weapons activities at any of the Russian military institutes that remain closed to the United States.''</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Barring a sudden change of heart, President Vladimir Putin of Russia will do the United States a great service when he sits down with President Clinton this weekend and refuses to modify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense.</p> <p>Why does Russian opposition work in America's interest? We are still in the early stages of a serious debate over a national defense against missile attacks and, more broadly, over our nuclear strategy in the new century. Without a consensus on these important points, it is simply wrong to cut a deal with Moscow, either now or in the remaining months of the Clinton presidency.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'finances']	<p>Russia's lower house of Parliament ignored misgivings by political analysts and democracy advocates today and resoundingly endorsed a first draft of President Vladimir V. Putin's plan to concentrate state power in the Kremlin.</p> <p>The wave of support strongly suggests that Russia's upper house of Parliament, the Federation Council -- which stands to lose much of its power to the Kremlin should the plan pass -- will be more or less helpless to do anything about it.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The remarkable summit meeting between the Korean leaders this week has left the Clinton administration widely divided over North Korea's intentions, but has not so far diminished its resolve to move ahead with a missile defense, administration and defense officials say.</p> <p>Despite recent diplomatic forays that culminated in a general agreement between the Korean leaders to work for peace and unity on their divided peninsula, North Korea has not stopped work on the long-range missile program that has helped provoke proposals for the United States to build a defensive shield, the officials said.</p>
['television']	<p>In what looks to many here like a twilight struggle over the future of free speech, the Kremlin has handed one journalist over to Chechen guerrillas, demanded that newspapers obtain federal licenses and, on Tuesday, slapped Russia's leading press baron in a notoriously lice-ridden prison.</p> <p>But the litmus test of the Kremlin's intentions may be whether it tries to crack down on a bunch of grotesque, legless latex dolls.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'elections', 'television', 'news and news media', 'ethics']	<p>Russia's most powerful businessmen today condemned the arrest of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the owner of Russia's leading independent media conglomerate, and warned that it threatened the nation's hard-won freedoms.</p> <p>''Until yesterday we believed that we lived in a democratic country and today we have serious doubts,'' 17 tycoons said in a letter to Russia's prosecutor-general.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Vladimir V. Putin arrived here today, greeted by newspaper headlines like ''Putin the German'' that suggested the intense hopes vested by Germany in a Russian president who long resided in Dresden.</p> <p>That Mr. Putin speaks German --  learned during his K.G.B. days in East Germany -- has been impossible to ignore. ''The second German-speaking Russian leader after Lenin,'' enthused Die Zeit, noting that all of Mr. Putin's children have been sent to German schools.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Administration lawyers have advised President Clinton that, in their view, he could begin building the first piece of a national missile defense system without violating a 1972 arms control treaty with Russia, senior officials said.</p> <p>The lawyers' interpretations, which were drafted at the White House's request, are likely to be rejected by Russia, and the president has not made a decision on them. But they offer Mr. Clinton a way to announce that the United States would go ahead with missile defenses while letting the next administration decide whether to break the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>Leaving President Clinton behind in Moscow, Vladimir V. Putin came to Rome today to sell Europe -- and the Vatican -- on a Russian alternative to the United States missile defense proposal.</p> <p>The two-day trip was timed to follow his somewhat tense discussions with Mr. Clinton about altering the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. And it was choreographed to put Mr. Putin's heightened sense of Russian power on display. He left for Rome one hour before his American guest flew to Ukraine, kept John Paul II waiting 20 minutes and used his meeting with Italian officials as an opportunity to use Europe as a wedge in Russia's arms control negotiations with the United States.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'accidents and safety', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'energy and power']	<p>President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton today to announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the worst radiation accident in history, would be closed by Dec. 15.</p> <p>Mr. Kuchma made the announcement after the two leaders met in the white-and-gilded splendor of the Mariinsky presidential palace. ''This is a hopeful moment,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It is also a moment when we remember those who suffered as a result of the accident there.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>On a day largely devoted to displaying its political and fiscal mastery, the Kremlin issued its long-awaited plan to overhaul Russia's creaking economy today. True to predictions, it was the very model of modern Western economic theory.</p> <p>It was also considerably bolder than almost any plans that most Western nations have ever tried to push past suspicious voters and hardened special interests. But given the overwhelming popularity President Vladimir V. Putin is enjoying these days, outside experts say that for the moment, anyway, it actually has a chance to become law.</p>
['energy and power', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>A battle over Unified Energy Systems, Russia's electricity monopoly, intensified today after a group of foreign investors who oppose a plan to overhaul the company took their case to the Kremlin. The government controls more than half the company.</p> <p>Investors representing about 15 percent of the company's stock met with Aleksandr Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff. Mr. Voloshin, an important figure in President Vladimir V. Putin's administration, is also chairman of Unified Energy's board.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proposed today that his country be placed at the heart of Europe's defenses against missile attack. Mr. Putin warned that an American missile defense system would lead to a ''very dangerous'' arms race.</p> <p>Speaking to several hundred German business leaders in this capital that long stood at the epicenter of the cold war, Mr. Putin sought to portray Russia as a natural ally of Germany and the new Europe, while depicting the United States as insensitive to European concerns.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that prosecutors had gone ''too far'' in jailing the owner of Russia's largest independent media company two days ago.</p> <p>''I personally believe that this is excessive,'' Mr. Putin said during his state visit to Berlin. ''I think it should have been possible to handle this without an arrest.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>In a triumphant return home from his summit meeting with North Korea, President Kim Dae Jung told jubilant South Koreans today that ''a new day is beginning'' for their divided people.</p> <p>''When I was in Pyongyang, I realized Pyongyang is our land,'' Mr. Kim said in an address at the airport as he returned from three days of talks with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il. ''People in Pyongyang are our people. And they have deep-rooted love for their southern compatriots.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Arrayed behind George W. Bush as he unveiled his nuclear policy initiative last month were two former secretaries of state, two former national security advisers and a former secretary of defense.</p> <p>But once Mr. Bush and his formidable lineup of older men left the stage, the foreign policy expert who fielded questions on the specifics of the Texas governor's proposal was not Henry A. Kissinger or Colin Powell. It was Condoleezza Rice, a 45-year-old university professor who is tutoring a presidential candidate who concedes that he has much to learn about the world.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Clinton and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia concluded two days of talks today with mutual praise, but without narrowing the differences over the national missile defense system the United States wants to build.</p> <p>The summit meeting did produce two other narrow but significant agreements. One was an undertaking by the United States and Russia each to destroy 34 metric tons (about 75,000 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The other called for a joint center in Moscow to share early warnings about missile launching, a center that would be the first permanent American-Russia military operation.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Seeking to lower expectations, Clinton administration officials had insisted that two days of talks with President Vladimir V. Putin should not be viewed as an arms control summit meeting. But they were.</p> <p>The main purpose was to soften the Kremlin's resistance to American plans for a limited missile defense and to pave the way for a new arms control framework by the end of the Clinton presidency.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Hours before he flew to Moscow on Friday, President Clinton pointedly observed in a speech in Berlin that Westerners ''do not yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will endure.'' Today, with a few muted gestures, the White House illustrated what he meant.</p> <p>This morning, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Radio Liberty, the United States-financed broadcaster whose blunt coverage of the war in Chechnya last winter led to the Russians' detention of a top reporter, Andrei Babitsky.</p>
['energy and power', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Anatoly Chubais, the head of Russia's national electric company, said today that he would go ahead with a plan to reorganize the company despite opposition from foreign investors who say the plan will destroy the value of their holdings and deprive them of control over assets.</p> <p>The plan, presented in early April, proposes splitting off regional power plants and power generators from the company, Unified Energy Systems, to raise $30 billion in badly needed investment over 10 years. Some investors say the proposal may lead to sales of power plant assets at bargain prices, and that the plan should be halted.</p>
['television', 'news and news media']	<p>The Kremlin's chief prosecutor today arrested and jailed Vladimir A. Gusinsky, head of a media empire that has sharply criticized the government.</p> <p>The arrest roused fears of suppression of the press. But President Vladimir V. Putin, traveling abroad, insisted that the arrest was an unwelcome surprise to him.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Let us hear no more about the enigmatic Vladimir Putin. The president of Russia is as plain as a glass of tea. He is an autocrat in a tough spot, looking for order.</p> <p>Madeleine Albright called him ''one of Russia's leading reformers.'' So he is, but with a hyphen. His purpose is to re-form Russia, bringing it into the modern era as a nonideological descendant of its Soviet predecessor.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>About four months ago an old woman receiving me in a once-grand, now dust-filled and neglected St. Petersburg flat was assuring me that her son, who had been in prison for a year and a half, was being used to get at Vladimir Gusinsky, a media mogul who owns the magazine where I work. I attributed her words to an understandable desire to get me interested in her son's case, perhaps by exaggerating its significance on a national scale. She had my sympathy, but I did not write a story.</p> <p>I should have -- not because the government is now making an issue of this man's business ties to Mr. Gusinsky, but because his experience is a perfect example of the sort of extralegal practice that made Mr. Gusinsky's arrest possible.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media', 'biographical information']	<p>The owner of Russia's largest independent media conglomerate appeared on his NTV network today in a live call-in show and charged that he was arrested and jailed last week at the behest of President Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>''I am sure that Putin knew,'' said  the media owner, Vladimir Gusinsky. ''Moreover, the decision was made personally by Mr. President.''</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>I had breakfast recently with the deputy chief of Media-Most, the last major Russian TV-and-newspaper company to dare criticize or satirize the men who have ''democratically'' seized power in the Kremlin.</p> <p>Igor Malashenko was at first unusually guarded, speaking as if being overheard by the new K.G.B. I asked: What's with the clamming up? He responded by asking if I carried a cell phone. Sure, I said, but it was turned off; I prefer to be out of touch.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>The Clinton administration is exploring with some of its NATO allies and Russia the possibility that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia be allowed to leave office with guarantees for his safety and his savings, senior American and NATO officials say.</p> <p>The discussions are delicate and informal, the officials stress, emphasizing that the administration is not preparing any offer to Mr. Milosevic -- who has been indicted by an international war crimes tribunal -- and will not make one.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In his final visit to Moscow as president, Bill Clinton arrived here today and dined tonight with Russia's new president, Vladimir V. Putin, at the Kremlin palace, where the two leaders made a ''very serious and focused beginning'' on a full range of issues, including the search for a compromise on antimissile defense.</p> <p>During a nearly three-hour working dinner, the two men also discussed the American-Russian nuclear relationship, ongoing conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus, international trade and the state of the Russian economy, said a senior Administration official who sat in on the talks.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>''What do you want us to say,'' President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia asked today after his fourth meeting in three days with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, ''that we're in love?''</p> <p>He was joking, of course. But there was no mistake that the summit meeting that ended today produced a vigorous rapprochement between Russia and Germany. Mr. Putin seemed entirely serious when he added, ''Germany is Russia's leading partner in Europe and the world.''</p>
['elections']	<p>Russian parliamentary leaders said today that they are appealing to Belarus's autocratic president to allow the country's opposition parties to take part in all aspects of elections this fall.</p> <p>The appeal adds significant political weight to the message, already delivered by European leaders, that Russia shares concerns that the future of democracy is under threat in Belarus as repression rises. During the last year, some opposition leaders have disappeared, fled or been jailed on political charges, newspapers have been shut down and journalists have been harassed.</p>
['news and news media', 'finances']	<p>Gazprom, Russia's biggest company, began a campaign of pressure today against the owner of the nation's largest independent media conglomerate, demanding that his company repay a large debt.</p> <p>The move came a week after Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the media tycoon, was jailed on charges of embezzlement. He was released pending trial.  But he has expressed concern to associates that he will face more pressure, and President Vladimir V. Putin has called on Gazprom, a financial supporter, to take a tough stand toward Mr. Gusinsky's company.</p>
['espionage', 'computers and the internet']	<p>Against a backdrop of legal assaults on tycoons, harassment of free-thinking journalists and a general tightening of the state grip on things, Russia's leading pro-democracy political party now says federal intelligence agents are spying on it.</p> <p>Russia's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, has yet to comment on the  accusation, posted on the Web  site of Russia's Yabloko Party (www.yabloko.ru) and echoed in a scathing letter from Yabloko's leader, the federal legislator Grigory Yavlinsky.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin plans to visit North Korea next month, a move that underscores his active foreign policy and seems calculated to counter the Clinton administration's plan for a national missile defense.</p> <p>Russian officials said today that it would be the first trip by a Russian leader to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin convened a meeting with Russian tycoons today to impress on them that he, ultimately, is the one who runs the country.</p> <p>At the end of the session at the Kremlin, some business leaders said they were prepared to forgo special treatment and abide by government rules -- if the Kremlin would create a fairer business climate.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>At 77, President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan is a wily veteran of Soviet politics and of the K.G.B., an 18-year leader of Communist Azerbaijan and, for the last seven years, president of the newly independent country of the same name.</p> <p>He has some advice for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, a comparative political novice and former K.G.B. agent: deal with former Soviet republics as equals, not as client states with interests and policies subservient to those of Moscow.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'taxation', 'law and legislation']	<p>After two months of maneuvering, President Vladimir V. Putin and 89 of Russia's most powerful leaders -- the nation's czar-like regional governors -- faced off today in a long-anticipated political showdown.</p> <p>It was not even a contest.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'law and legislation']	<p>No one outside the Kremlin is quite sure why, or what it portends, or even whether it will last very long. But after nine long years of fabulous high living and seeming immunity from the rules that govern mere mortals, Russia's infamous tycoons have suddenly found themselves marked men.</p> <p>At least, some have. Whether they continue to be targets will say much about whether President Vladimir V. Putin's much-vaunted ''dictatorship of the law'' is in fact that or is more in the mold of the last Kremlin, where the rich played by their own laws.</p>
['news and news media', 'ethics']	<p>Prosecutors searched the offices of Media-Most, the nation's largest private media conglomerate, today for the second time in two months, stepping up a criminal investigation that skeptics call an effort to silence one of the Kremlin's few prominent critics.</p> <p>The prosecutors also sought documents from Gazprom, the huge state-run natural gas monopoly, which is Media-Most's biggest financial supporter, apparently as part of a continuing inquiry into the media company's finances.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Beijing tonight on the first stop of an Asian tour intended to revive his country's faded diplomatic role in the region and build what could become a Chinese-Russian axis to counter American influence.</p> <p>Mr. Putin is expected to sign at least six accords with Chinese leaders on Tuesday, including a joint statement with President Jiang Zemin condemning American proposals for missile defense systems over North America and Asia. Opposition to the American plan has accelerated a relationship that Russia and China describe as a ''strategic partnership'' intended to counter American power.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Boris A. Berezovsky, the archetypal Russian tycoon, politician and, until lately, a force within the Kremlin itself, said today that he would quit his seat in Parliament on Wednesday and try to form an alliance of big business and regional politicians aimed at curbing President Vladimir V. Putin's growing power.</p> <p>Mr. Berezovsky said flatly that he was resigning because ''I do not wish to take part in the dismantling of Russia and the imposition of authoritarian rule.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Bill Clinton today was a president caught between two summit meetings, one in Camp David dealing with the oldest and thorniest problems in diplomacy, the other in Japan approaching the newest and vaguest issues of global inequity.</p> <p>The meeting on the Maryland mountaintop was grueling, but Mr. Clinton was not going to leave while there was even a glimmer of hope that he might achieve a legacy-enhancing breakthrough in the pursuit of Middle East peace.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>In an announcement intended to remove the prime rationale for an American missile defense plan, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, said today that North Korea had offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into space.</p> <p>Mr. Putin announced the offer after a meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with that country's leader, Kim Jong Il. The visit was a first for a Russian president and was part of an intensive round of Asian diplomacy aimed at mobilizing opposition to the American antimissile plan. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin signed a joint statement with the Chinese denouncing the United States' plans for a missile defense.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin assembled both houses of Parliament and a national television audience today to present his assessment of the state of the nation. In a word, it was forbidding.</p> <p>After 10 years of independence, he said, Russians have built only ''the carcass of a civic society'' and have yet to shoulder such basic obligations as obeying laws. A falling birthrate and aging population threaten to make Russia ''a senile nation.'' The economy, which lately has perked up, actually is a house of cards supported by high oil prices.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'news and news media', 'ethics']	<p>Russian prosecutors today abruptly dropped their high-profile criminal inquiry into Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the Russian press tycoon whose Media-Most empire has been among the Kremlin's sharpest critics.</p> <p>Prosecutors did not explain why they had abandoned the investigation, which began with a spectacular May raid by ski-masked policemen and caused an uproar in June with Mr. Gusinsky's brief imprisonment on embezzlement charges. As recently as three weeks ago, prosecutors insisted to Parliament that Mr. Gusinsky had defrauded the government of at least $10 million.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'crime and criminals']	<p>Boris A. Berezovsky, the top Russian executive and onetime insider, who has denounced a Kremlin crackdown on rich businessmen, received a measure of vindication today when international auditors exonerated one of his companies in a long-running investigation into embezzlement and money laundering.</p> <p>But authorities here intend to press ahead with the investigation anyway, one of several that reflect an intensified scrutiny under President Vladimir V. Putin of the wealthy oligarchs that control much of the business in post-Soviet Russia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The presidents of China and Russia denounced the United States's proposed missile defense program in a joint statement today and vowed to strengthen a strategic partnership between their nations.</p> <p>But the first day of their summit meeting produced no substantive economic agreements, which Western scholars said pointed to a fundamental flaw in that partnership. Trade ties are more binding than talk in the post-cold-war era, and Russia cannot compete with what the United States, Europe or Japan can offer China these days, they said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation']	<p>The Russian authorities brought tax evasion charges against top executives at the country's biggest carmaker today as part of President Vladimir V. Putin's efforts to loosen the grip of Russia's richest men on the country's most profitable enterprises.</p> <p>The executives of the carmaker, AvtoVAZ, were charged a day after the authorities filed suit against managers at Russia's biggest oil company, also on charges of tax evasion. Since May, the authorities have swept through offices of media and oil companies and have brought charges against some of them.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'biographical information', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Earlier this summer, the newly elected Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, flew to Tatarstan to take part in the planting festival known as Sabantui. There he donned a Tatar hat, stuck his face in a vat of yogurt to bob for coins and then engaged a Tatar girl in arm wrestling.</p> <p>What happened next simply astounded Prof. Aleksandr B. Asmolov, a leading psychologist at Moscow State University, who watched on television as Mr. Putin, a black belt in judo, did not hesitate or politely feign a struggle, but simply slammed her arm to the table in a single overpowering motion.</p>
['terrorism', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and Russia have agreed to work together to draft and win support for expanded sanctions against Afghanistan, officials said today. The cooperation aims to force the ruling Taliban to end support of Islamic terrorists, the officials said.</p> <p>The pledge to expand United Nations sanctions against the Taliban, who control about 85 percent of Afghanistan, was among several measures endorsed in principle by a senior working group of American and Russian officials after two days of talks in Washington.</p>
['television', 'accidents and safety', 'elections', 'computers and the internet']	<p>By the late afternoon, most of the major World Wide Web news sites were no longer able to resist the struggle for life unfolding at the bottom of the Barents Sea.  While cable-news channels continued to feature drama-free images from the Democratic National Convention, on the Internet the news from the stricken Russian submarine had taken the lead position on the CBS, MSNBC, Fox News and CNN sites. ''No Signs of Life'' was the Fox site's headline.</p> <p>Of the major network sites, only ABC continued to cling to the convention as its lead item, offering the insight that, yes, now is the time for Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut to introduce themselves to the American people. As John Tyson, one of the vice president's college roommates, described it to MSNBC this evening, the final two days of the convention will provide ''a good strong dose of Al Gore.''</p>
['espionage']	<p>Russian officials denied bail today to Edmond Pope, 53, an American businessman held on espionage charges, rejecting his lawyer's argument that Mr. Pope has cancer and needs specialized medical treatment.</p> <p>Mr. Pope, a former Navy intelligence officer, was arrested in April on charges of trying to buy classified information about the design of a new super-fast torpedo from a Russian science professor. He faces trial in October.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russian officials' assertions yesterday that the submarine Kursk sank after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the kind of suspicions that were common during the cold war, when on more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged into one another.</p> <p>The Russians have long resented the fact that many of the collisions occurred in or near their waters and, in their view, amounted to hit-and-run jobs, as American and British spy submarines quickly fled to safety. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank, the Russian Navy  contends.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United Nations has assembled a new team of arms inspectors that is ready to enter Iraq within weeks, raising the prospect of another confrontation with President Saddam Hussein over his weapons programs.</p> <p>The creation of the new team comes more than two years after Mr. Hussein halted cooperation with a previous group of inspectors, provoking a diplomatic crisis that culminated in four nights of American and British airstrikes in December 1998.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'atomic energy']	<p>When Norwegian divers opened the emergency escape hatch on the sunken Russian submarine on Sunday, they had done in a day what Russian rescue workers had not managed in a week. The tragic story of the Kursk is only the latest evidence that Russia can no longer afford to maintain the technology created in the Soviet Union.</p> <p>The Kursk was a quintessential Soviet creation, huge as the superpower's ambition, equipped to destroy entire groups of vessels many times its own size -- and, of course, top-secret. But we now know that for years the sub has been going to sea without even the required emergency food and water supplies on board.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Speaking in somber tones and at times struggling for words, Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, offered a defense tonight of the military's failure to rescue the crew of the stricken nuclear submarine Kursk. In a nationally televised interview, he told Russians that the armed forces of the once-powerful Soviet empire had been ''robbed and stripped'' in the last decade and were operating on half the budget they required.</p> <p>After divers finally gained entry to the wreck of the nuclear submarine Kursk today and declared it flooded and its 118-member crew dead, the 68-year-old Marshal Sergeyev said he did not rule out the possibility that the military might have made mistakes in the rescue attempts.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya gestured toward the crowd that had gathered to wish him a happy 49th birthday at his heavily guarded home in this Chechen town.  Some, he noted dryly, could well be rebel agents.</p> <p>''They are everywhere and nowhere,'' Akhmad Kadyrov said with a shrug. ''Some of them might even be among these people.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>American and Russian officials dedicated a 10-acre industrial park today at what was until recently a nuclear-weapons factory east of Moscow. It was the second step in a joint project that American experts hope will provide jobs for up to 4,000 Russian weapons scientists and workers.</p> <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson attended the ceremony, in the once-closed nuclear city of Sarov, several hundred miles east of Moscow. The stop was part of a weeklong sweep through Russia and other former Soviet states in which Mr. Richardson is promoting programs to curb the spread of nuclear materials and technology.</p>
['television', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>A senior Russian official said today that the government-controlled company Gazprom is in negotiations to acquire the entire media empire of Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the Kremlin's most outspoken critic.</p> <p>Speaking in an interview, Vladislav Surkov, deputy head of the presidential administration, confirmed what had been a matter of speculation for days, that the gas giant Gazprom may take over Mr. Gusinsky's company, Media-Most.</p>
['religion and churches', 'biographical information']	<p>The Russian Orthodox Church today announced the canonization of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, and his immediate family for their ''humbleness, patience and meekness'' when they were imprisoned and executed by the Bolsheviks 82 years ago.</p> <p>The elevation of the last czar to sainthood has long been demanded by powerful right-wing factions in the church and had been the subject of considerable debate and controversy. Revered as a martyr and victim of Bolshevism by monarchists and conservatives, Nicholas is also blamed by many Russians for inept, inflexible and harsh rule that only hastened revolution.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>A Russian submarine plunged to the seabed in the Barents Sea on Sunday during a naval exercise, possibly after an explosion on board, officials said today.</p> <p>They said the submarine was badly damaged, and was trapped at least 450 feet below the surface. They said they did not know how many of the more than 100 crew members on board were alive or how long they could survive.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>As some Security Council members, led by Russia and the United States, move toward increasing sanctions on the militant Islamic government of Afghanistan, a report by the United Nations' relief coordinator there says that the existing economic embargo is having ''a tangible negative effect'' on efforts to help the Afghan people.</p> <p>A survey in mid-August by relief officials found that sanctions imposed in 1999 are stifling what international trade was left in a country still shattered by more than 20 years of civil war, severe drought and the frequently self-defeating economic strictures of the Taliban, the strict Islamic movement that seized power four years ago.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>The Pentagon and the State Department are sharply divided over how far work on a limited national missile defense system could proceed before the United States would be required to give formal notice that it was violating a crucial arms control treaty with Russia.</p> <p>Officials in the Pentagon and State Department said that disagreement within the administration was a primary reason for Defense Secretary William S. Cohen's delay in making a recommendation to President Clinton this month on the project.</p>
['espionage']	<p>The wife of an American who has been in jail here for five months on espionage charges came here today with her congressman to call on the Russian government to let Western doctors examine her husband, who has bone cancer.</p> <p>The woman, Cheri Pope, looked shaken and fatigued after visiting Lefortovo Prison, where her husband, Edmond, a former naval intelligence officer, has been incarcerated since early April. He was arrested for supposedly trying to buy classified plans for a high-technology Russian torpedo system.</p>
['war and revolution', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A dispute pitting the United States against Russia and France over Iraqi reparations to a Kuwaiti oil company has for the first time stymied the work of a United Nations compensation commission set up after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.</p> <p>At stake is a large claim of $21.6 billion submitted by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation for lost oil and gas sales resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, during which oil wells were destroyed or damaged.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>American officials said today that a warehouse bombed by American and British warplanes on Friday in southern Iraq held antiaircraft weapons and other military equipment, and not supplies of food as the Iraqis claimed.</p> <p>The officials also disputed Iraq's claims that a second attack on Saturday damaged a train station in the same town. In fact, they said, the Americans and British destroyed two antiaircraft batteries half a mile away.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>The Russian Orthodox Church adopted a social doctrine today that condemns genetic engineering, homosexuality, euthanasia and abortion, approves of the concept of private property and reconfirms the church's close relationship with the military.</p> <p>The doctrine was approved by the approximately 150 hierarchs of the Russian church, who are sitting as the Council of Bishops. On Monday, the council elevated the last czar, Nicholas II, and his family to sainthood, a move that had been sought by conservatives within the church.</p>
['accidents and safety']	<p>With a public confession tonight by President Vladimir V. Putin that he feels ''responsibility and guilt'' for the loss of the nuclear submarine Kursk, Russia's political evolution seems to be taking a new kind of post-Soviet turn.</p> <p>Military commanders are offering to resign. The government and the private sector are competing to raise millions of dollars for the families of the Kursk's crew. The airwaves are ringing with mea culpas from the haughty admirals of the once mighty Red Banner Fleet of the north.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Central Intelligence Agency says Iraq has consistently used the United Nations' oil-for-food program to reward countries that call for ending economic sanctions against Iraq, and to punish those that oppose lifting the embargo, administration officials familiar with the findings have said.</p> <p>The officials said the C.I.A. stated in a new report that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has given the bulk of contracts in the program to China, France and Russia, as well as to other vocal champions of lifting the sanctions. The Security Council imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 to force Iraq to give up weapons of mass destruction.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Protected by hundreds of policemen who all but sealed off a Moscow neighborhood, President Vladimir V. Putin visited the site of a bombed-out synagogue tonight to dedicate a $12 million Jewish community center -- a stone-and-glass demonstration, he said, of a new era of tolerance in Russia.</p> <p>It was a strong symbolic gesture of support by a Russian leader for a faith that suffered decades of persecution during Soviet times. But it also placed Mr. Putin once more in the middle of a bitter feud within Russia's reviving Jewish minority  -- and raised questions among critics about his motives.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>The United States has been pressing Russia not to proceed with plans to sell Iran laser technology that Washington says can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons, according to Administration officials.</p> <p>Officials said that since July President Clinton has raised the prospective sale of laser technology at least two times in meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin. The most recent occurred this month at the United Nations summit meeting.</p>
['atomic energy']	<p>After touring a secret nuclear submarine base on Russia's Pacific coast, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson indicated today that he would support a Kremlin request for help in building a high-security storage site for nuclear fuel from decommissioned Russian subs.</p> <p>Mr. Richardson and other American experts, including Assistant Secretary of Defense Ted Warner, were given broad access to the naval base at Petropavlovsk, on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where roughly 20 submarines already are docked and awaiting dismantling.</p>
['war and revolution', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In a concession to nations seeking to soften restrictions on Iraq, the Clinton administration agreed today to reduce the amount of money being set aside to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The money saved from the compensation fund would be used for relief projects for Iraqis.</p> <p>In return, Russia and France will allow a disputed reparations claim of $15.9 billion to be paid to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The White House said yesterday that Russia had suspended a contract to sell Iran sophisticated laser technology that Washington says can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons. But the Russian scientific institute involved says it still plans to make the sale.</p> <p>In an e-mail response yesterday to questions from The New York Times, Boris Yatsenko, director of the Science and Technology Center of Microtechnology, a unit of the government's D. V. Efremov Institute of St. Petersburg, said his institute was planning to sell the equipment, which he said was solely for ''medical, industrial, and scientific purposes.''</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>The Pentagon will probably postpone the next test of a national missile defense system until January, administration officials said today. Any decision to deploy the antimissile shield now seems certain to pass out of President Clinton's hands to his successor's.</p> <p>Administration officials had previously said Mr. Clinton would decide this summer on deploying a $60 billion antimissile system that would be ready by 2005. To meet that schedule, the Pentagon has been under heavy pressure for two years to conduct enough flights to show Mr. Clinton and his advisers whether the system was technologically feasible.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>Deadly clashes between guerrillas and the armies of two former Soviet republics in Central Asia last month are deepening concerns that an effort is under way to destabilize the region.</p> <p>Guerrillas operating from bases in Tajikistan staged several incursions into a remote mountainous region bordering Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Unconfirmed government reports said dozens of rebels and at least 30 soldiers from the two countries had been killed in the battles.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>After about two years of investigating the movement of billions of dollars through the Bank of New York, federal law-enforcement officials now say much of the money involved tax evasion by Russian businesses, and the investigators are prepared to help Moscow if Russia wishes to pursue its own cases.</p> <p>In what began as one of the biggest money-laundering investigations in United States history, law-enforcement officials have determined that much of the wrongdoing -- tax fraud and kidnapping -- appears to have occurred in Russia. The inquiry has also shown that the system for moving funds through the Bank of New York was used to transfer money to individuals connected with organized crime in Russia.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'russia-international relations-us', 'suits and litigation', 'ethics']	<p>Federal prosecutors today filed a civil suit contending that two Harvard University advisers who helped mold Russia's economic reforms in the mid-1990's misused their government-financed positions in pursuit of personal gain for themselves and their wives.</p> <p>The two advisers, Andrei Shleifer, a prize-winning economics star and tenured Harvard professor, and Jonathan Hay, a former Harvard legal expert, deny any wrongdoing. Harvard University, too, rejects the accusation that it failed in its obligation to supervise the advisers.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Insisting that it has never recognized an embargo on civilian air travel to Iraq, France today let a group fly from Paris to Baghdad.</p> <p>The flight, soon after two Russian flights to Baghdad, appeared to be intended to force the Security Council to reconsider its ban on air travel, which is part of the comprehensive sanctions that the United Nations imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Thousands of people across Serbia rallied today in protest against President Slobodan Milosevic as opposition leaders called on foreign governments, including Russia and Greece, to examine the disputed results of the presidential election last Sunday.</p> <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the opposition candidate, says he won the election outright, with more than 50 percent of the vote, but Mr. Milosevic's Federal Election Commission says that Mr. Kostunica fell short and that a runoff vote is required on Oct. 8.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As European leaders today applauded President Clinton's decision to defer building a missile defense shield over the United States, Russian officials expressed satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign to galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently helped persuade Mr. Clinton.</p> <p>A former Russian ambassador to the United States, Vladimir P. Lukin, who serves as deputy speaker of the parliament here, called Mr. Clinton's decision predictable and rational and said President Vladimir V. Putin had scored a temporary diplomatic victory. He cautioned, however, that the contentious international issue would return early next year.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'accidents and safety', 'news and news media']	<p>One of the country's media moguls, Boris Berezovsky, said today that a senior Kremlin official had ordered him to transfer his holdings in Russia's primary state-owned television channel to the state or face the prospect of going to jail.</p> <p>Mr. Berezovsky made this assertion in a letter addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin that was made available to news organizations today.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'accidents and safety', 'atomic energy']	<p>The sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk was a tragic but incredibly illuminating example of the transition the world, and Russia, are now going through from the cold-war system to the globalization system. Unfortunately, there's always some guy down the line who hasn't gotten the word yet. In this case it was Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>Yo, Putin, this ain't your father's Soviet Union anymore.</p>
['bombs and explosives']	<p>Russia is laying antipersonnel mines and reinforcing its defensive positions along the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, as Taliban fighters have moved their forces within artillery range of the Russian Army, which protects the gateway to Central Asia.</p> <p>A senior Russian official said on Sunday night that Moscow did not believe that the Taliban army was preparing an attack across the border.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>President Clinton called Yasir Arafat today to urge him to bring rioting in the West Bank and Gaza under control quickly. But Mr. Clinton received no assurances and no response to an invitation for Mr. Arafat to travel to Washington soon to map a way back to peace talks, administration officials said tonight.</p> <p>Mr. Clinton planned to speak with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel promptly, the officials said, with a similar call for restraint and an invitation to a separate meeting with the president. But officials said the two leaders had not been able to speak.</p>
['terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>In June 1995, Vice President Al Gore signed a secret agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, calling for an end to all Russian sales of conventional weapons to Iran by the end of 1999.</p> <p>But the deadline passed with no sign of a halt to such sales, despite repeated complaints late last year and this year to senior Russian officials by Mr. Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. Moscow continues to be a significant supplier of conventional arms to Tehran despite the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, the Central Intelligence Agency reported in August.</p>
['foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Gov. George W. Bush's accusation that aid money from the International Monetary Fund lined the pockets of a former Russian prime minister was denied today by the monetary fund and the former Russian official, raising questions about Mr. Bush's pointed charge in Wednesday's otherwise cordial discussion of foreign policy issues.</p> <p>The comments about misused aid reflect growing skepticism among many Congressional Republicans about the role of the I.M.F., which some critics have accused of wasting billions and supporting corrupt governments.</p>
['terrorism', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>State Department officials told Congress today that a 1995 deal approved by Vice President Al Gore allowing Russia to sell a large cache of conventional weapons to Iran was legal and did not threaten American security.</p> <p>The agreement, signed in 1995 by Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, exempted Russia from a law requiring that economic sanctions be imposed on countries that sell arms to nations that sponsor terrorism, including Iran.</p>
['elections', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Gov. George W. Bush said today that he was troubled by a report that Russia was continuing to deliver conventional arms to Iran in violation of a deal signed by Vice President Al Gore in 1995.</p> <p>Republican members of Congress also reacted angrily to the report, published today in The New York Times. It said that Mr. Gore entered into an agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister then, that in essence exempted Russia from a 1992 law requiring sanctions against nations that sell advanced weapons to countries that sponsor terrorism, including Iran.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Novokuznetsk Aluminum Plant here turns out 276,000 tons of metal a year, more than 10 percent of Russia's total production and enough to build more than 3,500 Boeing 747's.</p> <p>It makes a profit on every ton by selling its ingots abroad for foreign currency after processing it in Russia, where workers' wages and supplies are priced in rubles far below world cost.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>Bowing to a vast popular revolt against him, a pale Slobodan Milosevic resigned tonight as Yugoslavia's president, ending 13 years of rule that have brought his country four wars, international isolation, a NATO bombing campaign and his own indictment on war crimes charges.</p> <p>Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer of quiet habits and a firm belief in a future for Yugoslavia as a normal country within Europe, is expected to be inaugurated as president on Saturday.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Israelis and Palestinians backed haltingly away from confrontation today as armed clashes subsided and a parade of diplomatic visitors urged both sides to rein in violence.</p> <p>For the first time in 12 days the violence began to subside. The most serious casualty today was a 12-year-old Palestinian boy in Gaza, who was critically wounded. Street battles between Israeli troops and rock-throwing Palestinian protesters were confined largely to Gaza and the West Bank city of Ramallah, where volleys of Israeli rubber bullets wounded dozens of Palestinians.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>It has been half a year since the United States relaxed the 1987 embargo on Iranian carpets, caviar and pistachio nuts in what it called a goodwill gesture toward improved relations with Iran. But so far, only the carpets have had a renaissance in the American market -- which is good news for some people, bad for others.</p> <p>Iran's Caspian caviar was once revered as the finest, but no longer, said Bruce Sobol, co-owner of Caviarteria Inc. of New York, a leading importer and distributor of Caspian caviar: ''It's not markedly better than Russian, there's less of it, and it's more expensive.'' He is, however, receiving inquiries from customers eager to buy ''because it has been unavailable.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'news and news media']	<p>Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, looked down the gorgeous hall in the Kremlin of which he was now master. Seated before him, on a muggy summer day, were some 30 men who represented the better part of Russia's capitalist class. They were known as oligarchs, from the Greek-derived ''oligarchy,'' meaning rule of the few. In the Yeltsin era of the 1990's, so much power passed into their hands that the word had fit them like a glove. Putin -- a diminutive man who had made lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B. -- was here to tell them that their rule was over.</p> <p>''You built this state yourselves, to a great degree,'' he began, ''through the political or semipolitical structures under your control, so there is no point in blaming the reflection in the mirror.'' The attack was the verbal equivalent of deashibari -- a judo move designed to throw the opponent instantly -- which Putin has said is his favorite gambit. They were, in truth, already off balance. The oligarchic period had made them all very rich. But for most of them, it was an unstable, robber-baron kind of wealth that could be snatched away at any time. Not far from the gilded hall, they knew, Putin was keeping kompromat on them, material gathered by the security agencies on their rise to wealth -- piles that were, a Putin adviser said, ''meters high.''</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>In a new memoir, former President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia says that he had all but decided in 1996 to upend the democratic process in Russia by banning the Communist Party, dissolving Parliament and postponing presidential elections he seemed certain at the time to lose.</p> <p>With his approval rating bottomed out at 3 percent, the Russian leader says, he came to the conclusion that he was not ''able to manage the crisis within the framework of the current Constitution'' and though he knew he would ''pay a heavy price in credibility,'' he ordered decrees drafted that would have effectively turned his rule into a dictatorship.</p>
['energy and power', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>As Serbia's opposition vowed to shut the country down on Monday, several hundred policemen, apparently sent to try to keep electricity production going, tonight surrounded and entered an important coal mine that went on strike on Friday.</p> <p>The strike is part of the opposition's campaign to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat in the Sept. 24 elections to the challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. The coal mine supplies an electrical power station at Obrenovac, which produces up to half of Serbia's electricity in a system patched together after NATO bombing campaign last year. At least 4,500 coal workers are on strike, and the general manager of part of the mine, Slobodan Jankovic, resigned earlier today, throwing his support to the workers.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today took a high-profile tour of India's leading nuclear research center, where reactors and bombs are designed, and promised to work with India in developing peaceful uses for atomic energy while encouraging India to sign the nuclear nonproliferation and test ban treaties.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's hour-and-a-half visit to the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Bombay was the last stop on his four-day trip to India. It suggested how far India has come in regaining international acceptance since it conducted nuclear tests in May 1998.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>The winding road from the capital ends here, for anyone who would not like to risk becoming the hostage of a warlord named Umar.</p> <p>Barely 20 miles from Dushanbe, the capital, four young mujahedeen fighters brandish Kalashnikov rifles at a checkpoint a quarter-mile from Mr. Umar's base, in a former auto-repair factory surrounded by cotton fields and persimmon orchards.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics']	<p>The factories built as part of the great Soviet industrialization undertaken for Stalin, Georgia's native son, stand empty. The ugly concrete apartment houses for the workers are crumbling. The shops display few wares, and every traffic light is off to save electricity.</p> <p>Only the soup kitchen seems to be thriving as a line snakes out the door.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Taking center stage in the country that preoccupied and bedeviled her political campaign, Hillary Rodham Clinton met here today with the president and prime minister of Israel and delivered an emotional eulogy for Leah Rabin, who died of cancer on Saturday.</p> <p>In her remarks at the hillside gravesite, which were televised, Mrs. Clinton, the Senator-elect of New York State, made a plea to revive the peace effort begun by Mrs. Rabin's husband, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated five years ago.</p>
['elections']	<p>Two or three times a year a manila envelope marked with the words ''Official Election Absentee Balloting Material -- First Class Mail'' arrives at my Soviet-era apartment block here.</p> <p>Inside are a voter's pamphlet, a pink absentee ballot and two smaller envelopes, one of which fits neatly inside the other. And though I would like to exercise my duty as an American citizen and cast my ballot by returning it to Pierce County, Wash., there is always a problem. I am supposed to postmark the ballot by Election Day, but inevitably it arrives too late. The one for this year's election, on Nov. 7, showed up Nov. 9.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>IT was a fortnight so fraught as to seem surreal, a standoff scholars have come to call the most dangerous moment in recorded history. Thirty-eight years ago this autumn, as the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear conflict over missiles in Cuba, John F. Kennedy and his men groped for a way to avoid the end of the world as they knew it.</p> <p>Those two weeks in October 1962 are among the most analyzed hours in American diplomatic and political history, the subject of reams of scholarly books and articles, memoirs, oral histories and a television docudrama, ''The Missiles of October'' (1974). Many of the deliberations among the president and his advisers were recorded verbatim. So recapturing the taste and feel and rhythms of that time in a way that seems both faithful and fresh is no easy effort. But that is the task that ''Thirteen Days,'' a big-budget Hollywood film opening Dec. 20, sets for itself.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>It is probably unfair to read much into the fact that on the last day of the three-day visit here of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, President Jacques Chirac changed his schedule to fly to Cherbourg and visit the spot where a chemical tanker had just sunk in the English Channel.</p> <p>But there is no question that the leaky tanker was making a lot more headlines than the president of Russia. That was in part owing to the relatively low-key nature of Mr. Putin's first visit to France, a country he had snubbed since taking office because it was so vocal in denouncing Russia's war in Chechnya.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid', 'ethics']	<p>Western powers gave tens of billions of dollars in aid to Russia with no comprehensive strategy, and, at least partly as a result, the programs failed to bring about the desired capitalist transition there, a Congressional study has concluded.</p> <p>The study, by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, raises questions about what has arguably been the highest foreign policy priority of the United States: making sure Russia did not become hostile after the collapse of Communism in 1991. Many Clinton administration officials supported a huge amount of international aid and a ''big bang'' approach to change in which Russia was encouraged to sell state companies rapidly and overhaul banks as a way of making the nation both capitalist and democratic -- and of ensuring that Communists could never regain control of the economy.</p>
['terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia has notified the Clinton administration that it intends to withdraw from a 1995 agreement negotiated by Vice President Al Gore limiting Russian sales of tanks and other conventional weapons to Iran, officials said today.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright of the intended action four days before the presidential election.</p>
['espionage']	<p>A lawyer for an American businessman charged with espionage said today that the judge hearing the case had admitted a crucial piece of evidence that could help to exonerate him.</p> <p>The lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, said the judge let the defense submit documents today showing that the businessman, Edmond Pope, and a professor at Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin, had been trading unclassified information about torpedo technology when they were arrested in April.</p>
['energy and power']	<p>The chief executive of Russia's national power company, Anatoly B. Chubais, has joined forces with the governor of this vast Siberian region to resolve a simmering dispute over the price of electricity here.</p> <p>On a three-day visit to Krasnoyarsk, a region rich in resources that is five times the size of France, Mr. Chubais pressed for the application of a price increase that has been suspended since an aluminum company took it to court in September.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>The hijacked Russian plane landed in the desolate Negev shortly after sunrise this morning like an abrupt announcement of another bad week.</p> <p>Because it seemed at first to be linked to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it heightened a prevalent feeling here that this tense, open-ended period is bound to be defined by unpredictable and unsettling events.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Kevin Costner is suitably flinty in ''13 Days,'' a competent, by-the-numbers recreation of the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. This is an attempted man's man drama, a void that needs to be filled since Mel Gibson is wearing pantyhose this season.</p> <p>Mr. Costner is Kenny O'Donnell, the right hand of John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his brother Robert (Steven Culp), and he is so close by the Kennedys' side that you half expect him to trip over the many biographers who must have been been lurking around the White House like ninjas.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>Russia's Parliament voted 381 to 51 today to restore the Soviet national anthem as the state hymn -- its words to be rewritten -- and to bring back the Soviet red banner -- without the hammer and sickle -- as the official flag of the armed forces.</p> <p>The legislation, submitted earlier this week by President Vladimir V. Putin and intended to set state symbols into law as provided by the Russian Constitution, retains the 300-year-old Russian tricolor of white, blue and red as the state flag, and the czarist era double-headed eagle as the national seal.</p>
['espionage']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that he would accept the recommendation of his presidential pardon commission to set free Edmond Pope, the former naval intelligence officer sentenced to 20 years for alleged espionage this week.</p> <p>His release is expected as early as Thursday.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>There arrived a moment in his presidency when Bill Clinton's view of America's role in the world grew up in a hurry.</p> <p>It came on a frigid January day in 1995. Robert E. Rubin, who had just been sworn in as treasury secretary, followed Mr. Clinton into the Oval Office to deliver some bleak news.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>A Moscow judge today handed down the maximum sentence of 20 years at hard labor against a former American naval intelligence officer, Edmond Pope, after a seven-week espionage trial behind closed doors.</p> <p>The 54-year-old businessman was accused last April of obtaining secret plans and technical reports for Russia's rocket-propelled Shkval -- or Squall in English -- torpedo, which travels at 230 miles an hour.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Fresh from a visit to Cuba, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia visited Canada today and lined up its support for strengthening a cold war treaty that the Russians see as blocking an American national missile defense system.</p> <p>''Canada and the Russian Federation agree that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty is a cornerstone of strategic stability,'' read the joint communique signed by Mr. Putin and by Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada. In a diplomatic offensive directed at American allies this year, the Russians have argued that the treaty rules out the kind of missile defense system advocated by President-elect George W. Bush.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'news and news media', 'biographical information']	<p>Acting on a request from Moscow, Spanish authorities arrested the embattled Russian news media magnate Vladimir V. Gusinsky at his house in southern Spain late Monday.</p> <p>Russia had issued the warrant after Mr. Gusinsky failed to show up for a hearing in Russia, where he is being investigated on fraud charges.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq was in town doing some lobbying on behalf of President Saddam Hussein last month, and while he was here, he took the opportunity to say on national television what several former Soviet client states may have been wanting to say for a long time.</p> <p>''For the last 10 years, some people have held jobs in the Russian government without knowing the country's history of relations'' with its Soviet-era friends, Mr. Aziz said. ''Many of them viewed the West as the sole way to resolve Russia's problems.''</p>
['espionage']	<p>The chairman of Russia's presidential pardon commission predicted tonight that the panel would quickly recommend the release of Edmond Pope, the American businessman convicted of espionage on Wednesday.</p> <p>The chairman, Anatoly I. Pristavkin, a 69-year-old Soviet-era writer who heads the panel that makes recommendations on pardons to President Vladimir V. Putin, predicted at the Kremlin today that Mr. Pope's appeal, signed this morning at Lefortovo Prison, would be acted upon swiftly after the panel meets on Friday morning.</p>
['terrorism', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and Russia asked the Security Council today to toughen and broaden sanctions against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, measures that would cut the country off from most contact with the world.</p> <p>The common ground taken by the Russians and Americans in demonizing the Taliban follows their taking exactly opposite sides in the catastrophic civil war that followed the Soviet invasion of 1979.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'medicine and health']	<p>Natalia Kostina lay flat on her back on a metal examining table in this city's tuberculosis hospital, staring impassively at the ceiling. In an instant, a doctor jabbed into her abdomen a thick needle attached to a syringe and pushed in a few cubic inches of air.</p> <p>A moment later the needle was withdrawn and Ms. Kostina, silent and stoic, got off the table and returned to her room. Her treatment was over for another week.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia brought his capitalist road show to Canada's business capital today, promising investor security, low tax rates and renewed economic growth.</p> <p>''Attracting foreign investment is seen by us as a major factor for integrating Russia in the world economy,'' Mr. Putin told a luncheon audience of nearly 2,000 people. ''We have expanded the legal framework to improve protection of investors' rights.''</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Led by the United States and Russia, the Security Council imposed harsh new sanctions on the Taliban government of Afghanistan today, leaving the United Nations profoundly split over the human and political damage the measures could inflict on one of the world's poorest nations.</p> <p>The vote in the 15-member Council was 13 for the embargo, with China and Malaysia abstaining.</p>
['espionage']	<p>As the spy trial of a former American naval intelligence officer nears its end here, American and Russian experts say the technology that he was trying to acquire, a rocket-propelled torpedo that travels 230 miles an hour underwater, represented a significant advance in submarine warfare. No similar weapon exists in Western navies, the experts said.</p> <p>The legal battle at the closed trial of former officer, Edmond Pope, which began on Oct. 18 under protest from the United States, appears to turn on whether the technical reports at issue were classified. Mr. Pope was arrested along with a professor at Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin, and has been held in a cell here.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'atomic energy', 'credit', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'energy and power']	<p>President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine is having one of the worst ordeals of his long political career.</p> <p>First, he is facing the monumental task on Dec. 15 of closing the last reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the 1986 fire and radiation catastrophe. But the shutdown threatens further power cuts for millions of Ukrainians already shivering because of storms and equipment breakdowns.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Edmond Pope, an American businessman and retired naval intelligence officer who had been convicted of espionage by a Russian court and sentenced to 20 years in prison, was pardoned today by President Vladimir V. Putin and was immediately flown out of Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Putin said in his decree that he had granted the pardon because of Mr. Pope's health problems and because he wanted to preserve good relations with the United States.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>China and Russia are working on a treaty proclaiming friendship, the strongest sign yet of their shared unhappiness with the supremacy of the United States and its plans to build a shield against ballistic missiles.</p> <p>There is no sign that China and Russia plan to enter a genuine alliance, with mutual pledges of aid in time of war, say Chinese and Western scholars and diplomats.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'economic conditions and trends', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>President-elect George W. Bush said today that he planned to review and possibly roll back some of the most ambitious initiatives that President Clinton has taken in recent days, including regulations that put nearly 60 million acres of the nation's forests off limits to development.</p> <p>''I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration,'' Mr. Bush said of his own land use policies. In an interview, he emphasized that ''we've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity'' to reverse actions Mr. Clinton has taken in the waning weeks of his presidency.</p>
['ethics']	<p>A Russian official who was detained last week on a Swiss warrant accusing him of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Swiss companies doing renovations in the Kremlin was denied bail yesterday by a judge in New York.</p> <p>The decision came even though the Russian ambassador stood up before a federal judge and personally guaranteed that the official, Pavel P. Borodin, would return to court if freed.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'freedom and human rights', 'war and revolution', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin sent a letter to President Bush this week proposing broader Russian-American cooperation and setting out the major issues on which he believes the two countries can cooperate, the Kremlin's news service said today.</p> <p>Mr. Putin sent the letter on Tuesday, along with a second note to former President Bill Clinton expressing gratitude for his ''constructive and well-meaning approach'' to Russian-American relations, a Kremlin spokesman said.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>Treading into national security policy after a week devoted to education, abortion and tax cuts, President Bush said today that he intended to keep his campaign pledge to reduce the nation's nuclear weapons as he moved ahead with construction of a defense against ballistic missiles.</p> <p>Mr. Bush repeated a proposal he made last spring and suggested he would proceed with reductions in nuclear warheads and the construction of a missile defense as a way to spur new arms-control negotiations with the Russians .</p>
['news and news media']	<p>His defenders insist otherwise, and they may yet be right. But there are growing signs that the battle to control Vladimir Gusinsky's Media-Most press empire -- and by extension, the last nationwide voice critical of President Vladimir V. Putin -- is near endgame, and that Mr. Putin's allies smell victory.</p> <p>Media-Most's largest creditor, the state-controlled Gazprom natural-gas monopoly, formally said today that it planned to appoint its own board of directors for the company after a Moscow court decision on Thursday that, Gazprom said, gives it control of Media-Most.</p>
['television', 'finances']	<p>Talks between Russia's largest independent television network and its main creditor deteriorated further today after the creditor pulled out of an agreement with an international investment bank to sell a stake in the network.</p> <p>The dispute, which for months has pitted the Russian media entrepreneur Vladimir Gusinsky against the government, flared up this week after each side accused the other of violating a crucial contract signed last year. Though negotiations have not broken down entirely, the problems have cast a shadow over talks with foreign investors, including Ted Turner, on the purchase of a stake in the television network, NTV. Mr. Gusinsky founded NTV, which is part owned by his company, Media-Most. Gazprom, the government-controlled gas company, is NTV's largest shareholder.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Senior NATO generals, United Nations officials and Western diplomats say they believe that the American role in Kosovo is as crucial now as ever, and they assert that President-elect George W. Bush's expressed desire to pull American troops out of the Balkans is both ill-timed and damaging to Western goals in the region.</p> <p>American troops perform more than a military function, they emphasize, and their presence alone serves as the best deterrent not only to Serbia, but also to ethnic extremists on both sides in a period of major political change.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>It was on the last day of Passover 51 years ago that the K.G.B. seized Yitzakh Kogan's grandfather for the high crime of baking kosher matzo.</p> <p>''It was impossible to bake matzo in Leningrad,'' the grandson said. ''It was the law of city. And he had made it for all the Jews.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>I too have had a White House  sleepover  in the bomb shelter. I was reminded of that night by ''13 Days,'' the new film about the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis in October, 1962. During the crisis, I was an aide, one of nine people working in the Kennedy White House press office.</p> <p>I first realized something portentous was going on when, on a presidential trip to Chicago, we abruptly returned to Washington. There were rumbles about the real reason for our change in travel plans, which had been attributed to Mr. Kennedy's having a cold. None of us in the press office were privy to the fact that five days earlier, aerial reconnaissance photographs had revealed Soviet missiles in Cuba. It was not until our preparations for the president's address to the American people a day or two later that lower-eschelon staff people like myself began to recognize the high-wire act the president was engaged in.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, left Moscow tonight like a smiling creditor who got what he wanted from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who saw off his guest with an affirmative airport declaration: ''We intend to pay and will pay the debts of the former Soviet Union.'' About $20 billion of the $48 billion in Soviet-era debt is held by Germany.</p> <p>After a festive weekend of negotiation, religious services celebrating the Eastern Orthodox Christmas, motor touring and even sleigh riding through the snowy Russian countryside, the two leaders, and their wives, Doris and Lyudmila, parted company today in high spirits. But neither indicated that a solution had been found to Russia's imminent default on $1.5 billion in debt payments due in the first quarter of the year.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Taiwan has signaled that it may ask the Bush administration to sell it four Kidd-class guided-missile destroyers to counter China's recently purchased Russian-made destroyers, the second of which is now steaming toward the Taiwan Strait.</p> <p>The request, likely to be made before the United States and Taiwan hold annual talks on arms sales in April, would present George W. Bush with his first major challenge in managing the delicate balance of relations between China and Taiwan.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Colin Powell's State Department, nibbling its nails about anti-globalist protests, warned Americans about traveling to the World Economic Forum in dangerous Davos, where the elite meet to not compete. But intrepid opinionmongers trekked into these Alps to learn how Chinese and Russian leaders react to Bush administration plans for a missile defense.</p> <p>Internal political paranoia in Beijing inclines its leaders to make a deal. Lee Kuan Yew, dictator of Singapore, recently cracked down on Falun Gong adherents who were stretching and breathing deeply in a public park without a permit. That showed the believers who was boss in the shopping-mall nation, but unlike the insecure dictators in China, Lee did not imprison, torture or murder them.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'demonstrations and riots', 'international trade and world market', 'bombs and explosives', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>On his first overseas trip as America's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell plunged into talks today with the Russian foreign minister over differences on plans for a missile defense. They agreed to hold an expert-level dialogue on both offensive and defensive weapons, officials on both sides said.</p> <p>The 90-minute discussion with Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, who met General Powell at his initial stop in Cairo, was part of a three-day tour by General Powell of five Arab countries, the Palestinian territories and Israel. The Bush administration describes the tour as part of a reassessment of American policy in which it hopes to gain new support for sanctions against Iraq.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit']	<p>ANOTHER emerging-markets crisis erupted last week. But while it rattled many foreign markets a bit, by the time Turkey devalued its currency on Thursday by letting it float freely, it appeared that there would be little lasting fallout from this rocky episode.</p> <p>But if you invest in these risky markets, don't take that as much comfort. Turkey is small potatoes. Its bonds make up only 1.9 percent of the closely watched Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus compiled by J. P. Morgan. Argentina's bonds are 23.1 percent of this index. And Turkey, unlike Russia in 1998, was not a place where hordes of foreign investors had flocked in hopes of big returns -- and then tried to leave all at once.</p>
['religion and churches', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Internal security authorities here are keeping a watchful eye on the activities of mullahs from neighboring Iran, nervous that the religious presence could translate into political instability.</p> <p>Government officials and Western diplomats said Iranian religious leaders have raised their profile in recent months, conducting a mass wedding for 2,000 poor people, holding a political rally and financing construction of the largest mosque in the Caucasus.</p>
['foreign aid', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia pledged this week that it would finally begin destroying 40,000 tons of lethal chemical weapons -- the largest stockpile in the world -- this summer, Western officials said.</p> <p>In meetings with José Bustani, who heads the secretariat that enforces the Chemical Weapons Convention signed by 130 countries, Zinovy Pak, director of the Russian Munitions Agency, said funds for the destruction of chemical arms had been increased sixfold this year to $105 million. A plan to begin operating the first of three destruction plants will be presented to President Vladimir V. Putin next month.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>After months of protesting the American plan to develop an antimissile system, Russia has begun to talk more seriously about the possibility of missile defenses.</p> <p>The Russians are still deeply unhappy about the Bush administration's decision to build a missile shield. Moscow's ideas on how to develop a missile defense are also sketchy and a far cry from the more ambitious system that the United States is most likely to design.</p>
['terrorism', 'freedom and human rights', 'espionage']	<p>Viktor Cherkashin wears the Russian face of the cold war: A piercing stare, and the intimidating presence of a brilliant actor, which of course is a necessary tool of any successful spy. But it was his careful approach to clandestine operations that made him such a tough adversary to the Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p> <p>As a colonel in the K.G.B., Mr. Cherkashin was instrumental in handling both Aldrich H. Ames, who spied for nine years from within the heart of the Central Intelligence Agency, and, federal law enforcement officials now say, Robert Philip Hanssen, who is accused of spying for more than 15 years from inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Less than a week before he meets President Bush in Washington, the president of South Korea today publicly took Russia's side in the debate over Washington's plan for a national missile defense.</p> <p>A joint communiqué issued by President Kim Dae Jung with the visiting president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, declared that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which would be threatened by Washington's project, was a ''cornerstone of strategic stability.'' The treaty should be preserved and strengthened, the communiqué said.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'espionage']	<p>A Russian intelligence source warned the United States in the mid-1990's that Moscow had a spy inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but investigators were unable to track the lead to Robert Philip Hanssen, the F.B.I. agent who was arrested on Feb. 18 on espionage charges, intelligence and law enforcement officials said today.</p> <p>The tip from the Russian official prompted the F.B.I. to briefly begin a counterintelligence inquiry within its own ranks, officials said. But the investigation was abandoned after the same Russian source returned, several months later, and told the Americans that Moscow's agent was in the Central Intelligence Agency, not the F.B.I.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'religion and churches', 'bombs and explosives', 'news and news media', 'espionage']	<p>The domestic intelligence agency unexpectedly said today that an American graduate student, arrested nearly a month ago on seemingly minor drug charges, was probably working for United States military intelligence.</p> <p>The arrest of the student, John Edward Tobbin, a Fulbright scholar who is believed to be 23 or 24, drew almost no notice when it was reported two weeks ago in Moscow newspapers here. But today the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor to the K.G.B., said that Mr. Tobbin had studied Russian at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., and had been trained in interrogation at the Army military intelligence training center in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.</p>
['medicine and health', 'demonstrations and riots', 'immigration and refugees', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism']	<p>Alone among major industrial countries, the United States will continue to grow markedly in population during the next half century, a result of the largest intake of immigrants anywhere and a higher fertility rate than that of other rich nations, says a United Nations analysis to be published Wednesday.</p> <p>By 2050 the United States will be the only developed country among the world's 20 most populous nations, an international team of demographers predicts. In 1950 at least half of the top 10 were industrial nations. In 2000 there were still three, including Japan and Russia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare']	<p>Leaders of the new government in Serbia suggested today that the arrest of the former secret police chief this weekend would inevitably lead investigators to Slobodan Milosevic, who is widely blamed for instigating the Balkan wars of the last decade and is seen by Serbs as the cause of their isolation and impoverishment.</p> <p>Mr. Milosevic, who was forced out as president of Yugoslavia in October, has been indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague for atrocities apparently committed by security forces in the 1999 Kosovo war; Serbs say he should also stand trial in Serbia for misdeeds ranging from electoral fraud to vast corruption.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is to arrive here on Monday to cement deals for his hard-pressed economy. It is the first visit by a Russian leader since Boris N. Yeltsin came in 1992.</p> <p>The Russians are just as eager now to expand economic ties, and to find a way to pay off debts that have grown to $1.8 billion. But they may also be looking for a chance to expand their role on both sides of the demilitarized zone that has divided the peninsula since the Korean War.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'bombs and explosives', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>George W. Bush's foreign policy so far has made three mistakes and missed one opportunity.</p> <p>1. Pretending the easing of economic pressure on Iraq is the imposition of ''smart sanctions.'' Apparently Bush has decided to cave in to France, Russia and Syria and permit resumption of business-as-usual with Saddam Hussein. The trick is to acquiesce while looking fierce; hence our pinprick bombing of radar sites.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'espionage', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>When  Col. Vitaly Yurchenko of the K.G.B. walked into the United States Embassy in Rome on Aug. 1, 1985, he brought with him what appeared to be the solution to one of the most troubling mysteries facing the United States intelligence community.</p> <p>Mr. Yurchenko revealed that a C.I.A. officer who had been fired just before he was to be posted to Moscow had become a spy for the K.G.B., the Soviet secret police and intelligence apparatus. Mr. Yurchenko knew him only as Mr. Robert, but senior C.I.A. officials immediately realized that it had to be Edward Lee Howard, who had been fired in 1983 after being trained to become a ''deep cover'' officer in Moscow.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russian military officials promised today to investigate a grave containing a number of bodies found near a Russian military base outside the Chechen capital, Grozny. But they made it clear that they believed that its inhabitants had been killed by Chechen rebels and not by Russian soldiers.</p> <p>A rebel spokesman denied that, and contended that the grave contained the bodies of Chechen civilians who had been rounded up by Russian troops in local mopping-up operations, never to be seen again.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'finances']	<p>The international commodities trading firm run by Marc Rich, the billionaire pardoned by President Clinton, will be merged with Crown Resources, a Swiss-based energy trading concern owned by the Alfa Group of Russia, the two firms said today. The merger is expected to be completed within two months; financial terms were not disclosed.</p> <p>Mr. Rich had been a fugitive from federal charges of tax evasion, fraud and racketeering for more than 17 years before his pardon last month, which has sparked criminal and Congressional inquiries in the United States. Reports that Mr. Rich was interested in selling or merging his business have circulated since last year, when a bout of pneumonia kept him out of his office for two months.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>When a Central Intelligence Agency officer, Aldrich H. Ames, was arrested as a spy for Moscow in 1994, critics questioned how the agency could have allowed his espionage to go undetected for nine years. Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation helped fuel the criticism with complaints that the C.I.A. had failed to share sensitive information, stifling the investigation.</p> <p>Now the F.B.I. finds the shoe on the other foot, facing questions about how it allowed a senior bureau official to spy for Moscow for nearly twice as long as Mr. Ames had.</p>
['biographical information', 'bombs and explosives', 'computers and the internet', 'terrorism', 'espionage']	<p>A senior F.B.I. agent who worked as a counterintelligence supervisor at the agency's headquarters was charged today as a spy who passed highly classified information to Russia for 15 years without being detected. Law enforcement officials described the case as an extremely grave breach of national security.</p> <p>The agent, Robert Philip Hanssen, 56, was accused of turning over to Moscow a huge array of secrets, including the identities of three Russian agents who had been secretly recruited to spy for the United States. Two of the Russians were subsequently tried and executed; the third was imprisoned and later released.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin called on Europe and the NATO alliance today to work with Russia on developing a common defense against missile attacks and presented a set of proposals to the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, who is visiting Moscow.</p> <p>The proposals, calling for a mobile antimissile system that could be deployed rapidly and aimed in the direction of a threatening state, are another step in a diplomatic campaign to convince both Europe and the United States that the missile threat from so-called rogue states can be met through cooperative and limited defensive efforts.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'medicine and health', 'finances', 'taxation', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Following is a transcript of President Bush's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:</p> <p>MR. BUSH</p> <p>Good afternoon. It's been about a month now since I've taken office. And I thought it appropriate to come by and have a press conference.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'espionage', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>For nearly a dozen years, a former State Department official, Felix S. Bloch, has lived in limbo, dismissed from his senior diplomatic post and investigated on suspicion of being a Russian spy, yet never charged with any crime.</p> <p>While United States intelligence and law enforcement officials have long made it clear that they harbored strong suspicions that Mr. Bloch had committed espionage, the government never took its case to court. Former United States officials have complained that their 1989 inquiry was short-circuited -- and their ability to gather evidence limited -- because Mr. Bloch had somehow been warned that he was under scrutiny.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'crime and criminals', 'elections']	<p>The seven brothers of the Geci family were always at the forefront of the war against Serbia, and their home lies in the hilly central heartland of the Kosovo Albanians' fight for independence. Last weekend, they took a courageous step of a different kind, gathering the people of their village to denounce the bomb attack that killed at least 11 Serbian civilians last Friday.</p> <p>There is a climate of fear in Kosovo: although most Albanians say they are tired of violence, and voted overwhelmingly for the more moderate of their political parties in last October's municipal elections, few will speak out, let alone act against the perpetrators of violence.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A little phrase from Rudolf Scharping, the German defense minister, recently caused American military commanders to shudder: ''As the European Union develops its security and defense policy and becomes an independent actor, we must determine our security policy with Russia, our biggest neighbor.''</p> <p>The specter of Europe -- and particularly its central power, Germany -- adopting a more independent stance from NATO and paying close heed to Russia is chilling for the United States, and hard to reconcile with the Atlantic alliance that has preserved Europe's stability and advanced American interests for more than a half-century.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>Far above the Arctic Circle in Russia's northernmost region, a group of Moscow entrepreneurs has just staged a takeover. The effort, however, was aimed not at a company but at the regional government.</p> <p>The group is led by Aleksandr Khloponin, a 35-year-old former banker who came here four years ago from Moscow to overhaul a giant metals company called Norilsk Nickel. He was sent by his politically connected boss, Vladimir Potanin, who had snapped up Norilsk, one of Russia's economic crown jewels, when the government was selling off state businesses.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia is using international trade in weapons and technology to improve relations with China, India and Iran while trying to revive its status as a great power and challenge United States influence, the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, said today.</p> <p>In blunt testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Tenet indicated that the United States intelligence community was increasingly concerned by the direction of Moscow's foreign policy under President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
['finances', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin won first-round passage today for a bill to finance and regulate political parties.</p> <p>As with almost everything Mr. Putin does, the debate in the Parliament today, where the measure passed by 280 votes to 109, centered on whether the president was really trying to expand democratic pluralism or restrict it.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Marie Vikova, huddling with her daughter and her dog against a biting wind under the massive plinth where one of the world's largest statues of Stalin used to stand, pondered the city's latest idea for what to do with this echoing, haunted place: an aquarium, for tourists.</p> <p>''Well, one shark for another,'' Mrs. Vikova said. ''At least these can't hurt anyone.''</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'ethics']	<p>The Jehovah's Witnesses won a potentially far-reaching victory today in a Moscow court over prosecutors who had sought to ban the group under a 1997 law that prohibited religious sects that incite hatred or intolerance.</p> <p>Ending a lengthy trial, a city court judge threw out charges that the Witnesses had broken up families, tried to convert minors without their parents' consent and even pushed members toward suicide.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit', 'currency']	<p>Seeking to bolster a struggling ally, President Bush telephoned Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey today to offer his support for the country's efforts to cope with its second economic crisis in three months.</p> <p>Mr. Bush, in a five-minute conversation, expressed support for Turkey's economic overhaul and discussed the importance of continuing to work with the International Monetary Fund, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said.</p>
['energy and power', 'ethics', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A bitter wind grasping at his pants legs, Nikolai A. Yudin raised one arm outside the boiler room at the O.A.O. Razdolnoye Building Materials Factory, a red-brick husk aged well beyond its 42 years, and pointed emphatically at -- nothing.</p> <p>''There is supposed to be 6,000 tons of coal here,'' he said, staring contemptuously into a broad, shallow pit beside a rail spur, barren but for a thick coat of snow. ''We need 6,000. We got 123.''</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>''The Israeli nation needs unity,'' said Prime Minister-elect Ariel Sharon, continuing our phone conversation, ''to try to overcome all the hatred and the unbelievable splits. Arguments have always been part of political life here, but never as bad as this.</p> <p>''It's not only that the parties are splintered between each other,'' the last of the warrior-patriarchs went on, ''but now they are splintered from inside. The good thing is that I can talk to all of them.''</p>
['crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In what appears to be the longest and most substantive of his conversations with foreign leaders, President Bush initiated a 15-minute telephone call to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today. Mr. Putin raised the case of a former Kremlin aide now under arrest in New York on charges of money laundering, Russian officials said.</p> <p>White House officials said little about the telephone call -- less, in fact, than the Russians did -- and would not say whether the two men had talked about Mr. Bush's hopes of building a national missile defense. Mr. Putin has been leading an international campaign to persuade other nations to oppose the program.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Two days after American officials told their European counterparts that the United States intended to go ahead and develop a national missile shield -- but only after extensive consultations -- Russia responded today with a sober warning that it is ready to resort to a new arms race to ensure that its strategic rocket forces will not be undermined.</p> <p>At the same time, President Vladimir V. Putin was said to be preparing a diplomatic offensive to meet the leaders of two of the so-called rogue nations whose ballistic missiles are of greatest concern to Washington.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'currency']	<p>President Bush's treasury secretary described a new approach today for dealing with Japan as the world's largest and second-largest economies appear headed into decline, suggesting he would abandon Washington's constant stream of advice to the government in Tokyo and try working directly with Japanese executives he came to know while running Alcoa.</p> <p>In an interview this morning, the new secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, also said that he thought the Clinton administration's efforts to rescue the Russian economy when the ruble collapsed in 1998 were ''crazy,'' and he strongly suggested he would refrain from participating in multibillion-dollar economic bailouts aimed chiefly at stabilizing the currencies of countries where corruption and mismanagement led to crisis.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Reviving a practice hated, feared and ultimately banned in Soviet times, the domestic successor to the K.G.B. has served notice that it is again investigating anonymous accusations of crimes against Russian citizens.</p> <p>The K.G.B. heir, the Federal Security Service, published its decision nearly two weeks ago virtually as a footnote in the government's daily newspaper of record, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Not until this week did it attract the attention of human rights advocates and liberal politicians, who argue not just that the practice is a step back toward a Soviet-style police state, but that it is also illegal.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The offer last week from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to work with NATO on a mobile land-based missile defense system creates an important opportunity for the United States to engage Russia in a cooperative effort to develop a missile shield. In his meeting last weekend with Igor Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed to open a dialogue on this issue.</p> <p>A joint program of Russia and NATO to defend against possible missile attacks from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq would address Europe's two main worries about the Bush administration's commitment to building an antimissile system: that it could trigger a new cold war with Russia and that it would signify an American search for unilateral advantage.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Breaking openly with both the United States and his predecessor Boris N. Yeltsin, President Vladimir V. Putin formally agreed today to resume sales of conventional arms to Iran after a hiatus of more than five years.</p> <p>At a meeting in the Kremlin with President Muhammad Khatami of Iran, Mr. Putin also reiterated Russia's intention to help Iran complete a long-stalled nuclear power plant that some American experts contend could advance Iran's nuclear weapons program.</p>
['computers and the internet']	<p>''HAPPY 70TH BIRTHDAY PRESIDENT GORBACHEV!''</p> <p>The enthusiastic birthday greeting on the lushly designed new Web site (www.mikhailgorbachev.org) seems a little incongruous on the otherwise less-than-festive Web page, which includes glowing descriptions of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a former leader of the former Soviet Union.</p>
['books and literature', 'crime and criminals', 'biographical information']	<p>Many writers discover that the two sweetest words in any language are ''the end,'' but Ian Kershaw is happier than most to part with his longtime subject, Adolf Hitler.</p> <p>Publication of ''Hitler, 1936-1945: Nemesis'' (W. W. Norton), the second half of his biography, late last year, Mr. Kershaw said, spelled the end of a grueling cohabitation with a monster. ''It feels like I'm coming out of a long tunnel,'' he said.

['foreign aid', 'elections', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>With the conflict intensifying in Macedonia, the Bush administration and European allies made plain today that they had no interest in using NATO-led peacekeepers to fight Albanian insurgents and that the problem was one for Macedonia's government to resolve with diplomatic and monetary aid.</p> <p>The fighting around Macedonia's second-largest city, Tetovo, entered its fifth day today and has already sent hundreds of residents fleeing.  Macedonian troops are using heavy mortars to battle ethnic Albanian rebels in the hills above the city, and  reports said the government had called for the mobilization of reserves, a curfew and restrictions on civilian movements.</p>

['united states armament and defense', 'espionage', 'news and news media', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Vladimir Frolov, the press attaché in the Russian Embassy here, abruptly left for Moscow last week, his second tour of duty in the United States unexpectedly cut short.</p> <p>Mr. Frolov, who built a reputation among American journalists and experts at Washington policy organizations as a reliable and candid observer of United States-Russian relations, told reporters that he was returning home to join the Russian newspaper Izvestia.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia today accused two senior officials of the Bush administration of making ''openly confrontational'' statements by labeling Moscow as an ''active proliferator'' of dangerous weapons technologies.</p> <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry issued its strongly worded response to an interview published in Britain's Sunday Telegraph in which Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, used the most trenchant language to date among senior Bush aides to complain of Russia's role in providing ballistic missile technology to Iran and other nations.</p>

['medicine and health', 'biographical information']	<p>Russia's former president, Boris N.

['energy and power']	<p>South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, arrived here tonight for what could prove to be a clash with the Bush administration over the right strategy for dealing with North Korea as it emerges from self-imposed isolation for the first time in nearly 50 years.</p> <p>Mr. Kim, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for his efforts to end the armed standoff that has existed with the North since the end of the Korean War, has told his aides and some visiting Americans that he intends to sign a peace ''declaration'' with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, in the next few months. While that declaration would fall short of a peace treaty, Mr. Kim believes that it is essential to making irreversible the North's tentative moves to engage the outside world.</p>
['medicine and health', 'frauds and swindling', 'public opinion', 'biographical information', 'news and news media', 'computers and the internet', 'terrorism']	<p>Last year President Vladimir V. Putin flew in a jet fighter to Chechnya and sailed in a nuclear submarine in an Arctic sea. Tonight he entered cyberspace for the first time.</p> <p>Greeting a mostly young audience from around the world in a 40-minute live encounter on the Internet that was broadcast by the BBC, Mr. Putin defended Russia's policies in Chechnya, praised the achievements of the Soviet education system, and insisted that he was taking the country in the right direction toward greater democracy.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>An editorial this weekend in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a leading paper, had a brisk headline in English: ''Bully Bush.'' It reflected a growing allied concern over the direction of the Bush administration's foreign policy that the Europeans seem determined to resist.</p> <p>The editorial characterized the expulsions of about 50 Russian diplomats as ''extreme measures,'' criticized President Bush's handling of the Middle East, and fretted over his policy toward China and Taiwan. ''The strongest in the class should refrain from beating up his weaker classmates,'' the paper commented.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>American economic and security interests in the former Soviet Union are fundamentally linked. An economically stable Russia, integrated into the Western economy, would be far less likely to want to damage Western interests or dominate its neighbors, like Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova. Stable and prosperous neighbors would in turn support Russia's new generation of political and business leaders who seek success in the global market through domestic economic reform.</p> <p>How could we help build such improved relationships? There is one way the West could help Russia, and at the same time reduce Russian pressure on its neighbors: debt relief. Russia owes $48 billion of former Soviet debt to the Paris Club, the association of creditor nations that includes Germany and the United States. In recent weeks, Moscow has threatened to default on this year's payments and has demanded forgiveness or renegotiation.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>By the standards of authoritarian post-Soviet republics, it was a bit of an eye-opener: an illustration in a newspaper here depicted the prime minister, the energy minister, his deputy and the head of the state oil company all smiling as they carried a big length of oil pipe emblazoned with Chevron's logo across the Kazakh steppes.</p> <p>The theme of the illustration -- that Chevron has close, deep ties to the Kazakh leadership and wields immense influence -- would certainly not have come as a surprise. Chevron is a major oil producer here and has been one of Kazakhstan's most valued foreign investors since the early days of independence. The president of Chevron's Eurasia unit,  Guy Hollingsworth, says its relations with the government are ''excellent''; a top executive of Kazakhoil, the state oil company, was once a Chevron trainee.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Just three days after Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow became Pope John Paul II in 1978, the Central Intelligence Agency predicted that the installation of the first Polish pontiff would lead to political instability within Poland and the erosion of the Soviet Union's ability to control its Eastern European empire, according to newly declassified C.I.A. documents.</p> <p>In the analysis, in October 1978, the C.I.A. forecast that Moscow would find it increasingly difficult to ''check and to counter Poland's instinctive, cultural and political gravitation to the West.'' In fact, the Solidarity movement, a Polish workers' rebellion against Communist rule that was supported by the pope, began just two years later, and ultimately played a crucial role in ending Soviet control over Eastern Europe.</p>
['energy and power', 'law and legislation', 'gas (fuel)', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Bush administration, some influential Republicans in Congress and several big owners of coal-burning power plants have joined in advocating something long sought by environmental groups and Democrats: cuts in the plants' emissions of carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas widely thought to contribute to a global warming trend.</p> <p>The cuts would come as part of a larger bill controlling carbon dioxide and three other emissions from the power plants: sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain; nitrogen oxides, which contribute to smog; and mercury, a toxic heavy metal.</p>
['television', 'news and news media', 'terrorism', 'espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Indulging its own version of spy mania, Russia's intelligence services released television film on the main news channels tonight showing United States military attachés buying information from a Russian agent.</p> <p>The news programs also broadcast an audio tape of a Russian scholar, currently on trial for espionage, phoning Capt. Robert Brannon, a senior American naval attaché here, and discussing what kind of armaments were aboard a Russian intelligence ship sent to the Balkans during the NATO military campaign in 1999.</p>
['espionage', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In a retaliatory move, the Bush administration has ordered a number of Russian diplomats to leave the country in the wake of the arrest last month of an F.B.I. agent on charges that he spied for Moscow for more than 15 years, American officials said today.</p> <p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with the Russian ambassador, Yuri V. Ushakov, this afternoon and issued the order that the diplomats leave, the officials said, describing them as intelligence officers working undercover as diplomats.</p>
['terrorism', 'taxation', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>President Bush recalled the helicopter tour of the West Bank given him by Ariel Sharon three years ago. The Israeli prime minister, who knows every ridge and wadi of Judea and Samaria, smiled ruefully and said that such a low-flying tour was not possible these days because the chopper would be vulnerable to Palestinian fire.</p> <p>The way to suppress such guerrilla gunfire was clear in the White House visitor's mind: Begin negotiations only when Yasir Arafat realizes that violence no longer pays. When the Palestinian leader publicly and privately takes action to turn off terror,  Israel's economic retaliation will end, allowing an interim state of nonbelligerency to be negotiated.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>After paying his respects to the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia left for home today showing some satisfaction that he had re-established Russia as a player in Asia.</p> <p>With his visits to South Korea and to this citadel of solidarity with Russia's Soviet past, Mr. Putin settled important economic issues of Soviet-era debt, advanced Russian energy and transport projects that could reap significant benefits for Moscow over the next decade, and showed that he is able to play a constructive -- perhaps crucial -- role in defusing the region's most urgent security threat, the North Korean ballistic missile program.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Pay attention to the brouhaha at the White House Wednesday, when President Bush shot down the hopes of President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea that the Bush team would quickly resume negotiations with North Korea. This episode highlights the fine line between a tough, effective foreign policy and a tough, ineffective foreign policy, and it raises the question: On which side of that line does Mr. Bush plan to reside?</p> <p>On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin Powell, who represents the pragmatic, hard-nosed internationalists within the administration, declared that the Bush team intended  ''to pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off'' in negotiations with North Korea to curb its production and sale of ballistic missiles. But President Bush, after meeting President Kim Wednesday, brusquely indicated that the missile talks with the North would not be resumed any time soon.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism']	<p>For half a decade, Russia has conducted what it says are nonnuclear tests under the ground of an Arctic island, as the United States says it does beneath the Nevada desert.</p> <p>But the tests have caused bitter divisions among intelligence officials and nuclear analysts in Washington. Some have concluded that Russia is lying and is instead detonating small nuclear blasts; other experts say that charge is reckless and probably wrong.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>The United States government constructed a secret tunnel under the Soviet Union's embassy in Washington to eavesdrop, but federal investigators now believe the operation was betrayed by the F.B.I. agent who was arrested last month on charges of spying for Moscow, current and former United States intelligence and law enforcement officials say.</p> <p>The secret tunnel operation, which officials indicated was run jointly by the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, was part of a broad United States effort to eavesdrop on and track Soviet -- later Russian -- facilities and personnel operating in the United States.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Newspaper readers and television viewers over the past few days might have been forgiven for thinking they were caught in a time warp, a throwback to the bad old days of Dr. Strangelove and superpower  conflict. The expulsion of 50 Russian diplomats from the United States and Russia's quick retaliation in kind feel  like something out of the cold war. But despite all the rhetoric, these actions, at least for the intelligence agencies on both sides, do not signal a return to the cold war. For them, it never ended.</p> <p>Nothing on the grand scale of the current expulsions has been seen since 1986, when a round of retaliations began in August with the espionage arrest in New York of a Soviet intelligence agent employed at the United Nations. A week later, Nicholas Daniloff, an American correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was arrested in Moscow. Over the next two months of tit for tat, 25 Soviet diplomats were expelled from the United States, Moscow ejected five Americans, and then Washington banished 55 more Soviets.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'espionage']	<p>Russia's ambassador to the United States, Yuri V. Ushakov, was host at  an elegant soiree for some of Washington's most prominent people recently, just as the latest spy scandal between the two countries was exploding. ''I felt sorry for him,'' said Robert S. Strauss, who was the guest of honor at the party at Mr. Ushakov's residence.</p> <p>Despite the caviar, the suckling pigs and the Stoli vodka to help the guests wash it all down, it was a slightly awkward affair. Mr. Strauss, who knew what everybody was gossiping about, brought up the matter of the once-secret American tunnel under the Russian Embassy that was suddenly all over the news.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Before visiting Washington early this month for his first meeting with President Bush, the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, was bubbling with ideas about how to sustain the momentum in his quest to reconcile his nation with its long-hostile neighbor, North Korea.</p> <p>There was talk of signing a joint peace declaration with the North, formally ending hostilities decades after the end of their civil war. South Korea was considering supplying electricity to its energy-poor neighbor. And there were expectations of a return visit to Seoul this spring by the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, following up on a summit meeting last June in Pyongyang.</p>
['espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The wood-paneled auditorium, filled with more than 175 gray-haired men in gray suits, was buzzing. The men, mostly retired C.I.A. analysts and some current ones, were not known for their garrulousness, but many couldn't contain themselves. ''This is all too much,'' said an otherwise sober-minded analyst. ''I'm sorry. I just -- I can't stop talking. This is great!''</p> <p>They had gathered at Princeton University last week along with 70-some professors, students and dabblers in espionage for a two-day conference devoted to the agency's analysis of the Soviet Union from 1947 to 1991.</p>

The project's directors, David A. Roozen and Carl S. Dudley, have estimated that the material they gathered represents the experience of 90 percent of the nation's religious worshipers.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Two competing foreign policy camps are emerging in the Bush administration -- an ideologically conservative Pentagon and a more moderate State Department -- which have already provided President Bush conflicting advice on central issues.</p> <p>At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is collecting a hard-line group of advisers who have supported arming the Iraqi opposition to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and who are deeply skeptical of the European effort to form a rapid deployment force alongside NATO.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'suits and litigation', 'taxation']	<p>For all the reminders of Bob Key's cold war effort, mining uranium for American nuclear weapons programs, none stands out more than the tank of oxygen tethered to his throat. Mr. Key, 61, has pulmonary fibrosis, a scarring of the lungs that is often fatal. A recent tracheotomy helps air flow to his lungs through a tube connected to the tank.</p> <p>A decade ago, Congress recognized the contributions of Mr. Key and other uranium miners and passed the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990. Signed by President George Bush, the law established one-time payments of up to $100,000 to miners or their families and to people who lived downwind from the nuclear test sites in Nevada. Last year, Congress increased the payout to $150,000, added new medical benefits and expanded the number of workers eligible.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>An American student who was investigated on suspicion of espionage and charged with possession of marijuana may instead face more serious drug charges, Russian police authorities indicated today.</p> <p>It was not clear whether the case of the student, John Edward Tobin, 24, was taking a more serious turn because of last week's decision by the Bush administration to expel 50 Russian diplomats for what Washington calls espionage activity.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>China's top arms-control negotiator, reiterating the country's opposition to American development of a national missile-defense system or a smaller ''theater'' system in Asia, said today that China was willing to discuss the proposed antimissile shields with the United States in order to ''narrow our differences.''</p> <p>Sha Zukang, director of China's Arms Control and Disarmament Department, called the national missile-defense plan an American attempt ''to seek its own absolute security'' at the expense of other countries. He also said the presence in Asia of a smaller shield would hurt stability in the region.</p>
['espionage']	<p>The Bush administration took a muted public approach today to Russia's decision to resume sales of conventional arms to Iran, using the arrival of Moscow's senior national security official to express concerns that fell short of sharp criticism.</p> <p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that the United States had to be ''candid with the Russians'' in telling them that they should not be ''investing in weapons sales in countries such as Iran which have no future.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'elections']	<p>Wendy R. Sherman brought along an extra suitcase of cold-weather gear even when she joined Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright for a December trip through Africa.</p> <p>As the Clinton administration's senior policy coordinator on North Korea, Ms. Sherman was prepared to fly to Pyongyang on a moment's notice. Her task there would be to clear away the final barriers to an accord that would neutralize the North Korean missile threat, which has been a central justification for the hotly debated American national missile defense project. Had she succeeded, the framework of an agreement would have been signed by  President Clinton and Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, in Pyongyang, the North's capital.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'espionage', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The Federal Security Service said today that it had no further interest in an American student arrested on drug charges this month, who it said on Tuesday was training to become an American military spy.</p> <p>But other officials indicated that they might charge the American with more serious violations of narcotics law that could lead to a lengthy prison sentence.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>As the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, flew off to Vietnam today, South Koreans were left wondering why their government, one of America's staunchest allies in the region, had tilted toward Russia on a crucial issue of international security during his visit here this week. The answer, officials here said, seems to be the fear of another crisis over North Korea's ballistic missile program and Russia's increasingly important role in trying to persuade North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, to give it up.</p> <p>Suddenly, the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, needs Mr. Putin. And time is running out as domestic frustration with the North-South peace initiative is rising in South Korea while, in Washington, the Bush administration is already showing signs of impatience and a hardening of tone over North Korea's lack of movement.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>When President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced his interest in joining the United States and Europe in a missile-defense program, it appeared that old adversaries might be coming together. But one significant adversary, China, would be left out. China is terrified of a missile-defense system that would make its own nuclear force impotent. The inclusion of Russia, at least from China's point of view, would only further endanger global security.</p> <p>Russia has not really been the problem since the Reagan administration. Indeed, President George H. W. Bush briefly pursued a joint Russian-American anti-ballistic missile system. It had been proposed by Boris Yeltsin in response to Mr. Bush's advocacy of missile defense -- a situation rather similar to that today. Then as now, none of the American missile defense systems being considered could reduce the deterrent of Russia's several thousand warheads. The only major power threatened by the new round of missile defense proposals is China. And the chief effect of Russia's offer of cooperation would be to radically destabilize global security dynamics by backing China into a corner.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'finances']	<p>President Bush and Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, met today to discuss joint strategies for restoring growth to the world's two largest economies but ended the session with only a vague commitment by Japan to confront its problems.</p> <p>''The interrelationship between our two economies is important,'' Mr. Bush said at a brief photo opportunity with Mr. Mori, noting that the two countries account for roughly 40 percent of the world economy. ''The stronger we are, the more likely it is there will be prosperity in other parts of the world.''</p>

['russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Bush administration has not articulated a broad policy toward Russia, but in thoughts and deeds it has taken a sharp departure from the engagement policies of its predecessor, moving toward isolating Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>In its first two months, despite a lack of crises before this week's tit-for-tat spy expulsions, the administration has shown apparent disdain for Russia by insisting that it will move ahead on missile defense regardless of Moscow's objections, by rebuffing the suggestion of a summit meeting and showing an inclination to downgrade the status of Russia as a world power.</p>
['terrorism', 'suits and litigation', 'espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia said today that it was expelling four United States diplomats for ''activities incompatible with their status,'' the diplomatic phrase for espionage, and added that it would take ''other measures to halt the unlawful activities'' of official American representatives, but did not elaborate.</p> <p>In a formal statement read to John Ordway, the second-ranking American diplomat in Moscow, a Foreign Ministry official did not identify the diplomats to be expelled in the next few days and did not state that Russia would fully retaliate for the Bush administration's decision to expel a total of 50 Russian diplomats between now and July.</p>
['terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The European Union said today that it had pressed Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, to find a ''political solution'' in Chechnya, but Mr. Putin defended his handling of the situation, saying he saw parallels with the problems developing in Macedonia.</p> <p>At lunch with European leaders who are here for a two-day meeting, Mr. Putin played down a tit-for-tat espionage dispute with Washington, saying he doubted that it marked a serious breakdown in relations.</p>
['terrorism', 'energy and power', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin is deep in the Siberian taiga -- either skiing or hunting wolves, the Kremlin will not say for sure -- but here in the capital there is no vacation from the political debate that Russia's blossoming relationship with Iran has touched off.</p> <p>A state visit this week by the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, the first of its kind since the Iranian revolution, has not only set off alarms in the Bush administration over Moscow's determination to sell arms and nuclear technology to Tehran. It has also caused prominent Russians to question the prudence of developing warmer relations with a country believed to be supporting terrorism.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, today made his first visit to the capital of this old Soviet ally, which is fitfully trying to open its economy and catch up with the development boom in Asia.</p> <p>From the Russian perspective, Mr. Putin had a good first day here on a tour that started in South Korea, though his motorcades through the bicycle-clogged streets attracted far less interest than did President Clinton's in November, which turned out large, enthusiastic crowds.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The government made a swift retreat today from what had appeared to be a decision by President Kim Dae Jung to support President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in opposing the missile defense program backed by President George W. Bush.</p> <p>Pressed by United States officials for an explanation of Mr. Kim and Mr. Putin's joint statement on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry drew a careful distinction between endorsement of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and opposition to national missile defense.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'espionage', 'children and youth']	<p>So I came home the other night, and one of my daughters was doing her homework and asked me to remind her which were the good guys: the North Koreans or South Koreans? That triggered a dinner table discussion of the cold war and the Cuban missile crisis. I explained that I vividly remember listening to the radio during the Cuba crisis and that our school had regular drills where we had to hide in the basement during a simulated nuclear attack.</p> <p>Oh, my daughters said to me, we have those kinds of drills, too. When I asked them to explain, it quickly became apparent that the threat they were practicing for was not a nuclear attack, and not just a bad storm, but an attack by an armed student or intruder shooting up their public schools. We have ''code red'' and ''code blue,'' my daughters, ages 12 and 15, said. Code blue means all students must remain in their classroom or go immediately there. Code red means a total ''lockdown'' -- all students must remain in their classroom or rush to the nearest classroom. Teachers must lock their classroom doors, move students into the safest corner, keep them silent and cover the window of their classroom door with paper, so no gunman can see if students are inside.</p>
['frauds and swindling']	<p>After a week of resignation rumors and steady denials, Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori met with senior members of his party today to signal his intention to step down next month.</p> <p>Mr. Mori's decision involved no public statements, and could not be officially confirmed, although senior members of the Liberal Democratic Party were widely quoted in the Japanese press acknowledging that the resignation was in the works.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'russia-international relations-us', 'television', 'terrorism', 'espionage']	<p>The Russian government today denounced the expulsion of about 50 of its diplomats from the United States as a ''hostile'' act and vowed an ''adequate'' retaliation. ''You will not have to wait long,'' Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov warned in a statement to an American television network.</p> <p>Mr. Ivanov did not elaborate, but other Russian officials made clear that Americans would be expelled from Russia. ''We have time to think, to carefully pick from among more than 1,000 U.S. diplomats in Russia, to choose those 46 who are most precious to the Americans,'' Sergei B. Ivanov, the chief of Russia's Security Council, said on Polish state television during a visit to Warsaw.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'stocks and bonds', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'treaties', 'energy and power']	<p>President Bush met a barrage of criticism last week when he backed away from regulating carbon dioxide emissions, but he was only hastening the inevitable. A major shift in American policy on global warming had to come -- not chiefly because of the new administration's debts to campaign donors, but because of the sheer impracticality of the policy in place when George Bush took office. In the long run, Mr. Bush may actually have improved chances for slowing manmade changes in the world's climate.</p> <p>Until last week, global warming policy was synonymous with the Kyoto Protocol, which requires industrialized countries to control emissions of greenhouse gases according to strict targets and timetables. Environment ministers dominated the negotiations that led to the 1997 protocol, and they sought targets that were symbolically tough but hopelessly unrealistic.</p>
['espionage', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Retaliatory measures now under way between Washington and Moscow fit neatly into the long-established rules of the espionage game that the two sides have played by ever since their first spies went out into the cold to do silent battle.</p> <p>President Bush's decision to expel four Russian diplomats immediately, and demand that the Russians withdraw 46 more by July 1, is the largest such action since 1986 and far more aggressive than any similar move taken by the United States since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian officials, complaining that the Bush administration is trying to return to a cold war mentality, vowed to retaliate in kind.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'finances', 'banks and banking']	<p>THE transition from Communism to a free-market economy is like changing the engine on an airplane while it is still flying,'' Gerard Roland of the University of California at Berkeley explained at a conference here. The challenge is to feed, clothe and house people -- and maintain their support for reform -- while overhauling the system of production and distribution.</p> <p>The most striking lesson of transition has been that all the former Soviet bloc countries took a steep nose dive after gaining political and economic freedom around 1989; only now are the more successful ones surpassing the meager level of output they had at the twilight of Communism. Economists at the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education conference chalked up the slow progress primarily to underdevelopment and inadequate enforcement of commercial laws, and lack of encouragement of private start-up companies.</p>
['frauds and swindling']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin replaced his defense and interior ministers today and dismissed the country's atomic energy chief in the most extensive set of personnel changes in his year-old government.</p> <p>In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said ''the time has come'' to put in place a team that will execute plans debated for nearly two years to reconcile Russia's drastically reduced defense resources with its ambitions to be a more effective military power -- and salesman of nuclear energy.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>A little more than a decade ago, George W. Bush's father played a decisive role in uniting Germany. On Thursday, the president will come face to face with the consequences of that act as he meets a buoyant German chancellor carrying firm, sometimes confrontational, messages from Europe.</p> <p>Gone is the Germany that existed during the cold war, sovereign in name but rather less so in reality.  Gone is the Germany that knew its interests but seldom dared speak them aloud. In their place is a more confident, assertive nation whose new ambitions Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has come to embody.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The White House is starting a comprehensive review of all American aid programs to Russia set up to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, a senior administration official said yesterday.</p> <p>The broad review, initiated by National Security Council officials who have previously been critical of some of these programs, is likely to change significantly how Washington spends more than $760 million a year trying to dismantle former Soviet nuclear, biological and chemical complexes and prevent unconventional weapons and hazardous materials from being either sold to rogue states and terrorist groups or stolen by them.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'television']	<p>The BBC is calling. Israel's former prime minister is calling. A Moscow newspaper is calling.</p> <p>Then Natan Sharansky calls. And in the palatial glass-walled room overlooking his swimming pool, Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the Russian media magnate, breaks into a grin that stretches from one ear to the cordless telephone plastered against the other. ''From a big political prisoner to a small political prisoner!'' is how he greets Mr. Sharansky, among the best-known dissidents in the Soviet Union of the 1970's.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, decided today to turn the page from last month's tit-for-tat spy expulsions and agreed during a session in Paris that their leaders would have their first meeting by the end of July.</p> <p>At a news conference in Paris before General Powell flew to Macedonia for Balkan talks, he and Mr. Ivanov outlined several fronts on which they hoped to work together.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals', 'suits and litigation']	<p>When Pavel P. Borodin finally gave up his fight in a New York court and agreed to confront justice in Switzerland last weekend, he probably never thought that a three-year-long investigation against him could be over so quickly.</p> <p>But today, the case against the 54-year-old Russian all but collapsed after Swiss judges realized that without cooperation from Russia, there was little likelihood of proving that Mr. Borodin had pocketed millions of dollars in kickbacks from Swiss companies that renovated the Kremlin.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'freedom and human rights', 'accidents and safety', 'international trade and world market', 'finances', 'taxation', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>So what are the lessons from this latest China-U.S. crisis? They are: (1) When dealing with China, carry a big stick and a big dictionary. (2) This is an inherently unstable relationship. (3) Get used to it -- it's going to be this way for a long time.</p> <p>Let's start with Lesson 2, because it's the crux of the matter. We learn from this incident that the U.S.-China relationship has within it two highly stabilizing and two highly destabilizing elements, and the future will be shaped by the balance between them.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>China succeeded today in striking from the agenda of the United Nations Human Rights Commission an American resolution calling attention to Beijing's human rights record.</p> <p>The procedural maneuver, which effectively bars all debate on China at the annual six-week session of the commission in Geneva, was supported by Russia and major Asian, African and Arab nations.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'credit', 'television', 'news and news media', 'finances']	<p>Spain today rejected Russia's request to extradite Vladimir A. Gusinsky, ending the media baron's 10-month legal battle with the Russian authorities just as the prize pieces of his Russian empire were being seized.</p> <p>Spain's high court decided, 2 to 1, against handing over Mr. Gusinsky, who is charged with fraud in Russia, saying in a 30-page document that the charges are not a crime in Spain. Mr. Gusinsky will be free to travel within three days if the decision is not appealed. He has been confined by house arrest to his home since December.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Pentagon today produced a grainy videotape of a close encounter between a Chinese fighter jet and an American spy plane that it said underscored a pattern of aggressive and reckless flying by China's Air Force in recent months.</p> <p>The black and white videotape taken on Jan. 24 showed a Chinese F-8 -- based on its number, the same jet lost in a collision on April 1 with an American spy plane -- darting in front of another American EP-3E Aries II reconnaissance aircraft. ''We got thumped!'' an American is heard saying as the wash of the jet's engine rocked the aircraft.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>For more than 50 years, the EP-3E and similar spy planes have made tens of thousands of flights off the coasts of Russia, China and North Korea and in the Middle East, gathering intelligence.</p> <p>The EP-3E that was damaged in a collision with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1 is still in China, and as diplomats discuss its fate, the issue arises whether this facet of the spy game has outlived its usefulness.</p>
['airlines and airplanes']	<p>As Russia moves to consolidate its foundering aircraft industry, the Boeing Company and Russian government officials said today that they had agreed to study joint development of regional commercial jets to be built in Russia and sold here and abroad.</p> <p>Russia's aviation industry plunged deep into recession in the early 1990's when government orders for military and civil aircraft evaporated. The manufacturing sector is clogged with dozens of money-losing companies, while domestic commercial aviation, once dominated by a single state monolith, Aeroflot, has atomized into some 200 airlines. Many of those lines are small, cash-short regional operators with little ability to replace aging planes, many of them Soviet-era craft nearing the ends of their intended working lives.</p>
['television', 'public opinion', 'news and news media']	<p>Svetlana Ivanovna, a 57-year-old pensioner with a mind made up like a marine's bed, has a word for the liberal journalists who worked at Russia's independent television network NTV until its takeover this month: ''barbarians.''</p> <p>Two words, actually. The other is ''dishonest.''</p> <p>''I can't say anything good about them,'' she added, for clarity's sake.</p>
['suits and litigation', 'crime and criminals']	<p>A court in Voronezh, in southwest Russia, convicted a visiting American Fulbright scholar on drug charges today and sentenced him to 37 months in a penal colony.</p> <p>The verdict puts an official stamp on a seemingly minor marijuana infraction that swerved briefly and in bizarre fashion into suggestions of espionage. But it does not end the case, which now appears headed for an appeal.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'public opinion', 'international trade and world market', 'children and youth', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Zhou Jing's view of the United States as dangerous and domineering has hardened since American warplanes bombed China's embassy in Belgrade two years ago and an American spy plane more recently collided with a Chinese fighter jet off this country's southern coast.</p> <p>''The embassy bombing had a huge impact on me,'' said Mr. Zhou, 21, sitting in an American-style cafe across from Fudan University, where he is a student. Though he hopes to study in the United States someday and has no quibble with the American public, he said the bombing confirmed his view of the American government as unreasonable and arrogant.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'crime and criminals', 'suits and litigation', 'ethics']	<p>A Russian official detained in New York since January on Swiss charges of laundering millions of dollars in kickbacks from Swiss companies that renovated the Kremlin agreed yesterday to abandon his fight against extradition, saying he wanted to go to trial in Geneva and clear his name.</p> <p>The official, Pavel P. Borodin, 54, a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin and of former President Boris N. Yeltsin, was once director of the Kremlin's property department. He made his wishes known in a brief hearing before Magistrate Judge Viktor V. Pohorelsky in federal court in Brooklyn.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'espionage', 'accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The collision between a Chinese fighter and an United States Navy intelligence plane over the weekend was more than a random accident. It also reflected an increasingly dangerous rivalry between the Chinese and American militaries.</p> <p>After decades of keeping watch over its own skies, China's Air Force has begun in recent years to range farther out above the waters beyond its borders. The United States, in turn, has expanded its intelligence-gathering in the region, as Washington's security interests have increasingly turned eastward and away from the cold war theaters of Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'crime and criminals', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances', 'suits and litigation']	<p>Until last week, the long-planned privatization of Israel's phone company finally seemed on course.</p> <p>The preoccupations of state finance officials were typical of anyone managing the sale of a big telecommunications company: falling world stock prices, the shifting demands of the few serious potential investors, continual wrangling over regulatory issues and union contracts. But after years of preparation, bids were about to be submitted for a controlling 50 percent share of Bezeq, the $3 billion monopoly provider of domestic telephone service.</p>
['terrorism', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia is expected to lead a drive this month to persuade the Security Council to impose sanctions on Pakistan, the strongest supporter of Afghanistan's militant Islamic government, the Taliban, diplomats and United Nations officials say.</p> <p>The Russian campaign, coming after two rounds of United Nations sanctions against the Taliban, has the potential to place the Bush administration in a quandary.</p>
['treaties', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals']	<p>You will be relieved to learn that France's copy of the Treaty of Fontainebleau -- signed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1814 but which mysteriously vanished from the French national archives in 1988 -- has been safely in F.B.I. hands for five years.</p> <p>That's how long it has taken Mary Jo Molasses, the dilatory U.S attorney in New York, to prosecute a couple who tried to sell the treaty through an auction house in 1995. In the document, Napoleon -- crushed by russia, Austria and Russia -- abdicated as emperor before being exited to Elba.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>After making major changes in his cabinet last week, President Vladimir V. Putin promised a governmentwide shake-up today aimed at making business work, reversing capital flight and sustaining economic growth.</p> <p>Officials have been hinting for weeks that Mr. Putin would use his state of the union address to lay the groundwork for a significant round of reform, most prominently to rebuild the Soviet-era court system, but also to overcome bureaucratic resistance to a system of open and profitable businesses.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'espionage', 'accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Across Europe, the standoff between the United States and China is being seen as a serious international crisis and a test of President Bush's young administration.</p> <p>Reports of the collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter plane were front page news just about everywhere and prompted dozens of editorials, most of them urging China to return the American aircraft and its 24-member crew.</p>
['finances', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>Yellow ribbons. Energy crisis. Economic yips. The president shrinking into a tiny little figure in political cartoons.</p> <p>We're not getting Bush II. We're getting Carter II. All we need is the Killer Rabbit. And that is not where you want to be at the beginning of your presidency.</p>
['treaties']	<p>The Bush administration turned down a European request today that it reconsider a decision seen as likely to doom the international treaty on global warming known as the Kyoto accord.</p> <p>In meetings with European Union emissaries, who had been dispatched to Washington on an emergency mission, administration officials restated a view that the 1997 treaty was ''unfair to the United States'' and that it was not worthy of American support.</p>
['foreign investments', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'television', 'finances', 'suits and litigation']	<p>Foes of the Russian press baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky breached the walls of his media empire at last today, staging a renegade stockholders' meeting at which they appeared to seize control of the prize asset, the nationwide NTV television network.</p> <p>The day's events touched off an extraordinary scene this evening on NTV, the only network not under effective state control, as its journalists and supporters mounted a marathon broadcast to protest what they call an ill-disguised takeover by interests of the Kremlin.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>Michael Naumann, a former member of the German cabinet, was dining recently with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder when a newspaper was placed on the table. Above the headline, ''When Dwarfs Grow,'' was a photograph of the chancellor. Seeing it, Mr. Schröder joked, ''I'm not that small, am I?''</p> <p>In fact, the dwarf in question was not the chancellor, who is of modest stature by his country's standards but far from that short. Rather it was his country, a nation long referred to in the postwar years as ''an economic giant but a political dwarf.'' Germany, under Mr. Schröder, is indeed assuming a new dimension.</p>
['credit', 'television', 'gas (fuel)', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'energy and power', 'taxation']	<p>The Media-Most journalism empire, which lost control of its flagship television network NTV on Friday, was staggered again today when dissident shareholders who have taken control of the company closed its daily Moscow newspaper, Sevodnya.</p> <p>As in the case of NTV, the shares that proved crucial to the decision are owned by the state-dominated natural gas monopoly Gazprom, which is in a bitter struggle with the tycoon Vladimir A. Gusinsky for control of Media-Most. Gazprom is a creditor to Media-Most.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>As President Bush nears a decision on which arms to provide to Taiwan, China is warning that a sale of advanced weapons would endanger relations that have already been strained by the spy-plane collision.</p> <p>''Arms sales to Taiwan are the biggest issue in our relations with the U.S.,'' Sha Zukang, the senior official in charge of arms control for the Foreign Ministry, said in an interview this week. ''If the United States does not behave well, it may destroy our relations.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Ukraine's political crisis mounted today as Parliament voted overwhelmingly to dismiss Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and his government, dealing a blow to the pro-reform movement that Mr. Yushchenko brought into office in December 1999.</p> <p>The vote of 263 to 59 marked the end of an uneasy alliance between the prime minister and President Leonid D. Kuchma, the former Soviet rocket factory manager who has governed the country as prime minister and then president since 1994.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'finances', 'treaties', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The international organization charged with verifying the 1997 treaty that bans chemical weapons is in debt and may be forced to cut inspections in half this year because the United States and other key parties to the treaty have not paid their way, arms control experts said Wednesday.</p> <p>Ron G. Manley, director of verification for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is charged with implementing the treaty and ridding the world of chemical weapons, said in an interview that the United States, Russia and other member states were largely responsible for the financial crunch by failing to pay their annual assessments on time and failing to reimburse the group for inspections and other activities.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'stocks and bonds', 'finances']	<p>Chipping away at the wall of secrecy surrounding the operations of offshore banks, Robert M.

F. Bloomfield, a lawyer and a Queen's Counsel in Montreal and formerly honorary counsel for the country of Liberia, were charged with conspiracy, criminal possession of forged instruments and falsifying business records.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>As the Bush administration continues to review its foreign policy and has turned its attention this week to a crisis with China, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is doing what he can to move into the areas where Washington appears to have disengaged, Russian officials say.</p> <p>The officials say that Mr. Putin is trying to strengthen Moscow's bonds with Europe, increase Russia's role as a mediator in regional conflicts and open new trade links with Asia.</p>

Well, I say the Chinese are right. We should apologize. But why stop with the plane incident? We should apologize for being the market for $40 billion a year of China's exports. We should apologize for the fact that U.S. companies are among the largest foreign investors in China and have been instrumental in China's economic takeoff. We should apologize for the fact that 54,000 Chinese students study in the U.S. every year, more than any other nationality. We should apologize for the fact that the U.S. has shown restraint in weapons sales to Taiwan. We should apologize for the fact that the U.S. paved the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Yes, we should apologize for all these things and promise to stop all of them immediately.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>A confidential review by United States naval officers has concluded that Taiwan needs a significant infusion of new weapons, including a sophisticated ship-borne radar system that China has put at the top of the list of arms it does not want Taiwan to have.</p> <p>The assessment was carried out by officers from the United States Pacific Fleet, who visited Taiwan to assess its naval requirements in light of China's military buildup.  While military factors are not the only consideration, the still secret review is an important element of the deliberations about whether to sell Taiwan the radar system, known as Aegis, and other naval weapons.</p>
['public opinion', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>European leaders frequently bristle about American behavior, but President Bush's abrupt decision this week to abandon a treaty on global warming has provoked even more than the usual level of anger and frustration.</p> <p>''Irresponsible,'' ''arrogant,'' even ''sabotage'' are just a few of the charges that Europeans have leveled at Mr. Bush since he announced his refusal to follow through on the treaty, the Kyoto Protocol. And European Union representatives will take their case in favor of the accord to Washington on Monday, though their arguments are not expected to prevail.</p>

['television', 'news and news media']	<p>Once the ruler of a media barony stretching from print to broadcast to Internet, Vladimir A.

But it is unclear whether Itogi, a joint venture with the American magazine Newsweek, will hew to the editorial policies that gave its staff relative journalistic freedom.</p>
['television', 'finances', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit']	<p>Talks between Gazprom, the big Russian gas company, and an investor group led by Ted Turner over a stake in NTV, Russia's only private television station, appear to be snagged.</p> <p>NTV, the crown jewel in the empire of Vladimir A.

['suits and litigation', 'finances']	<p>More than 85 years after the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey, one of America's biggest life insurance companies agreed yesterday to pay up to $10 million to heirs of the victims.</p> <p>In settling a federal class-action lawsuit brought in Los Angeles, the insurer, the New York Life Insurance Company, said it would also pay at least $3 million to Armenian charities, mainly church groups.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>As the first foreign policy crisis of the Bush administration moved toward a conclusion half a world away in China, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was immersed in the politics of the Balkans today, sitting down with his European and Russian colleagues to chart the future of the troubled region where American troops remain as peacekeepers.</p> <p>During the presidential campaign,  George W. Bush the candidate made clear that he would like to reduce the troop levels in the Balkans decisively and as soon as possible. But today General Powell said that his presence at a meeting devoted to the region was ''a sign of the commitments of the Bush administration to the Balkans.''</p>

Lumbering along at about 350 m.p.h., the plane that is now impounded by China was being buzzed, shadowed and harassed by a couple of Chinese F-8 fighter jets capable of nearly three times its speed.</p> <p>One of the Chinese jets positioned itself in front of the Aries (the name, stargazers know, is Latin for ''the  ram''). Is it possible that our pilot, with a crew of 23 aboard, deliberately surged ahead to ram the fighter? That makes no sense; even if the slow plane could catch the much faster one, such a maneuver would be suicidal.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'space', 'finances', 'space stations']	<p>The International Space Station should be able to fulfill many of its objectives despite a projected $4 billion cost overrun that would force the United States to scale back some of its planned contributions to the project, the NASA administrator, Daniel S.

['airlines and airplanes', 'accidents and safety', 'united states armament and defense', 'terrorism']	<p>Thirty-two miles off the coast of China, the crewmen of the Navy reconnaissance plane spotted Chinese fighters closing in and knew they were in trouble. As the pilot struggled with his controls, radio operators began sending coded messages back to base reporting a possible confrontation. Partway through the second message, the transmission stopped. Minutes later the aircraft crashed into the East China Sea, killing all 16 crewmen. The date was Aug. 23, 1956.</p> <p>''We seem to be conducting something that we cannot control very well,'' President Dwight D. Eisenhower told Admiral Arthur M.

['television']	<p>The only American weekly news magazine in a significant partnership with a Russian media company has lost its weekly voice, Itogi.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, Newsweek magazine executives became alarmed after hearing reports from Moscow that, in a strategy originating from the state-run monopoly Gazprom, dissident shareholders had seized control of Itogi from Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the onetime media mogul of Russia, and fired the entire staff.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush and his new foreign policy team have announced that they plan to undertake a full review of all aspects of American policy toward Russia on matters like economic assistance, NATO expansion and missile defense. There must be a new agenda, we are told, because the old approach of cooperation and engagement pursued by the Clinton administration has been ineffective. In hinting at the tone of their new policy, Bush administration officials have promised a realist approach, which would presumably include greater attention to Russia's international conduct and less to reforms within Russia.</p> <p>Reviews are necessary and rethinking of policies prudent. But why, before the review is completed, has the administration already announced plans to cut cooperative nonproliferation programs between the United States and Russia? Perhaps, after a thorough reassessment, the Bush team could make the case that the cooperative programs that we now sponsor in Russia and other former Soviet republics do not serve American national security interests. Until such a case can be made, however, the proposal to cut these programs by $100 million, or more than 10 percent, from current financing levels is bad policy and worse as symbolism. True realism on the part of the Bush foreign policy team would mean increasing, not decreasing, the size of these efforts.</p>

Putin had made little progress on plans to exchange part of Russia's Soviet-era debt for German investment in the Russian economy.</p> <p>But on the final day of a meeting intended to bind Russian interests more closely to Europe, Mr. Schröder said he is willing to play a leading role in arguing Russia's case to Western creditors concerning its foreign debt. Russia is seeking a restructuring by 2003, when annual payments will surge from $14 billion to about $19 billion.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>An American diplomat is meeting skeptical Chinese officials today in an effort to convince them that President Bush's plans to build a missile defense will not undermine China's power and security.</p> <p>The diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly, said he was here to begin a ''dialogue with China on security and stability that reflects today's world.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'space', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'reform and reorganization', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As the Bush administration tries in the coming months to convince a wary world that it has nothing to fear from American plans to develop a national missile shield, the first priority should be to ensure that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld does not bring any more damage to the cause. At the very moment President Bush's emissaries were fanning out across the globe to explain his goal of defending America from missiles launched by so-called rogue states, Mr. Rumsfeld chose to announce a major reorganization of the Pentagon's space programs, including assigning responsibility to the Air Force ''to organize, train, and equip for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive space operations.''</p> <p>While Mr. Rumsfeld claimed that these reforms had nothing to do with any intention to deploy antisatellite systems or weapons in space, such protestations were cold comfort to the very countries that the United States seeks to assuage about its missile defense program, notably Russia and China. Unfortunately, both nations now have even more reason to be concerned.</p>

The American contingent in Bosnia, which is already in the process of being cut to 3,600 troops, would be reduced to 3,100.</p>
['energy and power', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Russia said today that it would begin a sweeping overhaul of its electricity industry, one of President Vladimir V. Putin's first major reform efforts, despite critics who warn that the changes would hurt foreign investors.</p> <p>The program, which would gradually create a market for electric power, was given tentative approval in a government meeting today, and would be official within a month. The electricity sector, comprising dozens of companies, would be divided into generation, distribution and sales units. The government would sell stakes in them, but would retain full control over the grid itself, and thousands of miles of power lines.</p>

['budgets and budgeting', 'taxation', 'finances']	<p>President Bush is not responsible for America's energy crisis, its current economic slowdown or even for all the tension between the U.S. and China and the U.S. and certain allies. What he is responsible for, though, is managing these situations. And that is what's worrying.</p> <p>It's not worrying because the Bush folks are incompetent. They are not, as they showed in deftly managing the spy-plane crisis. What is worrying are the combination of three factors that could produce a perfect political storm:</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>A quarter of a century ago, a new secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, faced a towering challenge: convincing a skeptical Congress that the post-Vietnam military needed a major infusion of money to meet the still-fearsome Soviet threat. Mr. Rumsfeld prevailed, winning the largest increase in military spending in a decade.</p> <p>Twenty-five years later, the Soviet Union has collapsed and America stands unrivaled as a military power. But Mr. Rumsfeld, now 68, is back at the Pentagon's helm. And once again he is arguing before a wary Congress that the armed forces need an expensive face-lift to counter emerging threats like terrorists with biological weapons and potentially hostile nations with long-range ballistic missiles.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'taxation']	<p>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a skeptic of President Bush's plan for a missile defense system, said today that he would seek to broaden the debate over the strategy when he takes over next week as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p> <p>Mr. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, said the decision on building a missile shield was the most significant national security issue that confronts American policy makers. Aides said the issue was central to the senator's decision to accept the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee instead of heading the judiciary panel when control of the Senate shifts to the Democrats.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>It is not surprising that the Bush administration's new effort to persuade Russia to scrap the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty has received a chilly reception in Moscow. It fails to address Russia's central concern, to ensure there are strict limits -- or at least clearly defined ones -- on the development and deployment of antimissile systems.</p> <p>That way Russia can ensure that an American missile shield can never become effective enough to neutralize Moscow's nuclear deterrent and that there are some constraints on how much the United States can exploit its technological and economic advantages.</p>

['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush sketched out his vision of a brave new world today in which the United States is protected by a multifaceted antimissile shield, nuclear arsenals are slashed and Washington and Moscow work together.</p> <p>What he did not explain was how to get there. The goal of Mr. Bush's long-awaited address was to make a persuasive case for his missile-defense plan and to set the stage for high-level consultations with the United States' allies, which will get under way next week.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Following is an excerpt from a speech by President Bush yesterday at the National Defense University in Washington regarding his international military policy, as recorded by The New York Times:</p> <p>. . . This afternoon I want us to think back some 30 years, to a far different time in a far different world. The United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a hostile rivalry. The Soviet Union was our unquestioned enemy, a highly armed threat to freedom and democracy. Far more than that wall in Berlin divided us.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush said yesterday that ''we must move beyond the constraints of the 30-year-old ABM treaty'' and establish defenses against nuclear missiles. His proposals deserve close analysis, especially with respect to their likely effectiveness and costs. They should also be subject to public debate, of which there has been stunningly little to date.</p> <p>The defensive technologies that will now be more intensively researched would be deployed in all environments -- land, sea and space. It is not clear that any, all or even parts of them will be effective. Estimates of what would be invested in this system have been wildly imprecise, varying between $60 billion and $100 billion or more.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush's pledge today that he will consult with allies as he moves forward with missile defense did not quiet many detractors. They said they feared that the president had already made up his mind to scrap the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, alter the global strategic balance and develop costly and unproven military technology.</p> <p>Backers of the missile system among Congressional Republicans were, as expected, buoyed today by Mr. Bush's words. And judging from the Kremlin's upbeat reaction to Mr. Bush's telephone call today with  President Vladimir V. Putin, he found a number of positive points in Mr. Bush's presentation -- especially the American pledge to engage Moscow in a new strategic dialogue that might lead to Russia rebuilding  its own missile systems. Mr. Putin has been assiduously promoting that idea in Europe.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'law and legislation']	<p>Newly installed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has restarted debate over altering Japan's constitution. The relationship between Japan's political elites and their 1946 constitution has long been vexed. The question now is why constitutional debate has resurfaced and what it may portend for Japan and the world outside.</p> <p>For years, Japanese conservatives have claimed that the ''MacArthur'' constitution of 1946 not only demeans Japan's armed forces, but also hampers the nation's ability to fulfill its United Nations obligations. Article 9 of the constitution forever renounces war as a right of the state ''and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The Kremlin said today that its opposition to scrapping the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty would not be changed by a United States proposal that would reportedly incorporate Russian missiles and radar in a new antimissile system.</p> <p>But as in the past, Russia did not rule out further negotiations over the American missile proposal, saying officials still await ''a concrete understanding'' of how and why Washington plans to supplant the ABM treaty.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Germany, unconvinced by President Bush's proposals for a missile defense system, today posed what an American envoy, Paul Wolfowitz, called ''very, very serious questions'' about the project.</p> <p>After meeting with German officials, Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, said the questions centered on whether such a system could be built ''in a way that is cooperative, rather than confrontational, in a way that enhances stability rather than generating new tensions and new arms races.'' Like other allies, Germany has been troubled by the Bush administration's determination to move ahead with what is seen in Berlin as an unproven and potentially destabilizing system of deterrence that would involve the scrapping, or at least the adjustment, of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.</p>

Nazarbayev urged President Bush to work with Russia and other states that have nuclear weapons to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals rather than proceed with plans to build the missile defense shield and to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>President Bush's decision to build missile defenses and eventually break with a central treaty of the cold war was the first outward sign of a far-reaching debate over whether the United States should simply abandon the business of negotiating strategic arms treaties.</p> <p>So far, the debate is percolating at senior levels of the administration and among experts outside the government.</p>

Armitage, called for even stronger bonds.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Responding to President Bush's call to deploy missile defenses, Russia said today that it was eager to begin the new strategic dialogue that Mr. Bush suggested to devise a common approach to new missile threats and to reduce nuclear arsenals even further.</p> <p>But a senior official made clear that Moscow expected that Washington would not take ''unilateral steps'' to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 without first replacing it with a new understanding.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'elections', 'finances', 'terrorism']	<p>In 1969 the U.S. decided to build a missile defense that would shoot down incoming Soviet nuclear missiles. Nixon speechwriters huddled and came up with a name to inspire confidence: ''the Safeguard system.''</p> <p>Unfortunately, Safeguard was also the name of a deodorant soap just gaining popularity. Despite derision from accommodationists who sniffed at Nixon's plan for its hard-line smell, development began of ''a bullet to hit a bullet.'' But when it became apparent that hundreds of Soviet missiles attacking at once (like a shotgun blast) could overwhelm an antimissile defense, Safeguard was shelved.</p>

['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'credit', 'finances', 'treaties']	<p>American officials said today that President Bush would probably meet Russia's president, Vladimir N. Putin, during a trip to Europe in June. The session will present their first opportunity to discuss several points of friction between Washington and Moscow, including the administration's missile defense plans, the future of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and Mr. Bush's oft-stated reluctance to provide additional financial aid to Russia.</p> <p>The encounter is expected to come toward the end of a trip during which Mr. Bush will meet with the leaders of NATO nations and visit Spain, Poland, Sweden and Belgium. A month later, Mr. Bush will meet Mr. Putin again, at the annual meeting of the leaders of the world's major industrial nations in Genoa, Italy.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>Leaders of the Atlantic alliance clashed today over President Bush's challenge to three decades of conventional wisdom about European security, with the heads of France and Germany contradicting Mr. Bush's declaration that there was a ''new receptivity'' to his plan for a missile defense shield.</p> <p>Although Mr. Bush said he had made ''good progress here in Europe'' on the plan, the reactions of those two key allies showed he is still confronting profound apprehensions about abandoning the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty between Washington and Moscow.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'espionage']	<p>It is not an easy thing to quantify, much less to prove. But among intellectuals and  advocates of a democratic Russia in the Western mode, a gnawing concern is arising that the relative freedom from state surveillance and restriction that citizens have relished in the last decade may be drawing to a close.</p> <p>Supplanting it is a resurgent government obsession with internal security and threats from abroad -- a phenomenon that they say has set off a limited but growing crackdown on supposed challenges to the state.</p>

['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>At his press conference in Moscow after he met with President Bush in Slovenia, President Vladimir Putin of Russia indicated his interest in a compromise on amending the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow an American missile defense. But he also indicated, forcefully, that this must be a genuine compromise, taking Russian concerns into account, or Russia would retaliate with a major expansion of its nuclear arsenal. This tough stance was inevitable. From the Russian point of view, it is an effort at balance.</p> <p>The American plans carry an obvious long-term threat to Russia's own nuclear deterrent; from the viewpoint of Russian security, adding warheads to counter an American missile shield would be a logical course. More immediately, the plans put Russia in a complex situation -- especially, as President Putin hinted, with regard to China.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin said today that if the United States proceeded on its own to construct a missile defense shield over its territory and that of its allies, Russia would eventually upgrade its strategic nuclear arsenal with multiple warheads -- reversing an achievement of arms control in recent decades -- to ensure that it would be able to overwhelm such a shield.</p> <p>Mr. Putin made his comments in a meeting with American correspondents that lasted nearly three hours tonight and was organized last week to give him an opportunity to explain his views after his summit meeting with President Bush in Slovenia on Saturday.</p>

Our countries have common interests and we share great responsibilities.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign investments', 'foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'credit', 'finances']	<p>IN Russia, a country where governments and economic programs used to change with the seasons, the economy for a third consecutive year is consistently -- and curiously -- stable.</p> <p>The government's budget has been in surplus for two years now. Russia has sworn off assistance from the International Monetary Fund, and in February the government began paying all of its foreign debts in full for the first time in post-Soviet history. The economy expanded 8.3 percent last year.</p> <p>But Russia has only begun to crawl back from a decade of economic decline during which its economy shrank by half. The revival stems in large part from a ruble devaluation of two-thirds in 1998 and two years of high world prices for oil and natural gas, Russia's main exports. The economic rebound, however, has made Russian industry more attractive to investors, particularly to people like Oleg Deripaska and others who made fortunes from Russian natural resources like aluminum and oil.</p> <p>Economists, though, are beginning to ask how long Russia's recovery will continue. In recent months, statistics have suggested that Russia's economic growth is slowing. Industrial production in April was 3.6 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs; that is down from a 9 percent growth pace early in 2000.</p> <p>At the same time, inflation has begun biting into the competitiveness of industry, and the country remains perilously dependent on commodities. Three raw materials -- oil, gas and metals -- account for 75 percent of Russia's export earnings. Economic reforms, to encourage banks to finance new businesses, for example, and open utilities to competition, are proceeding, but slowly.</p> <p>''There's still a long way to go before we can be fully confident about sustainable growth,'' said Christopher Granville, a strategist at United Financial Group, an investment bank based in Moscow.</p> <p>Probably the biggest challenge for President Vladimir V. Putin in the next several years will be to strengthen the rule of law in Russia, economists and business owners said. Economic reforms under his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, focused on dismantling the Soviet system, not on building institutions needed for a market economy. The ensuing chaos let down almost all barriers to theft and corruption.</p> <p>Russia's legal system has suffered. Executives in corporate battles often bribe prosecutors and judges, who earn an average of about $200 a month, to open baseless criminal investigations of their competitors or to let them snatch companies from their legitimate owners through forced bankruptcies.</p> <p>Economists say that without protection of property rights -- from state officials and business rivals -- Russians will not begin bringing back the billions of dollars that they have saved abroad, and foreign investors will stay far away.</p> <p>As a first step toward fixing this problem, the Kremlin last month submitted to Parliament a plan to reorganize the court system by making it independent of local elected officials and by stripping judges of their immunity from prosecution. The plan would quadruple judges' salaries over several years.</p> <p>Businesses have also applauded changes to the tax system that streamline and lower rates.</p> <p>In other areas, however, the government has been slower to make changes. Some initiatives, like a plan to reduce bureaucracy, have been watered down on the way to Parliament. Others, like overhauls of the banking system and natural monopolies, languish in government committees.</p> <p>Banks in Russia have yet to begin lending significant amounts to the the economic sectors where the money could be used best, some economists say. Cash-rich Russian entrepreneurs have started acting as their own investment bankers, circumventing banks.</p> <p>GOVERNMENT officials defend their record by saying the necessary reforms are so complex and far-reaching that they cannot be drafted hastily. Institutions, such as a strong legal system and an effective banking sector, took centuries to build in other countries, they say, while Russia emerged from Communism only 11 years ago.</p> <p>''These are major obstacles,'' said David J. Herman, head of General Motors in Russia and the former Soviet Union. ''What is the government doing to address these issues? The answer is 'something,' but it hasn't reached the point of success and breadth that makes you feel we are out of the woods.''</p> <p>While foreign scrutiny of Russia's economic progress has centered on the government's reform checklist, some economists say Russian companies are more powerful agents of change. In the current improved economic climate, businesses are beginning to make investments and undertake corporate reorganizations that, for better or for worse, are leading economic change in the country.</p> <p>''The most important thing is what you see on the private-sector side,'' said Peter Boone, head of research at Brunswick UBS Warburg, an investment bank in Moscow. ''Big oil companies and exporters are improving their own operations and buying up companies. That is what will drive change.''</p> <p>The seven biggest exporters that trade on the Russian stock market have combined annual revenue equal to that of the federal government, Mr. Boone estimated.</p> <p>''That's major financial power,'' he said.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russian President Vladimir V. Putin cautioned President Bush today about developing a missile defense shield without Moscow's consent, telling Mr. Bush that such an action could seriously strain relations between the two countries.</p> <p>But that warning was a surprisingly gentle one, tucked into a news conference here at which the two leaders' manners and words were striking for their warmth and relative ease.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Yelena and Yulia Nelimov, teenage sisters who came from Russia to live in Israel but died in the suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on Friday night, were buried side by side here today in a row of eight fresh graves.</p> <p>In a day-long procession of grief, one funeral after another was held for victims of the attack, which killed 19 young people, most of them Russian-speaking immigrants, in front of a discothéque. Sobbing friends and classmates moved from one funeral to the next, leaving behind piles of flowers and wreaths.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>The Russian defense minister said today that although his government agreed with Washington that the United States and Russia faced new military threats, it continued to view the Antiballistic Missile Treaty as the foundation for modern arms control and sees no reason to amend it, as American officials have urged.</p> <p>''Russia's position on the ABM treaty is unchanged,'' Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov told reporters after meetings with his NATO counterparts, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. ''So we would like to understand exactly what is intended to replace this existing system, for better or worse, to ensure strategic stability for the future.''</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Pentagon will ask Congress for permission to begin scrapping all 50 of its nuclear-tipped MX missiles as a possible first step toward a unilateral reduction in the nation's nuclear arsenal, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld announced today.</p> <p>The missiles with their multiple warheads and ability to decimate Russian missile silos, were a signature program of President Ronald Reagan, whose administration fought acrimonious battles with Congressional Democrats over the size of the program and the basing of the missile, which it called the Peacekeeper, in the 1980's.</p>
['international trade and world market']	<p>To the delight of epicures but the annoyance of ecologists, the United Nations agency that oversees trade in endangered species today rejected a ban on Caspian Sea caviar proposed by a scientific advisory body.</p> <p>But the agency, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, gave the countries bordering the Caspian, which accounts for about 80 percent of the caviar sold in Western Europe and the United States, until year-end to reach an agreement on the improved management of sturgeon resources and to conduct a survey of caviar stocks.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'finances', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Senate Democrats sharply questioned Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld today about the high cost and unproven effectiveness of a national missile defense system, and they raised deep concerns about the administration's threats to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile  Treaty if the Russians refused to amend it.</p> <p>During his first hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee since his confirmation, Mr. Rumsfeld met a surprisingly unified skepticism from liberal and centrist Democrats regarding missile defense, signaling the difficulties President Bush is likely to face when he tries to sell a plan to Congress later this year.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'stocks and bonds', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'books and literature', 'finances', 'computers and the internet']	<p>MARKETS have short memories, and the mourning of the latest boom-gone-bust is usually brief. In the nearly three years since Russia defaulted on its debt, investors have moved on -- first to the dot-com frenzy in the United States and then to its fizzle. Russia's derring-do tales of billions made and lost, of gun-toting tycoons and panic spreading across the globe have long since slipped from the headlines.</p> <p>Yet for much of the 1990's, the buzz surrounding emerging markets was intense, reflecting the fact that history was at a turning point: Russia was being sold off -- a former Communist superpower up for grabs in a way that would have once been inconceivable, especially considering that the country was a lumbering monster dripping with oil, diamonds, foreign money and, last but not least, nuclear weapons.</p>
['religion and churches', 'suits and litigation']	<p>Rancor mingled with relief as thousands of Nazi-era slave laborers began receiving payments yesterday from a $4.5 billion German compensation fund, more than half a century after the fact and following years of legal wrangling and delay.</p> <p>Dieter Kastrup, the German ambassador to the United Nations and the chairman of the foundation that is administering the fund, said that ''an important chapter has been closed.''</p>
['terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia and Yugoslavia said today that Kosovo was the main cause of instability in the Balkans and urged world leaders to ensure that Albanian ''terrorists'' in Kosovo and the region were completely disarmed.</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin, the first Russian president to visit Yugoslavia in over a decade, later warned that Macedonia could be a repeat of Kosovo, if Western pressure pushed the Macedonian leadership to give in to the demands of the rebels.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>''I like Old Joe,'' said F.D.R. about Joseph Stalin. Carrying on that self-deluding tradition of snap judgments, George W. Bush looked into the eyes of Vladimir Putin, announced, ''I was able to get a sense of his soul,'' and after two heady hours concluded he was ''straightforward'' and ''trustworthy.''</p> <p>Ever since the K.G.B. man emerged as the Russian oligarchs' choice, President Putin has shown himself to be duplicitous (ask the Chechens), anti-democratic (ask the remains of Russia's free press) and untrustworthy (ask the exiled oligarchs). We can hope that the Bush gush was flattery intended to show the U.S. president to be nonthreatening as his administration presses ahead with a missile defense.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>The warm rapport shown between President Bush and the Russian president, just one day after Mr. Bush declared that he wanted NATO to expand up to Russia's border, represented a significant achievement for the Americans, a senior official who helped plan the Bush trip said today.</p> <p>But critics on Capitol Hill said Mr. Bush was too willing to pronounce the Russian, Vladimir V. Putin, to be trustworthy after the two met on Saturday in Slovenia for the first time.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'biographical information', 'bombs and explosives', 'television', 'terrorism']	<p>Amnesty International called the execution of Timothy J. McVeigh a triumph of vengeance over justice. The Council of Europe called it ''sad, pathetic and wrong.'' The French daily Le Monde ran a front-page cartoon showing a stadium full of Americans watching it, all with glasses on for a better view.</p> <p>Across Europe, where capital punishment is outlawed in virtually every country, the objections to Mr. McVeigh's execution poured in fast and furious. The death penalty puts the United States at odds with its European allies, all of which have either abolished or suspended it.</p>
['terrorism', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>During his trip to Europe, President Bush is sure to face questions from Europeans about where Russian-American relations are going. Strategic issues presently dominate the way the American and Russian governments deal with each other. But over time this focus needs to, and is likely to, broaden.</p> <p>Certainly, President Bush has been criticized by some for seeming to ignore Russia during the first few months of the administration, and President Putin has made some American politicians edgy by warming up to countries whose interests are not entirely in line with our own. But relationships have a way of sorting themselves out, and United States-Russian relations are no exception.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The five major powers on the Security Council agreed today to postpone for 30 days a vote on a more generous trade policy for Iraq.</p> <p>The extension is intended to give experts time to evaluate a detailed list of items that the United States wants to prevent Saddam Hussein's government from buying unless it obtains international approval.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>BP's long-running dispute with the Tyumen Oil Company has taken an unexpected turn, throwing into doubt an agreement between Tyumen and another Russian oil company, Sidanko.</p> <p>BP P.L.C. bought 10 percent of Sidanko, from Vladimir O. Potanin, a businessman who was then a Kremlin insider, in 1997, when Russian markets were booming. After the ruble crisis a year later, Sidanko, ridden with debt, was pushed into bankruptcy. Its main production subsidiary, Chernogorneft, was snapped up by Tyumen Oil, now Russia's fourth-largest oil producer.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>In his first foray into the Balkans, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld heard today from American troops and commanders about the difficulties of stemming ethnic fighting along the Kosovo-Macedonia border, where some Bush administration officials want to curtail the United States' role.</p> <p>Traveling by Blackhawk helicopter in the shadow of Kosovo's snow-capped peaks, Mr. Rumsfeld surveyed the intricate networks of mountain trails used by Albanian rebels to smuggle weapons into Macedonia from Kosovo. He also talked to soldiers involved in gun battles along the border and was shown dozens of weapons seized from smugglers in recent weeks.</p>
['television']	<p>George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin have this in common: They got where they are by promising to be unlike their larger-than-life predecessors. Both say Russian-American relations will also be different, based on hard-boiled scrutiny of national interests, not on personal ties dressed up as grand strategy. So, when the un-Clinton meets the un-Yeltsin tomorrow, post-cold-war diplomacy officially enters its post-heroic phase. Visionary, big-guy bonhomie is out; small-bore practicality is in.</p> <p>This is more than just a change of style. Ever since the first President Bush embraced Russian-American ''partnership'' 10 years ago, American policy has been animated by one large goal: integration of Russia into the Western political and economic mainstream. This integration is still the right goal, and still very much in our national interest, but for both sides the concept has lost much of its practical, as well as its inspirational, meaning.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Seven illegal immigrants from North Korea sneaked past Chinese security guards today into the local office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, saying they would not leave until they had been granted political refugee status and guaranteed safe passage to South Korea.</p> <p>The incident forced the United Nations and China to confront head on a  problem they have mostly tried to avoid: what to do about the steady stream of North Koreans who have been slipping illegally across the border into China in recent years.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>CRUDE OIL FALLS. Crude oil fell after Russia said it would oppose tighter sanctions on Iraq, signaling Iraq may resume exports. In New York, crude oil for August delivery fell 27 cents, or 1 percent, to $26.98 a barrel.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>An American student serving a one-year sentence in Russia on a drug conviction faced fresh difficulties today, after a Russian scientist accused the American of trying to recruit him as a spy for the United States.</p> <p>The scientist, Dmitri Kouznetsov, a toxicologist who was imprisoned in the United Statese three years ago on bad check charges, accused John Edward Tobin, 24, a Fulbright scholar convicted in April for possession of marijuana, of being an F.B.I. agent. Mr. Kouznetsov said that while he was jailed in the United States in 1998, Mr. Tobin visited him, identified himself as an F.B.I. agent and offered leniency if Mr. Kouznetsov  would collaborate.</p>
['banks and banking', 'frauds and swindling', 'crime and criminals', 'finances']	<p>The major industrial nations warned Russia and two other countries today that they would face restrictions on their dealings with international banks if they did not make quick progress in clamping down on money laundering.</p> <p>A committee that includes the United States and 28 other countries said Russia, the Philippines and Nauru, the Pacific island nation, has done little in the last year to halt flows of illegally earned money through their financial systems. If the three countries do not enact legislation on the problem by Sept. 30, the panel said, they would be subject to sanctions, including tighter monitoring of international banking transactions or denial of permission for their banks to operate in other nations.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Can you imagine what the right-wing Wall Street Journal editorial page would have written had Bill Clinton, in his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, declared afterward, as President Bush did, that he had looked Mr. Putin in the eye, got a sense of his ''soul'' and found the former K.G.B. boss a ''remarkable leader,'' an ''honest, straightforward man . . . who loves his family''? Let's see, the lead editorial in The Journal would have been titled ''Soul Brother.'' There would have been one of those little drawings of Mr. Clinton over the caption ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' and the first line of the editorial would have read: ''For a guy who says he never inhaled, we can't help but wonder what exactly President Clinton was smoking when he met Vladimir Putin the other day. . . .''</p> <p>Ahhh, but that was then and this is now. Other than some searing criticism by Jesse Helms, Mr. Bush's loopy comments about the Russian leader were given a pass by the Republican right -- just George's boy getting a little carried away. In fact, Mr. Bush's words need to be taken seriously -- not for what they tell us about Mr. Putin and his soul, but for what they tell us about Mr. Bush and his foreign policy.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi formed Italy's 59th postwar government today, with a cabinet that balances his need to reward political allies with his desire to reassure European partners.</p> <p>With only days to go before a NATO summit meeting in Brussels, Mr. Berlusconi, a conservative 64-year-old media tycoon, selected Renato Ruggiero, 71, a respected technocrat and a former leader of the World Trade Organization, to be minister of foreign affairs.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'biographical information', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>IN his narrow office in the West Wing of the White House, Stephen J. Hadley keeps two small mementos. One is a cluster of models of every American intercontinental ballistic missile, from the Titan to the Peacekeeper, a reminder of his final days at the Defense Department in 1992, when he helped begin talks with Russia over sharing technology to build a missile defense system.</p> <p>''It was going fine,'' Mr. Hadley recalled recently, ''until the Russians figured out that George Herbert Walker Bush was not going to be re-elected.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>In his first five months in office, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ensconced himself in his Pentagon office to rethink defense policy in sphinx-like silence. But that changed last week during his first extended trip to Europe for the Bush administration.</p> <p>Over seven days, Mr. Rumsfeld held court in seven countries, offering detailed thoughts on military strategy, the problems with treaties and the need for America to project immense power to ''deter and dissuade'' its enemies.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell won support from France and China today for a plan to loosen restrictions on trade in civilian goods with Iraq, but he said that continued resistance from Russia made it unlikely that the proposal could be adopted at the United Nations by a deadline next week.</p> <p>Secretary Powell said Moscow had refused to ''engage'' on the issue and continued to insist that its commercial interests would be harmed.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>In early August, one of the world's largest and most advanced offshore platforms will slip beneath the two graceful suspension bridges spanning the Bosporus, with three feet of clearance, on its way to the Black Sea.</p> <p>If everything goes as planned, a month later the huge rig will begin laying a pipeline at record depths of 7,000 feet in corrosive mud on the bottom of the great kidney-shaped sea to bring natural gas from Russia to energy-hungry Turkey.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that the United States is likely to deploy certain antiballistic missile systems before testing on them is completed, signaling the speed with which the Bush administration hopes to develop and use the still-unproven technology.</p> <p>In a meeting of NATO defense ministers, Mr. Rumsfeld outlined a two-tiered approach in which the administration intends to continue consultations with its skeptical allies and Russia, even as the Pentagon moves as swiftly as possible to develop and deploy systems.</p>
['medicine and health']	<p>The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, appealed to American corporations today to dig into their pockets and give to a planned multibillion-dollar global fund to fight AIDS in Africa and other developing regions.</p> <p>Mr. Annan, who until now has focused on governments as major donors to the fund, has received pledges so far from only three nations, including the United States. Today, he tried to convince corporations that it was in their economic self-interest to contribute to the fund and to set up their own programs in the workplace to protect employees.</p>
['medicine and health']	<p>I  remember standing on a beach on an overcast day in 1985, feeling as if I knew a tragic accident was about to happen and no one could hear my warnings. Now the world knows about what I feared then -- the enormous size of the AIDS epidemic -- but to look ahead from here is to feel again that not enough people appreciate how a failure to act effectively would undermine the quality of life for everyone on the planet.</p> <p>In the 20 years ahead, AIDS can be brought under much better control in the United States -- if we don't let down our guard -- but it will be devastating in some other parts of the world.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Bush called today for an Atlantic Alliance that would stretch all the way to Russia's borders, delving more emphatically and aggressively than any of his predecessors into a matter guaranteed to make Moscow nervous.</p> <p>On the day before his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Bush used a speech in the capital of this former Soviet bloc country to urge a broad, steady expansion of NATO into the countries of Eastern Europe that are not now in the alliance. [Excerpt, Page A8.]</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Following is an excerpt from a speech by President Bush yesterday at the Warsaw University Library in Poland, as recorded by The New York Times:</p> <p>Today I have come to the center of Europe to speak of the future of Europe. Some still call this the East. But Warsaw is closer to Ireland than it is to the Urals. And it is time to put talk of East and West behind us.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Like many Poles, Wladyslaw Rancman spent some time in the United States. His favorite idiomatic expression, in entertainingly warped Chicagoese, appears to be ''by the way.'' As in: ''His father is more smart, by the way.''</p> <p>But his assessment of Bush the son was fond and forgiving, and that sums up the warmer reception that George W. Bush received today in Poland than elsewhere in Europe.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In the presidential election this month, Iranians voted overwhelmingly in favor of reform and democracy. The landslide victory of Mohammad Khatami, the candidate identified with reform, provides an opportunity for the United States to respond to the Iranian people's desire for change. The current stalemate in American-Iranian relations does not serve overall American interests. The United States should relax its economic sanctions against Iran and take other steps to foster an improved relationship, without weakening efforts to advance Middle East peace and prevent terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Our current policy is focused on important American security interests -- combating terrorism and containing nuclear weapons -- but largely neglects our geopolitical, energy and economic interests. The sanctions, driven by the desire to isolate and punish Iran, have scant international support and have made it more difficult to advance our interests in the region around Iran.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Following are excerpts from the Treaty on Good Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, as translated from the official Russian text by The New York Times:</p> <p>[II]</p> <p>The agreeing sides shall not use force or the threat of force in their relations, shall not use economic or other means of pressure against each other and shall resolve disputes between themselves exclusively by peaceful means according to provisions of the United Nations Charter, other generally recognized principles and the norms of international law.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'russia-international relations-us', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia and China signed a treaty of ''friendship and cooperation'' today, binding the two giants closer in the next 20 years and also committing them to oppose jointly much of the framework for international security that the United States is seeking to erect after the cold war.</p> <p>Composed of 25 articles, the treaty joins Russia and China formally in opposing the United States' missile plans and places Russia more firmly behind China's claim of sovereignty over the island of Taiwan. It also strengthens military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow while rejecting the intervention that NATO undertook in 1999 in the Balkans to stop the killing of civilians.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Bush administration played down the importance of a friendship pact between Moscow and Beijing today, saying it represented short-term interests rather than a long-term strategy that should concern the United States.</p> <p>''This was clearly designed to boost both of their international standing without adding much real substance,'' said Richard L. Armitage, a deputy secretary of state.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>The Pentagon is preparing to ask Congress for money to build a missile defense test site in Alaska that could also become the command center for a working antimissile system as early as 2004, military officials said.</p> <p>If it becomes operational, the site will be a clear violation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which allows some testing of antimissile technology but forbids deployment of a shield against long-range missiles in any state except North Dakota.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Bush administration, which has already pulled away from a range of international treaties, warned today that it would not join a pact to curtail the international flow of illegal small arms if it infringed on the American right to own guns.</p> <p>Speaking to the opening session of a conference on the trafficking of weapons that fuel increasingly brutal civil wars and expanding networks of organized crime, John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, invoked the Second Amendment.</p>
['treaties']	<p>President George W. Bush has been bold in his design for a Europe whole and free. Now he needs to be bolder still. On his first trip to Europe, last month, he made an impressive speech in Warsaw in which he argued that the European Union and NATO, those key institutions of Europe and the West, should grow decisively eastward. How far eastward, of course, remains the question.</p> <p>When Mr. Bush meets Vladimir Putin today, he should express clearly that his vision includes a future in which a democratic Russia is eventually embraced as part of NATO.</p> <p>In Warsaw, Mr. Bush stepped in that direction. He said the question of membership in NATO for eligible and willing democracies should no longer be ''whether'' but only ''when.''</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>Robert P. Hanssen, the former F.B.I. agent, pleaded guilty today to charges that he had spied for Moscow since 1985 and had handed over many of the nation's most sensitive secrets. The plea resolves a bizarre espionage case that shook the bureau and increased tensions between the United States and Russia.</p> <p>Appearing gaunt and wearing a green prison uniform, Mr. Hanssen stood before Judge Claude M. Hilton of Federal District Court here and calmly pleaded guilty to 15 counts of espionage, attempted espionage and conspiracy. Six other counts in the original 21-count indictment against Mr. Hanssen were dismissed as part of a plea agreement.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>Vladimir Putin yanked the rug out from under Democrats opposed to missile defense.</p> <p>It happened ''unexpectedly,'' as the Russian described it, when Presidents Putin and Bush agreed to work on a new strategic framework to alter or replace the old Antiballistic Missile Treaty, in tandem with lowering each nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons.</p>
['olympic games']	<p>I was deeply involved in the decision that President Jimmy Carter made to boycott the Olympics in Moscow in 1980. In 2001, were I on the Olympic Committee, I would have voted to award the Olympics to Beijing as the committee did yesterday, though with serious reservations.</p> <p>In 1980 we were very conscious of several critical considerations. The Soviet Union had just engaged in a direct military aggression against a weaker neighbor: Soviet tanks and paratroopers had invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, and the Soviet military was engaged in bloody massacres of the Afghans on a scale even larger than currently in Chechnya. In these circumstances we had to react in some fashion short of war. We decided on sanctions, and we felt that it would be unfair to our farmers and our industrial workers if our athletes were to act as if nothing atrocious had happened.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'news and news media', 'treaties']	<p>Russia stated officially today that it is confused.</p> <p>Confused, strategically speaking, on whether the Bush administration is planning to withdraw from, negotiate changes to, or simply ''bump up against'' the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Senior Pentagon officials announced details today of an ambitious missile-testing plan that they said could lead to a working system of land-based, sea-launched and airborne weapons in four years. Senate Democrats immediately attacked the proposal, saying it was highly likely to violate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty within a year.</p> <p>Democrats, responding to testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, accused the Bush administration of being intentionally vague about the new plan to lure Congress into financing work that might violate the ABM treaty next year. And they threatened to block any spending that seemed likely to breach that treaty.</p>
['children and youth']	<p>The State Department today criticized several of the United States' closest allies, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, Greece and South Korea, saying they had not made sufficient efforts to stop the trafficking of slaves within their borders.</p> <p>The assessments came in the department's first annual Trafficking in Persons Report, mandated under a law enacted last fall. It is similar to the reports on human rights and drug trafficking. Like those, it offers the option to apply sanctions, in this case to countries that are not, in the government's view, making adequate efforts to fight the slave trade.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Breaking ranks with most human rights groups and the American government, Human Rights Watch said in a report today that the Taliban alone were not responsible for a deepening disaster in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Human Rights Watch, a New York-based organization, called for sanctions against the armed opposition to the Taliban, and blamed Russia and Iran for giving the opposition front significant military support.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>As President Bush prepares for meetings this weekend with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other world leaders, the White House has stressed its desire to work out a new understanding with Moscow to replace the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.</p> <p>But the Bush administration has already decided that it will not accept a new agreement that limits the development of antimissile defenses.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, played a guessing game today over what each side intended on the sensitive issue of missile defense. Mr. Ivanov said that Russia would keep talking to the United States but conceded little else. Secretary Powell, who said the time had come to be more specific with the Russians, appeared at least in public to have few details to offer.</p> <p>In Moscow, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters he was open to the idea of negotiating an accord over a limited missile defense without discarding decades of arms control agreements with the United States.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'treaties']	<p>I understand how a position can be taken for the purpose of giving it up as a concession.</p> <p>That is why my friend George, whose mental reasoning is very deep, very profound (I must keep saying that), last year said he would unilaterally reduce the American nuclear stockpile.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>When the Bush administration took office it was skeptical of the Russians and openly dismissive of President Clinton's brand of personal diplomacy with Kremlin leaders.</p> <p>President Bush delayed meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin. Russian diplomats were expelled for spying. Top Pentagon officials charged that Russia was selling dangerous military technology to the Middle East.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia agreed today to link  discussions of American plans to deploy a missile defense system with the prospect of large cuts in both nuclear arsenals. If an accord was reached quickly, it might take the place of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's willingness to enter into simultaneous talks on both offensive and defensive weapons, which American officials said was a surprise, was greeted enthusiastically by Mr. Bush. He had proposed both the offensive and defensive changes during his presidential campaign.</p>
['treaties']	<p>I sure welcome the news that the Bush team will open missile talks with Russia, because it might bring some clarity to the Bushies' arguments on missile defense, which have been at best incoherent and at worst dishonest.</p> <p>Look at the Republican arms expert Richard Perle's Senate testimony last week. He was trying to justify why we need missile defense against rogue leaders, who, he claimed, cannot be deterred by the classic doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD), which has kept the peace for 50 years. ''[Some say] you can count on Saddam to be deterred by our deterrent,'' said Mr. Perle. ''I frankly don't want to count on the rational judgment of a man who used poison gas against his own people.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>President Jiang Zemin of China arrived in the Russian capital today for a state visit that is to culminate Monday in the signing of a treaty on friendship and cooperation. It will be the first such pact since 1950, when Moscow and Beijing allied themselves against the West.</p> <p>Russian and Chinese officials have said in recent weeks that the treaty -- and a political declaration that accompanies it -- do not represent a military alliance and that the accord is not aimed at ''any third country.'' Yet strengthening Russia's economic and political bonds with China will unavoidably be viewed as a response to the dominance of the United States and its European allies in post-cold-war international affairs, a number of political analysts said.</p>
['foreign aid', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A Bush administration review of American assistance to Russia has concluded that most of the programs aimed at helping Russia stop the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are vital to American security and should be continued, a senior administration official says. Some may even be expanded.</p> <p>But the White House wants to restructure or end two programs: a $2.1 billion effort to dispose of hundreds of tons of military plutonium and a program to shrink Russian cities that were devoted to nuclear weapons development, and to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists, the official said in an interview on Friday. Both these programs have been criticized in Congress.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>Buoyed by a successful antimissile test on Saturday, the Pentagon warned Senate Democrats today that a protracted fight over the administration's ambitious missile defense plans would undermine President Bush's effort to overhaul the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty in coming talks with Russia.</p> <p>In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said threats by the Democrats to cut Mr. Bush's proposed $8.3 billion missile defense budget would give Russian leaders ''the mistaken impression that they can somehow exercise a veto over our development of missile defenses.''</p>

['crime and criminals']	<p>John E. Tobin, 24, of Ridgefield, Conn., the Fulbright scholar sentenced in April to serve 37 months on marijuana charges, may find his term reduced for good behavior and could soon be released from a prison camp south of here, a regional spokesman for the Justice Ministry said today.</p> <p>After nearly six months in jails, Mr. Tobin is learning woodworking and attends Orthodox Christian services, the spokesman said. He added that prison officials would probably upgrade Mr. Tobin's living conditions and that a local court could order his early release if the prison requested it.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, offered President Vladimir V. Putin an American blueprint today for talks on building a new nuclear-weapons framework, a process she cast as part of a broader White House plan for ''transforming'' the relationship between Washington and Moscow.</p> <p>Ms. Rice said that President Bush hoped to meet Mr. Putin twice this fall, in Shanghai and in Washington, and that members of Mr. Bush's cabinet were planning trips here in the coming months. Two of them -- Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans -- were in Moscow today, meeting with Mr. Putin and other senior officials.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>In recent statements, Bush administration officials have called for the United States to cast aside so-called relics of the cold war. On Thursday, for example, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told a Senate committee that the administration's missile-defense program will ''inevitably bump up against'' the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ''in months.'' Even the concept of nuclear deterrence is not immune to this desire to clean house. In mid-June President Bush stated his intention to move away from the logic of mutually assured destruction -- ''the capacity of each of us, each country, to blow each other up,'' as he said -- in favor of a new framework based on some combination of strategic offensive and defensive systems.</p> <p>But deterrence, and the agreements that frame it, must continue to be a factor in American-Russian relations for the foreseeable future. Neither the United States nor Russia has committed to the near elimination of strategic nuclear arsenals, which would be required to move away from mutual deterrence. Indeed, both sides seem intent on maintaining large nuclear arsenals in perpetuity. So far, in calling for consultations among the five nuclear powers aimed at cutting American and Russian arsenals to 1,500 warheads each, Moscow has proposed the steepest cuts.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, today repeated a promise to suspend ballistic missile launchings until 2003, saying in a declaration with President Vladimir V. Putin here that his nation's missile program ''does not present a threat to nations respecting North Korea's sovereignty.''</p> <p>The declaration, aimed squarely at the United States' proposal to build a defense against ballistic missile attacks by so-called rogue states, came at a Kremlin meeting of the two leaders that capped Mr. Kim's 10-day journey to Moscow by rail.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>It was not until last summer that anybody here expressed concern that the Salvation Army could be contemplating the violent overthrow of the Russian government.</p> <p>Vladimir Zhbankov, a deputy in the city of Moscow's justice ministry, said the issue has been blown out of proportion.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>Robert P. Hanssen, the former F.B.I. agent, has told the bureau that he spied for two different Soviet intelligence agencies during different periods of his long espionage career, and investigators now believe that decision may have helped protect him from being caught earlier, law enforcement officials said today.</p> <p>Mr. Hanssen, who pleaded guilty to spying for Moscow last month, is being debriefed by counterintelligence experts. In the first disclosures of what he has revealed, law enforcement officials said he had told the bureau that he began spying in 1979, six years earlier than the agency had believed when he was arrested in February. Mr. Hanssen is said to have spied from 1979 through 1981, quit, and then begun to spy again in 1985.</p>
['television']	<p>Kim Jong Il, the leader of North Korea, wound up a two-day visit to this dusty Siberian metropolis today, enlivening a historic state visit to Russia with an eclectic and energetic sampling of musical theater, tank manufacture, pig farming and library science.</p> <p>That's the rumor, anyway. Not many people here actually saw him do these things. Fewer still want to talk about it.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>For a leader as proud as President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan, it came as something of a humiliation when an Iranian warship ordered an Azerbaijan research vessel to stop exploring for oil in the Caspian Sea last month.</p> <p>The unarmed vessel, the Geofizik-3, was leased by the Azerbaijan government to the oil giant BP to explore a promising field in waters generally regarded as belonging to Azerbaijan. But when the Iranians trained their guns on the ship on July 23 and two warplanes buzzed it, the only option was to retreat.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is about to travel 10,000 miles to Moscow and back for one day of talks on missile defense and nuclear reductions at which no agreements are expected -- because, many officials believe, the outcome is preordained and the American position has prevailed.</p> <p>On missile defense, the United States is unyielding.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>Three months ago, the Central Intelligence Agency quietly reinstated a senior counterintelligence officer who had spent 18 months under investigation as a suspected Russian spy. There was no ceremony, no fanfare, no formal apology as he returned from professional exile. But in effect, the C.I.A was saying there had been a terrible mistake.</p> <p>For the C.I.A. officer, whose job is so highly classified that even his name is secret, the aftershocks of his ordeal continue to be felt as he tries to resume a life free of suspicion. He requested that his name not be used in this article because he has been advised that he could lose his covert status if he is identified.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton said tonight that ''a vast open space'' still exists for an agreement with Russia  on joint development of a limited  defense against ballistic missiles,  but that the time for such an accord was running out.</p> <p>Mr. Bolton denied, however, that he had issued an unofficial deadline of November for reaching such an agreement.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Bush's statement on Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the outdated 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty ''at a time convenient to America'' should put to rest any lingering doubts as to his seriousness about building a national missile defense system.</p> <p>We should of course hope that the United States and Russia can agree to replace the treaty with a new framework. But if President Vladimir Putin of Russia insists on clinging to the cold war accord, the administration should not hesitate to exercise its rights under the treaty and give notice of our official withdrawal from it.</p>
['espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>This is a tale of two unveilings. The first came on July 11, 1995. In an unusual ceremony at its Langley, Va., headquarters, the Central Intelligence Agency released to the public, with great fanfare, the long-secret results of one of its greatest coups: a chunk of decrypted 1940's cables from the Soviet Union that included the names and cover names of about 200 American spies. The code name for the American interception and decoding was Venona.</p> <p>After the ceremony came an outpouring. Longtime defenders of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been executed as spies, issued mea culpas. Critics assaulted the new material's credibility; scholars returned home from examining Soviet archives to assert Venona's basic soundness. Books issued forth, and magazines covered the debate's every twist. They still do.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'treaties']	<p>A senior Bush administration official said today that the United States had given Russia an unofficial deadline of November to agree to changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty or face a unilateral American withdrawal from the arms control accord.</p> <p>Speaking in an interview on Russian radio that will be aired on Wednesday evening, the official, John R. Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said after two days of talks with Russian officials that the United States plans to resolve its strategy for withdrawing from the treaty before Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, visits Mr. Bush this fall.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'economic conditions and trends']	<p>Drawing clear battle lines with the White House on foreign policy, Representative Richard A. Gephardt accused the Bush administration today of an obsession with missile defense and of pursuing a unilateralist approach to world affairs that risks antagonizing Russia and undermining relations with Europe.</p> <p>Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader, vowed to unite Democrats and persuade Republicans to forge a bipartisan majority in Congress to block any missile defense system that would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. He also defended formal arms control negotiations as essential to maintaining the nuclear peace.</p>
['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russian judicial authorities indicated today that John E. Tobin, the American Fulbright scholar imprisoned on marijuana-related charges since February, would probably be freed from a prison on the Ukrainian border as early as Friday.</p> <p>A spokesman for the federal Justice Ministry in Voronezh, a regional capital in southwest Russia, said that prison officials have urged a local court to order the early release of Mr. Tobin.</p>

['espionage', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>John E. Tobin Jr., the jailed American Fulbright scholar, walked out of a southwest Russian prison today a free man, paroled hours earlier on a minor marijuana conviction that briefly threatened to blossom into an international espionage drama.</p> <p>A district court in the small town of Rossosh, near the Ukrainian border, ordered Mr. Tobin released this morning at the urging of officials at the prison camp there, who described him as an exemplary inmate. He had served roughly six months of a 37-month sentence -- later reduced to one year -- for possessing less than two-tenths of an ounce of marijuana and sharing it with others. The police said they found marijuana in his clothes and in his apartment after they seized him outside a nightclub in Voronezh, 280 miles south of Moscow.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Secretary of Defense Donald H.

['budgets and budgeting', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic energy', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'energy and power']	<p>A program conceived by the Clinton administration to rid the world of 100 tons of American and Russian weapons-grade plutonium is likely to be abandoned by the Bush administration, according to people who have been briefed about the project.</p> <p>Under the plan, which was first proposed in the mid-90's, 50 tons of American plutonium and 50 tons of Russian plutonium would be taken out of nuclear weapons and either converted into fuel for nuclear reactors or rendered useless for weapons by mixing it with with highly radioactive nuclear waste, a process known as immobilization.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld met President Vladimir V. Putin and his defense minister today for talks that threw into sharp relief the disagreements over whether to deploy missile defenses, how to slash nuclear arsenals and whether arms control talks can even be the tool to bridge their differences.</p> <p>It was a day when Mr. Putin spoke of negotiations and Mr. Rumsfeld spoke of consultations to create a new relationship in which treaties are unnecessary.</p>
['espionage', 'news and news media', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>For anyone who lived in Russia during the height of the cold war, the experience of John E. Tobin Jr., the American Fulbright scholar, may resonate. When Mr. Tobin, accused of being a spy and jailed in Russia for six months on charges of marijuana possession, returned to the United States last week, he denied the accusations. In an e-mail message to officials of the Fulbright program, he also told of something that struck a chord with me -- efforts by Russian intelligence officials to recruit him as a spy.</p> <p>In 1955, I was also approached about being a spy -- not in prison, but in the lobby of the Bolshoi Theater during an intermission of the ballet ''Giselle.'' A Russian claiming to be a journalist told me he wanted to exchange views. A few days later he called on me in my room at the National Hotel. Feigning concern about hidden microphones, he turned my shortwave radio to full volume and,  whispering in my ear, launched into an account of a Soviet naval accident in the Black Sea that he said had resulted in many casualties. Clearly, he was trying to induce me to write a story on a subject that could bring charges of espionage against an American journalist -- particularly if true. I listened but took no notes to avoid any evidence of complicity.</p>

I scanned my brain for an analogy and finally said: Imagine how Egyptians would feel if three suicide bombers rammed airplanes into the Pyramids, with thousands of people inside. The World Trade towers were our Pyramids, built with glass and steel rather than stones, but Pyramids to American enterprise and free markets, and someone has destroyed them.</p> <p>I'm still not sure the world fully appreciates what this has meant to Americans. We are not fighting for Kosovo, and we are not fighting for Bosnia, Somalia or Kuwait. We are fighting for our country.

We believe that, first of all, attention must be paid to strengthening the role of those international institutions that were created to strengthen international security. These are the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council.

['immigration and refugees']	<p>Ten years ago this week, when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Russia returned the historic name of St. Petersburg to Leningrad, the city's citizens did not feel universal delight. A referendum had found only 54 percent of voters in favor of the change. The still-powerful Communist Party had asked that ''there be no mockery of the name of glorious Leningrad, hero-city, warrior- and laborer-city.'' The newspaper Sovest (Conscience) demanded hysterically: ''Why rename our city? So that dead tsarism can breathe on us again?'' In reply, liberals organized a noisy demonstration under the slogan ''Lenin's name shames a great city!''</p> <p>Everyone understood that at issue was not simply the city's name but an important ideological symbol.

['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Just how much the world has changed, at least on the surface, becomes clear to me somewhere above Irkutsk, on board an Air China flight from Beijing to Moscow. My fellow passengers are mostly Chinese with a scattering of Russians. The in-flight entertainment consists of contemporary Chinese soap operas and old movies about revolutionary heroes battling various fascist enemies. But above Irkutsk we are provided with a History Channel documentary about the superiority of United States Navy destroyers. Phrases like ''fighting for freedom'' and ''the American spirit'' come gushing through our headphones as Navy helicopters release torpedoes and the guns of freedom boom. I look around to gauge Russian and Chinese reactions. Most people are fast asleep.</p> <p>The reason for flying this route is to test a hypothesis, or rather, a commonly received opinion, which is that the Chinese are managing their transition from Communism to capitalism better than the Russians. Russia is a mess, its economy wrecked in the Yeltsin years by ideology-driven shock treatment and grasping oligarchs, its daily life made a misery by widespread corruption and criminal rackets. China, on the other hand, is believed to have learned its lesson from the Russian experience. Mikhail Gorbachev's ''failure'' serves as a warning to the Chinese leaders against political reforms that would diminish the party's grip on power. Bolstered by enormous amounts of overseas Chinese investment, they have concentrated on economic reforms instead. Almost nobody in China, including most party cadres, actually believes in Communism. But an authoritarian one-party state fits the Chinese tradition, and most Chinese prefer it to the potential disorder of hasty democratization.</p>

['terrorism']	<p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon returns to Israel today after two days of meetings in Moscow with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>That struck me as odd; what was Sharon doing there during what some Israelis call ''the Rosh Hashana war,'' the violence that began as they celebrated the Jewish New Year one year ago? Are the Russians, who are also meeting with Palestinian leaders, trying to insinuate themselves into Middle East negotiations?</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>President Bush ordered heavy bombers and other aircraft to within easy  striking distance of Afghanistan today and insisted that its ruling Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden and other suspected leaders of a terrorist organization believed to be behind last week's attacks in New York and Washington.</p> <p>The White House also announced that Mr. Bush would address a joint  meeting of Congress on Thursday evening to lay out his aims for what he has called a global war on terrorism and to detail the sacrifices that might be asked of the American public.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The world's governments expressed solidarity tonight with the United States as a democracy under attack, and European Union foreign ministers and NATO ambassadors planned separate meetings on Wednesday to discuss what can be done in a common battle against terrorism.</p> <p>There was quiet discussion among European officials tonight about how, in the event that the United States struck back at whomever was responsible, European governments and even militaries could assist. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also expressed support for retaliation.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>Without any systematic analysis, without the usual process of review  among government departments, the United States has adopted an entirely new foreign policy. By elevating the fight against terrorism to the highest priority, the Bush administration has changed the basic premises of American involvement overseas. America's policy now implies the formation of a new antiterrorist alliance with Russia, China and India as well as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan and other nations.</p> <p>Such a great-power alliance for international order has not been seen since the mid-19th century, when the threat came from liberal revolutionaries rather than religious fanatics.  Inevitably, the new foreign policy collides with old priorities, whether in regard to human rights in China, for example, or missile defense, which can no longer be imposed on Russia because we need it as an ally.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>Iran's defense minister arrived in Moscow today to conclude long-delayed talks on a large purchase of Russian arms, an agenda now likely to be joined by discussions of Tehran's role in a global campaign against terror.</p> <p>The United States, which bitterly opposed the sale of Russian weapons to Iran but just as clearly wants to keep both nations enlisted in that campaign, is certain to be watching the talks closely.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'law and legislation', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The exiled king of Afghanistan and leaders of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance agreed today to convene an emergency ''Supreme Council'' here by the end of this month, as a first step toward  replacing their country's militant Islamic rulers.</p> <p>The council would be ready to step in if the Taliban is forced out, they said. Both the former king and the opposition commanders made clear that they believe that their plan is a way not just to rid their country of the Taliban, but to avoid American reprisals against Afghanistan, where the terror suspect Osama bin Laden is under Taliban protection.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>European leaders quickly voiced support for the military operations begun today by the United States and Britain against targets in Afghanistan, with France and Germany saying they could eventually take part as well.</p> <p>In Russia, which used to put its air-defense system on alert whenever American forces made significant moves, the Foreign Ministry instead issued a statement of support, saying the ''time had come for decisive action'' against terrorism.</p>

['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The terror attacks of Sept. 11 forced an immediate and radical shift in American relations with the rest of the world. What had been a drifting search for a foreign policy by a new Republican administration suddenly acquired a hard, overarching purpose, in which friends and foes were coldly redefined according to whether they were with the United States or against it.</p> <p>The realignments have been staggering. A few short weeks ago, Washington viewed Central Asia, if it viewed the region at all, as a nest of nasty despots; Russia was a nagging has-been doing bad things in Chechnya, and the United Nations was a bloated organization whose conference on racism had to be boycotted. The Mideast was a quagmire, but the real threats were in Asia -- the rogues in North Korea and the increasingly assertive rulers in China.</p>

['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>Throughout the 1990's, any use of force by the United States sent President Boris Yeltsin of Russia into a red-faced fury. No matter the target, he would fulminate about Washington's arrogance, invoke Russia's nuclear might, even warn of World War III. Mr. Yeltsin's outbursts were brief but ferocious, and they reflected a widespread conviction among Russians that deep down, America's interests were different from theirs.</p> <p>Now comes Vladimir Putin -- by instinct and training a less likely friend of the United States than was Mr. Yeltsin -- to offer support in our struggle against terrorism. His presence on President Bush's bandwagon is more than just a reversal of Russian policy on America's use of force. Mr. Putin, unlike his predecessor, seems to believe that there is a domestic consensus, or that he can create one, in favor of a broad rapprochement between Russia and the West.</p>

['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>War changes everything. The war against terrorism, now a hot war in Afghanistan, has this in common with the cold war: It affects all parts of the world and reshapes their politics. How will it reshape Europe?</p> <p>I have been in eight European countries over the last three weeks, talking to political leaders, intellectuals, guerrilla chiefs in the mountains of Macedonia and ordinary people in the streets of Madrid, Paris, Warsaw and other capitals.

['airlines and airplanes', 'medicine and health', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>Let's call it what it is: Sending mail laced with anthrax is an act of terrorism. Terrorists aim to cause terror, and in this they have succeeded, up to a point. The run on Cipro at pharmacies demonstrates that. If they also aim to use biological weapons to kill on a large scale, they have not succeeded -- not yet.</p> <p>To ensure their failure we need to act fast, following a largely scientific  path. At the end of that path the politics of responding to this form of terrorism will enter the picture. It will be a dark picture if it is discovered that the anthrax spread in the United States was supplied by a state.</p>

Bush is not leaving his command post in terrorist wartime primarily to save the world from recession. Interminable blather about opening up markets is what China's Jiang Zemin wants most. The Chinese leader's diplomatic legions, drawn up in vast cumbrous array, will issue reams of plans for a ''Shanghai round'' of negotiations, but what makes this Bush trip necessary is getting, face to face, a promise of intelligence sharing about terror groups, to be followed by arrests and extradition.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>As if to prove that he has survived the heaviest American bombing so far in Afghanistan, the Taliban's supreme leader broke four days of silence today with an appeal to his soldiers not to buckle under pressure from the United States.</p> <p>''We are confronted with a big infidel,'' Mullah Muhammad Omar said in an address relayed to Taliban troops over a military radio network that appears to be the Taliban's last remaining communications system.

['airlines and airplanes', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>A dozen years ago in Termez, a dusty Uzbekistan border town that may again become a dateline, I watched the Russian Army begin its retreat from Afghanistan. As paratroopers crossed a railroad bridge into the waiting arms of parents and girlfriends, an all-girl, all-drum band from a local school tapped out a cheerless homecoming rhythm. When I asked the soldiers what they had accomplished down there, expecting at least a rehearsed sample of national pride, they would stare blankly. ''We survived,'' one weary private shrugged. The war that had sent home 15,000 zinc coffins had also killed off a lot of illusions.</p> <p>No, this is not another warning about the perils of Afghanistan. The American officials I've talked to understand the frustrations of playing hide-and-seek in a mountain labyrinth. They appreciate the lethal instability of that country's tribal politics. The risks they take will be as calculated as they are justified.</p>

If so, that would free the United States to test a proposed antimissile system while meeting Moscow's demand not to abandon the treaty altogether.</p> <p>Both men were elusive in their comments, but Mr. Putin's remarks made clear that the two nations were racing to try to reach the outlines of an accord before Mr. Putin travels to Washington and to Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., from Nov. 12 to 14.</p>

Putin called tonight for Russia and the United States to bury the vestiges of their cold war suspicions and form an alliance with ''a qualitatively new level'' of trust.</p> <p>Underscoring that, he said emphatically that Russia did not regard the mushrooming role of the United States in Central Asia, the heartland of the former Soviet Union, as either a strategic or an economic threat.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'world trade center (nyc)', 'terrorism']	<p>The NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, proposed today to give Russia equal status with the alliance's 19 permanent members in devising and executing some policies, a change that probably would bring Moscow into the center of NATO deliberations on terrorism and other issues.</p> <p>The proposal, which Lord Robertson said has the support of President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other NATO leaders, implies that Russia would have veto power over certain alliance decisions, he said.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today with students at Crawford High School, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Putin's remarks were interpreted by a translator.</p> <p>PRESIDENT BUSH: I wanted to bring President Putin to Crawford. I wanted him to see a state that Laura and I love. I particularly wanted him -- to be able to introduce him to the citizens of Crawford, because it's part of the state that represents the independent-minded nature of Texans. . . . We had a great dinner last night. We had a little Texas barbecue, pecan pie, a little Texas music, and I think the president really enjoyed himself. I told him he was welcome to come back next August to get a true taste of Crawford. He said, ''Fine. And maybe you'd like to go to Siberia in the winter.'' . . .</p> <p>We've got a lot to do together. We've had great discussions in Washington, as well as here in Texas. We're both pledging to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons, offensive weapons, we have in order to make the world more secure. We're talking about ways to cooperate in antiterrorism and antiproliferation. We're talking about ways to make sure our economies can grow together.</p>

The skies were clear, the day was delightfully balmy, the Marathon went smoothly, with new records for men and women, the historic Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan reopened for normal Sunday worship, and the talk over brunches in packed sidewalk cafes was not anthrax, for a change, but whether the Yankees could recover from the previous night's drubbing.</p> <p>A DAY OF REST, MAINLY -- The crisis, to be sure, was always hovering in the background. The 25,000 participants in the New York City Marathon were warned not to accept any refreshments from unknown bystanders, and red, white and blue were the ubiquitous colors of the race. There was also a new report that a trace of anthrax had been found on a package sent to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's chief of staff from NBC News.</p>

['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The rout of the Taliban from Afghan cities continued apace yesterday, and there were reports that Pashtun tribes in the south, the ethnic base of the Taliban, were rising up and challenging the Taliban even in its stronghold of Kandahar.</p> <p>Reports from around Afghanistan indicated that as much as 80 percent of the country now appeared to be out of the control of the Taliban, some of it in the hands of the rebel Northern Alliance. But with the situation in Afghanistan in total flux, it was difficult to discern which forces or factions controlled which areas -- or how much fight was left in the Taliban, the Islamic radicals who had imposed their rigid rule on most of the country for seven years.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Vladimir V. Putin may have looked relaxed out here on the Texas prairie this afternoon, riding shotgun as he bounced along in President Bush's gleaming pickup.</p> <p>But he still hasn't agreed to amend or walk away from an arms control treaty that prohibits the kind of antimissile system that Mr. Bush wants to test. Even Mr. Bush's pledge on Tuesday to cut America's nuclear arsenal by two-thirds did not succeed at that. So tonight, at the rambling stone house that the Bushes have just completed on the prairies and in the canyons that cut through central Texas, the president shifted to Plan B.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>A combination of heavy-duty bombs and more precise target information from Russia and from American Special Operations forces on the ground have helped the United States escalate attacks on caves and tunnels in Afghanistan that have been identified as Taliban arms depots and command centers, military officials said today.</p> <p>The bombing, which has included the use of 5,000-pound bunker-busters, came as American Special Operations forces deepened their involvement in the conflict. Today, commandos spirited out of southern Afghanistan a prominent opposition leader, Hamid Karzai, who has been trying to organize a rebellion in the Taliban's stronghold, a military official said.</p>

['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'crime and criminals', 'elections', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The night of Oct. 15 found Colin Powell inside the heavily fortified residence of the American ambassador in Islamabad, dining with his improbable new best friend, the president of Pakistan. Just a few months earlier, when the Bush administration was beginning to compose its tableau of friends and foes, a Powell deputy was sent to court India, a democracy and possible counterweight to China, as America's darling in South Asia. Pakistan was passed over as a terrorist-cradling rogue nation. But war changes everything, and Gen. Pervez Musharraf was now our partner against the terrorists in neighboring Afghanistan. This was Powell's first face-to-face meeting with the Pakistani strongman, and he was impressed with what he found. Like Powell himself, Musharraf was a pragmatic military man, brimming with self-assurance, equally at ease talking tactical soldiery or political strategy, a man given to thinking three or four steps ahead.</p> <p>Powell was in Islamabad to reassure the Pakistanis that the United States would not, as it had in the past, abandon Pakistan once the war was over and to proffer some tangible rewards, including an end to sanctions imposed to punish Pakistan's nuclear testing and help in rescheduling a staggering national debt. This was a gamble for Musharraf, enlisting with America against a viral Islamic hatred incubated, among other places, in Pakistan. The streets were simmering with angry protests. As a precaution against a stray shoulder-fired missile, Powell had ended his 17-hour flight with a lights-out, banking dive into the Islamabad airport. And for security reasons, the dinner was not listed on the schedule handed out to his traveling press entourage.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'treaties']	<p>When President Bush and Vladimir Putin meet next week, one aim will be to resolve differences about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. With much at stake in the war against terror and in Russia's hopes to be seen as a part of the West, no one wants the developing closeness of the United States and Russia to be held back by the old argument about an American missile shield.</p> <p>Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration was saying bluntly that the ABM treaty, banning most missile defense, was anachronistic and that the United States might simply break it. Now the need for Russian support in the Afghanistan war makes cooperation more attractive than unilateral pronouncements. But this issue is not as difficult as it seems. The treaty could be modified fairly easily to allow what we need to do.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Russia's foreign minister appeared to rule out today the prospect that President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin would sign a major arms-control agreement when they meet this month at Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas.</p> <p>In remarks to reporters here, the foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said ''difficult consultations'' continued to block a restructuring of the arms-control framework that has governed the two nations' nuclear policies since the 1960's.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'religion and churches', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>As scores of world leaders converge on New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly, Osama bin Laden's latest message to the world has provoked profound new security concerns for the United Nations and its global work force.</p> <p>How to respond to Mr. bin Laden's perceived threats is far from clear. In his message, he singled out not only the United Nations, but various world leaders -- either implicitly or by name, as was the case with  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Analysts say that his oratory is further proof of his shrewdness in assessing the mood of both the West and the Muslim world, as well as his ability to take advantage of both.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>After a recent meeting with Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, Secretary of State Colin Powell proclaimed a new era: ''Not only is the cold war over, the post-cold war period is also over.'' When President Vladimir Putin visits President Bush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., next week, they will have an extraordinary opportunity to turn Secretary Powell's encouraging words into reality. Unfortunately, they will have their work cut out for them -- the nuclear arsenals of the two nations are still stuck in the cold war.</p> <p>The United States and Russia continue to maintain a combined total of over 13,000 long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons, with the only plausible targets of such destructive power being each other. The two nations also have an estimated 6,000 tactical nuclear weapons -- currently operational warheads intended for use on short-range battlefield sytems -- most of them on the Russian side. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, among others, has pointed out how preposterous this is. Nonetheless the United States and Russia still have prompt retaliatory war plans, with over 4,000 warheads ready to be launched in a matter of minutes. These missiles cannot be stopped once fired. Russia's deteriorating command and control system further increases the risk of an inadvertent or mistaken launch.</p>

Putin of Russia pledged today to cut their nuclear stockpiles by roughly two-thirds over the next decade, leaving each side with fewer than 2,200 warheads.</p> <p>But the two nations still seemed far apart on missile defenses, with Mr. Putin resisting American efforts for a quick agreement that would allow Mr. Bush to conduct tests that would violate the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>President Bush did not mention it, but the arms control approach he presented today would undo one of the signal accomplishments of his father's administration: the ban on multiple-warhead missiles based on land.</p> <p>Throughout the cold war, it was widely assumed that such missiles were particularly destabilizing weapons. NATO was so worried about the Soviet Union's 10-warhead SS-18 that its code name for the missile was Satan, and Reagan administration hard-liners warned darkly that it would be useful for a surprise strike.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>The people who run Russia's companies and oversee its economy did not draft a formal wish list of economic measures for President Vladimir V. Putin to raise with George Bush as they meet this week. That is because what they want from the United States can be boiled down to one point: stop treating Russia like an enemy economy.</p> <p>As Russia moves to integrate its economy with the rest of the world's, business leaders and government officials here say that more support is needed from America to smooth the way. American officials say that they are doing what they can, but that they cannot move faster than Congress and other countries' governments will allow.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The events of Sept. 11 shattered any illusion that America is secure from foreign attack. As horrible as that day was, future attacks could be far more deadly. If terrorists had used a nuclear weapon in lower Manhattan, hundreds of thousands might have died.</p> <p>President Bush has noted the potential threat we face if Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups obtain weapons of mass destruction. These groups are seeking chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, he told European leaders last week. If they obtain them, they will be a threat ''to every nation and eventually to civilization itself.''</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'world trade center (nyc)', 'terrorism']	<p>Within 48 hours of September's terrorist strikes, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned Gen.

['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The seven-week military campaign in Afghanistan has given the world a stark view of a new American doctrine to make war on the sources of terrorism in the world. But with the defeat of the Taliban perhaps only days away and the hunt for Osama bin Laden intensifying, the force of the American destruction of Afghan targets has sent an unambiguous warning far beyond the war theater to a number of nations that continue to provide bases and training to terrorist groups. The warning is: this could happen to you.</p> <p>Yet how President Bush takes the war campaign from phase one in Afghanistan to phase two against Al Qaeda and other ''global reach'' terrorist groups in dozens of other countries remains an unsettled and, in some quarters, an unsettling question.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Russia and the United States said today that they had agreed to complete negotiations on a new strategic arms control accord that could codify a significant reduction in offensive weapons -- to about 2,000 weapons each -- even if they do not reach agreement on missile defenses.</p> <p>After meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said for the first time that the accord might take the form of a treaty, something the Bush administration has resisted in its quest to act unilaterally in structuring the American nuclear arsenal for the future.</p>

['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Because of Moscow's exploding middle class, you quickly notice two things driving around this increasingly European city -- sushi bars are opening all over (yes, from borscht to Big Macs to California-Kremlin rolls in one decade!) and so many people have cars now that traffic is permanently snarled (imagine Jakarta with snow and ice and you've got today's Moscow). So sitting in gridlock the other day in Pushkin Square, I had plenty of time to ask my Russian friend Viktor a cosmic question: Is your life easier or harder now than it was under Communism?</p> <p>''Both,'' he remarked. ''It's easier because I don't have to hunt for food every day and wait in lines for everything. Stores are full now. No lines. But it all costs a lot of money. The saying here now is that there is only one line left in Russia -- the line for money.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'terrorism', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Hoping to prevent the global economic slowdown from further eroding world oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries finalized an agreement today to cut back oil production by 6.5 percent, or 1.5 million barrels a day, for at least six months starting Jan. 1.</p> <p>The decision, made at an emergency meeting of OPEC ministers here, followed a pledge by non-OPEC oil producers -- principally Russia, Norway and Mexico -- to reduce their exports by 462,500 barrels a day. OPEC officials prompted the non-OPEC nations to act using barely veiled threats of a price war.</p>

The judge returned the case to the lower court for reconsideration -- but the bankruptcy law underpinning the case will in any event be replaced when the new year rolls in Tuesday, a fact that elated the network's managers.</p>

['treaties', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Russian defense minister declared today that his nation's security was not threatened by President Bush's decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, but he warned of a dangerous new arms race -- not of countries building more weapons, but of more countries scrapping arms-control treaties.</p> <p>After their first meeting since Mr. Bush's announcement last week, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld emerged from talks with his counterpart, Sergei B. Ivanov, to say he welcomed greater Russian participation in the 19-member NATO alliance.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Next year, unless President Bush has a drastic change of heart, the United States will enlarge the American-led military alliance in Europe by as many as seven countries and extend its boundary to within an hour's tank drive of St. Petersburg. This may seem like an awfully ungrateful way to treat our new friend Russia, so quick to our side after Sept. 11, but the terror attacks have actually made this enlargement of the NATO family more right than ever.</p> <p>In fact, if he is not too distracted by fighting a war abroad and shredding civil liberties at home, Mr. Bush has a chance to accomplish three grand purposes in a single feat of political choreography: consolidating the gains of free-market democracy, drawing Russia closer to Europe, and rejuvenating our most important alliance.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'terrorism', 'treaties']	<p>When President Bush stepped into the Rose Garden on Thursday morning, he did far more than announce America's exit from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. He buried an entire era of arms control.</p> <p>Whether it deserved to die, or was killed off prematurely, will be debated endlessly by ideologues and experts who have sharply different views about the wisdom of walking away from accords that some argue have helped prevent nuclear war for almost 30 years.</p> <p>But the most interesting arguments in Washington, Moscow and Beijing this week are less about the wisdom of what Mr. Bush did than about what comes next. For while nuclear confrontation between superpowers seems more unlikely than ever, the probability of nuclear, biological or chemical calamity delivered by stray missile, cargo ship or mail seems greater than ever.</p> <p>And that requires a very different kind of arms control, taking forms Mr. Bush has already begun to consider. ''Clearly we are not against all arms treaties,'' the president's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said several months ago, ticking off a short list of accords Mr. Bush thinks are a good idea, chiefly the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. ''But the threats have changed and with them the definition of our interests has to be adjusted.''</p> <p>Gone forever, in the Bush view, is the age in which American negotiators and their Russian counterparts haggled for months or years over multiple warheads and megatonnage, throw-weights and basing modes. Mr. Bush recently recalled how, in years past, watching television news meant ''seeing that people would sit at tables for hours and hours and hours trying to reach reduced levels of nuclear armament.''</p> <p>It is a waste of time, the president argues. But the deeper problem for Mr. Bush is that he wants freedom -- freedom to test new defensive technologies, freedom to cut America's offensive arsenal to the minimum levels he considers safe for Americans, without regard for what other countries think.</p> <p>The ABM Treaty was all about constraints, and that is why it became a lightning rod for conservatives and for proponents of missile defenses. They knew there was no way to test, much less deploy, an effective missile defense system without violating its terms. But only when relations with Russia warmed over the past few years did those who supported keeping the old structure in place begin to concede Mr. Bush's point that the treaty is a ''relic'' born of a bygone era of confrontation.</p> <p>''The problem isn't Russia and hasn't been for a long time,'' said James Steinberg, President Bill Clinton's deputy national security adviser. ''Everyone hopes that one day Russia and its nuclear arsenal will be viewed the way we view Britain's or France's. But we're not there yet, and so many of the arguments are about what kind of transitional arrangements we need.''</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin told the Russian people on television on Thursday that the demise of the ABM Treaty is not likely to change the strategic balance between Russia and the United States. He said he plans to retain 1,500 to 2,200 nuclear missiles -- about the numbers Mr. Bush announced last month for the American arsenal -- which is enough to overwhelm any missile defenses now on the drawing board.</p> <p>The mutual reduction is also a significant advantage for Mr. Putin, because Russia cannot afford to sustain a large arsenal. SeniorRussian officials have declared the ABM Treaty ''strategically irrelevant.''</p> <p>In short, Russia is the easier part of the equation. The far harder issues -- arguably more difficult now that Mr. Bush has shown his willingness to scuttle a treaty -- involve keeping the lid on established nuclear powers like China and new nuclear ones like Pakistan. China has complained about the American plans to build missile defenses and warned it would build up its nuclear stockpile in response. It is feared that Pakistan's stockpiles could fall into the hands of disgruntled military officers or Islamic fundamentalists with ties to Al Qaeda.</p> <p>And then there are concerns about  countries like Iraq or North Korea, or nuclear-armed terrorists, who dream of delivering nuclear weapons that arrive with no return address.</p> <p>The very existence of the ABM Treaty for the past 29 years meant that China did not have to worry that either Washington or Moscow would construct a missile defense system that would neutralize its minimal force of 20 or so intercontinental ballistic missiles. Long before Mr. Bush came to office, China said it planned to ''modernize'' that force, meaning it would slowly become bigger and more accurate.</p> <p>But now that Mr. Bush is free to build missile defenses, China is likely to speed up that effort -- or so the American intelligence community warned a year ago. ''That's the real problem here,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''China will speed up. And I just saw the Indian ambassador, who nodded and said that would put pressure for India to do the same. And then, of course, the Pakistanis match the Indians. Pretty soon, you've started another arms race.''</p> <p>Perhaps with that in mind, Mr. Bush called President Jiang Zemin of China on Thursday and offered to start up broad strategic talks. That doesn't mean talks on a treaty, the administration says, but on making sure each country understands the other.</p> <p>''It's about a lot more than offensive reductions on our part, and on what they have said for a long time will be a build-up on their part,'' said Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, in an interview today. ''It'll be a bit on missile defenses, some on conventional weapons, some about not doing things that heighten tensions with Taiwan.''</p> <p>Pakistan represents a different kind of problem. It has never signed a major nuclear treaty, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has always kept out international inspectors. Pakistani officials say that just as Mr. Bush wants freedom to test his defense systems, they want freedom to test and build their nuclear answer to India's arsenal.</p> <p>Mr. Armitage said today that the administration's goals with Pakistan were basic. ''We're a long way from talking'' about the nonproliferation treaty, he said. ''We are interested in making sure their nuclear programs are secure, that their materials are properly stored, among other things.''</p> <p>While Mr. Armitage was too diplomatic to say so, those talks have become particularly urgent since the Central Intelligence Agency began identifying Pakistani nuclear scientists of dubious loyalties. And it means that the United States is counting on its ability to pressure Pakistan politically, rather than fitting it into a treaty framework.</p> <p>Then come Iraq and North Korea, where Mr. Bush demands that nuclear inspectors must be allowed free rein. So far, both countries have refused. And that may set up the true post-arms control, post-Sept. 11 confrontation: Dealing diplomatically, and perhaps militarily, with countries that could supply or launch nuclear weapons long before Mr. Bush's missile defenses are ready.</p>

['airlines and airplanes', 'foreign aid', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>There is speculation now about whether President Bush will visit Afghanistan once the American bombing campaign ceases and the new government is established in Kabul. If he does go, he will not be the first American president to make the journey. On Dec. 9, 1959, Dwight D. Eisenhower, while on a goodwill mission to Central Asia and the Middle East, made a pilgrimage to Kabul. There, he met with the eager, 45-year-old Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah -- the same king many now would like to see return from exile to reclaim the throne in Kabul.</p> <p>Eisenhower had long been eager to visit that strange and forbidding land. ''It was a boyhood dream of his to see the Khyber Pass and size up how tough their soldiers were,'' Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, who served as Eisenhower's assistant on that trip, recently recalled. On the morning of Dec. 9, Eisenhower, who had been in Karachi to discuss Pakistan's troublesome relationship with India with President Mohammad Ayub Khan, flew from Pakistan to Bagram Airport, 38 miles from Kabul. The flight, as reported by Russell Baker in The Times, was harrowing: as the president's jet swooped across the snow-capped peaks dividing Pakistan from Afghanistan and prepared to land, ''six Soviet MIG-17's flown by Afghan pilots streaked out to escort it in.'' This was no accident: Soviet aid had been pouring into the country since 1955, when Nikita Khrushchev had visited. The Kremlin was eager to give Ike a little reminder that it was in charge in this supposedly neutral nation. This was just the beginning of one of the most curious days of Eisenhower's presidency.</p>

Not long ago everybody wondered what was in store for mankind in the 21st century. Many expressed doubts that Russian-American relations would retain their key role in world politics. On Sept. 11, all these issues appeared in a completely different light. The barbaric acts of terrorists in New York and Washington were indeed a tragedy of worldwide scale. It is no coincidence that President Vladimir Putin compared them with the Nazi crimes of World War II.</p> <p>Half a century ago Russia and the United States, despite enormous political differences, combined efforts against Nazism. Now we are joined by common democratic values, and it is even more obvious that a struggle against a world threat requires the cooperation of our countries and the entire world community.

This dictum served as a national idea of sorts until Czar Nicholas I replaced it in the 19th century with the triad Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality. As national ideas go, it sounded good, but it was vague enough for Count Alexander Benkendorf, the chief of the secret police, to issue clarifying interpretive guidelines: ''Russia's past was amazing, its present is more than marvelous, and as for the future, it is greater than anything the wildest imagination could picture; that is the point of view for examining and writing Russian history.''</p>

['taxation', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Steel producers from around the world angrily denounced President Bush's decision today to impose protective tariffs on imported steel and vowed to fight the plan at the World Trade Organization.</p> <p>More ominously for the Bush administration, many trade experts said today that the United States was on shaky legal ground. Over the last two years, the United States has lost at least three smaller cases in which it tried to restrict imports on the same legal principle cited in the steel case today.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>As he had promised for weeks, Boris A. Berezovsky, the Russian tycoon-in-exile, released part of a film today claiming to document the role of the Kremlin's intelligence service in the 1999 string of apartment-house bombings in which more than 300 Russians perished.</p> <p>Russian authorities have blamed Islamic extremists from Chechnya for the bombings. But Mr. Berezovsky, in part of a long-running struggle with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, escalated his accusations today, saying that Mr. Putin knew ''at a minimum'' that intelligence services were tied to the bombings yet still failed to stop them.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'foreign aid', 'crime and criminals', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>Just after midcentury, when the great powers vied for influence in Afghanistan with aid, not arms, Americans essentially built this city on the Helmand River. It was a suburban Shangri-La created by corporate colonialism, its showpiece a state-of-the-art public hospital that drew patients from hundreds of miles around.</p> <p>The city anchored what was to be the Tennessee Valley Authority of Afghanistan, a multimillion-dollar American project to use dams and irrigation canals to transform desert into a lush breadbasket. The Americans called it Bost, for the ruins of an ancient city nearby. So many settled here with their families that the Afghans called it ''Little America.''</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov of Russia warned today that the American proposal in arms reduction talks to ''warehouse'' excess warheads instead of destroying them would not only encourage nuclear proliferation, but could even set off a new kind of arms race.</p> <p>Mr. Ivanov's statement, in written answers to questions from The New York Times, was issued as he flew to Washington for four days of talks on arms control, terrorism and other issues. It underscored the fact that despite hopes of sealing a major arms reduction agreement by late May, when President Bush plans to visit Moscow, the two sides remain at loggerheads as to what arms reduction actually means.</p>

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The wholesale reduction of strategic nuclear weapons announced today may help sustain the slow-motion momentum of Russia's realignment toward the West, and it may give the architect of that realignment, President Vladimir V.

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'treaties']	<p>The strategic arms reductions that the United States and Russia announced today represent radical cutbacks impossible to even ponder during the cold war, despite the warhead storage issues that remain.</p> <p>But though the nuclear arms reductions are a critical milestone in cleaning up the legacy of the cold war, the treaty that President Bush and Vladimir V.

['treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>True, they didn't call it the Pootie-Dubya show. But Vladimir V. Putin and George W. Bush went to some lengths today to make the point that this meeting of the Russian and American presidents, so heavily promoted as the après-cold-war summit meeting, has a mellower and warmer feel to it than any of its predecessors.</p> <p>Indeed, it seemed at times to be almost cuddly, in a dark-suited, wing-tipped sort of way, at least compared with previous ones.</p>
['treaties', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>They would seem, at first glance, one of the oddest couples in global diplomacy: the American president, who never set foot in Russia until Thursday, and the Russian president, who speaks German but little English and had no discernible interest in ranch life or Texas barbecue until he visited the president in Crawford last November.</p> <p>The first, by his own account, drifted between college and age 40. The second headed right from college to the austere Soviet State Security Service, and left it only 11 years ago. But in five meetings over the last 11 months -- as many as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev had in four years -- the two men have come to talk about each other as stalwart partners, hailing their friendship today at the signing of an arms control treaty that they argue will bury the cold war.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>In a day devoted to celebrating what President Bush called ''an entirely new relationship'' with Russia, he and President Vladimir V. Putin signed a treaty today to commit their nations to the most dramatic nuclear arms cuts in decades. But both men tried to smooth over a disagreement about continued Russian exports of nuclear technology to Iran.</p> <p>The three-page Treaty of Moscow was signed early this afternoon inside the Kremlin, in a 300-year-old throne room built by the Russian czars and used today to end what Mr. Bush called ''a long chapter of confrontation.'' While that confrontation has steadily eased since the Soviet empire began to unravel in 1989, the accord today cleared the way for what Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin hailed as a new era of cooperation focused on counterterrorism, trade, Russia's new relationship with NATO and halting the spread of nuclear arms,</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said today that they had made substantial headway toward negotiating an agreement on reducing nuclear weapons that could be signed by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit meeting in Russia in three weeks.</p> <p>After a day of meetings at the White House and the State Department, the two men acknowledged that differences remained, though they declined to offer details. But the tenor of their remarks left little doubt that there was growing optimism on both sides that a pact could be hammered out in time for the meeting, on May 23.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism']	<p>More than 50 years after its founding and a decade after the end of the cold war, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved an agreement today accepting Russia, the former enemy it was formed to fight, into a new partnership with the allies on terrorism, arms control and international crisis management in a post-Sept. 11 world.</p> <p>''Together, the countries that spent four decades glowering at each other across the wall of hatred and fear now have the opportunity to transform Euro-Atlantic security for the better,'' the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, said at a meeting of foreign ministers here.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The United States expects Russia to join it in a high-priority effort to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction, now that deep cuts in their own nuclear arsenals are assured, a senior Bush administration official said here today.</p> <p>One American priority will be Russia's own ties to Iran. There is ''a wide range of cooperation'' by Russia with Iran in its efforts to develop both nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies, the official said.</p>
['treaties']	<p>When the Treaty of Rome was signed in March 1957, laying the groundwork for what is today the European Union, the heads of the six founding nations put their signatures to paper in the august main hall of a palazzo designed by Michelangelo.</p> <p>When the leaders of NATO and Russia meet on Tuesday to sign a treaty of cooperation at an air base just outside the Italian capital, they will do so in a setting that one Rome paper described today as a ''Disneyland for the powerful.''</p>
['religion and churches', 'immigration and refugees', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Bush, who last week compressed a scheduled half-hour of Kremlin sightseeing into a seven-minute blur, was supposed to spend 20 minutes this morning at the Grand Choral Synagogue here before leaving for tea with President Vladimir V. Putin and an Air Force One flight to France.</p> <p>Mr. Bush confounded his schedulers again, but this time by staying longer. He lingered for a half-hour or more past his departure time today to listen to stories of the life, death and rebirth of the synagogue, the only Jewish house of worship in a city of 4.5 million people.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>In the Kremlin office of President Vladimir V. Putin hangs a portrait of the founder of this glorious, if faded, city, Mr. Putin's hometown and the object of his fierce pride.</p> <p>The founder, Peter the Great, was Russia's first imperial czar. But more than that, he was Russia's great Westernizer, the ruler who scoured Europe for the best of its culture and science, then made it Russia's own.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'freedom and human rights', 'television', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Bush is poised to have a terrific trip on his first visit to Russia. He will sign an agreement with President Vladimir Putin that will eliminate thousands of nuclear weapons. He and Mr. Putin will celebrate a new, closer relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia, paving the way for an uneventful expansion of the alliance this fall. Mr. Bush will proclaim Russia a market economy and urge Russian integration into the West. Finally, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin will make joint statements about their shared commitment to the war on terrorism.</p> <p>The summit will be only a partial success, however, if Bush fails to push for greater democracy. Soviet, then Russian, democratization was indispensable in preparing all the achievements of the upcoming summit. Autocratic Russia opposed NATO, resisted arms control and suppressed markets. Democratic Russia has sought to join the West and cooperate with the United States. A return to dictatorship in Russia would quickly undermine all of these achievements.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>Thanks to some dogged diplomacy and a little skillful spin, two once implacable foes this week achieved a surprising, if temporary, rapprochement.</p> <p>No, not Russia and the United States, although it has been a pretty good week for those former adversaries too, and we'll get to that in a moment. I mean the Bush Pentagon and the Bush State Department. For followers of the engrossing battle between the treaty-loathing, gloom-mongering go-it-aloners who march with Donald Rumsfeld and the alliance-friendly, deal-cutting pragmatists with Colin Powell, this was a week when creative tension produced a constructive compromise. The agreement to cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals, along with other warm-up exercises for Mr. Bush's Moscow summit meeting next week, represents both the Pentagon view that we can act like masters of the universe and the State Department view that it's not always in our best interest to do so.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia said today that it would stop holding down its oil exports and let them rise to former levels over the next two months.</p> <p>Russia agreed to impose the export limits in December under pressure from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was trying to reverse a fall in oil prices by restricting supply. Russia initially promised to hold back exports for three months, and later extended the limits.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>With another oil shock looming thanks to Saddam Hussein's decision to suspend Iraq's oil exports and to the turmoil in Venezuela -- not to mention Saudi Arabia's recent, brief waving of ''the oil weapon'' -- the need to broaden the range of America's energy sources has become urgent.</p> <p>One underappreciated source is obvious: Russian oil. Russia is the world's single largest non-OPEC oil exporter, with 10 percent of currently known oil reserves and 9 percent of world output. Yet Russia's irregular, ''spot market'' deliveries to the United States are a fraction of 1 percent of American imports. By contrast, Iraq's share of American imports last year was 7 percent; between them, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iraq, OPEC members all, accounted for 34 percent.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Bush arrived here tonight for a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, greeted by a brass band, a parade of flag-carrying, arm-swinging soldiers and a rebuke over remarks he made earlier today about Russian aid to Iran's nuclear programs.</p> <p>It was a washboard start to a three-day visit that both sides have assiduously cast as a final elegy to the cold war, despite some clear differences over weapons proliferation and other issues that are cast as the foundation of a new friendship.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'finances']	<p>With President Bush barely a day away from Moscow, it began to appear today that he would not be bringing with him economic proposals to transform his first Kremlin meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin into anything more than a funeral service for the cold war.</p> <p>In Moscow, that was a clear disappointment for those who have held out hope that Mr. Bush might use such proposals to signal that talk of a new Russian-American alliance will yield tangible riches soon.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The Kremlin and the White House are portraying the summit meeting that begins here on Friday as the start of a beautiful friendship, the last shovelful of earth on the grave of superpower rivalry and cold war.</p> <p>So perhaps it should not be regarded as an omen that they cannot agree on what to call the treaty that is its crowning achievement.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign investments', 'television', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Thirteen days after Sept. 11 Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, met with 21 leaders from the Duma and the Presidium of the State Council to determine Russia's response to America's war on terror.</p> <p>''One of the participants advocated support for the Taliban,'' reports Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the democratic reform party, who was present, ''while 18 participants proposed that Russia remain neutral in the fight between America and the terrorists. Only two said that Russia should participate in the antiterrorist coalition.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>NATO formally welcomed Russia today as a participant  but not a full-fledged member -- in the organization created 53 years ago to contain Soviet power and expansion. The agreement signed here today at an extraordinary meeting of the leaders of NATO's 19 member nations marked what the Bush administration hopes is another major step in its effort to lock in Moscow's shift toward the West.</p> <p>The accord, a capstone to President Bush's six-day tour of Europe and Russia, will for the first time give Moscow a role from the outset in NATO discussions about a fixed variety of topics, including nonproliferation, crisis management, missile defense and counterterrorism.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>One factor in Russia's transition from dictatorship to democracy has been the capacity of its recent leaders to break with their own pasts. Once Mikhail Gorbachev made it to the top of the Soviet system, he moved to repudiate its reliance on lies and brute force, setting the stage for the end of the empire and of the cold war. Boris Yeltsin, who rose to the Politburo by carrying out its orders, spent his presidency doing battle against the remnants of the Communist Party. Vladimir Putin, a former K.G.B. officer who almost everyone believed would be hopelessly out of his depth as Mr. Yeltsin's successor, has remained popular at home while accelerating Russia's alignment with the West.</p> <p>And then there are the also-rans. One of those, Aleksandr Lebed, died at the age of 52 in a helicopter accident on April 28 in Siberia. He was a paratroop general right out of a recruiting poster. Barrel-chested and steely-eyed, with a basso profundo voice, he had achieved prominence commanding a Russian division that stayed behind in the former Soviet republic of Moldova after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That background made him appealing to nationalists who hoped for a return to authoritarianism at home and for Moscow's domination of neighboring states.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The seals of approval are coming thick and fast for President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia these days.</p> <p>Today, the European Union said it would recognize Russia as a market economy, an upgrading of its status under the union's trade regulations and a designation that Moscow had sought for years. In a statement, Romano Prodi, president of the union's executive body, the European Commission, called it ''fit and proper'' that the 15-nation union ''reward the considerable efforts'' Russia has made to remake its economy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>India decisively rejected a Russian diplomatic effort this evening to defuse a nuclear-armed standoff with Pakistan, saying that it would neither negotiate nor rein in a powerful military buildup until Pakistan halts a flow of armed guerrillas into Kashmir.</p> <p>It was a marked setback for international efforts to push the two nations away from the brink of a conflict over the Himalayan region claimed by both countries. The conflict could involve a million soldiers massed on the border and, in the worst case, millions of casualties.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Japan ratified an international accord on limiting emissions of heat-trapping gasses today, ending more than six months of internal debate, and said it would lobby the United States and other large polluters to do the same.</p> <p>Japan's ratification of the agreement, despite the opposition of many major industries, was an important step forward for the accord, known as the Kyoto Protocol on global warming.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Security strategy is now becoming globalized, in much the way the world's economy has become globalized. Ever since economies changed from being dependent upon land to being predicated on knowledge and information, the world's political borders have been blurred.</p> <p>Similarly, issues of security are shifting from a world in which nations face certain enemies to one in which threats are of a global nature. From the moment that ballistic missile systems were introduced, ballistic range became a strategic factor no less important than territorial depth.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biographical information']	<p>In a closed chamber, inside a hulking concrete courthouse in northeast Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia is settling a score from its Soviet past.</p> <p>Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general now living in the United States, stands charged -- in absentia -- with treason, evidently accused of divulging state secrets in his autobiography and, perhaps more significant, in his public testimony at the trial of an American Army reservist who was convicted of espionage in Florida last year.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>The elders danced in their fraying turbans as the opposition party's candidate for president campaigned across the swirling sands of the Sahel. On Election Day, the old men and other opposition supporters turned out by the thousands to vote for change in one of the poorest countries in the world.</p> <p>What happened in the election here in West Africa early in May made few headlines in the West. The army did not send troops into the shabby cities nor did tanks roll through windswept villages when the ruling party lost the presidency after 10 years in power.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>President Bush told his key allies today that the United States would cut off aid to the Palestinians if they failed to embrace the kind of changes he demanded on Monday.</p> <p>Stepping up his pressure for the removal of Yasir Arafat, he warned that ''we won't be putting money into a society'' dominated by corrupt leadership that helps to finance terrorists.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>Oleg D. Kalugin, a retired K.G.B. general who became a vociferous critic of the post-Soviet Russian governments, was convicted of treason in absentia today and sentenced to 15 years in prison for disclosing state secrets to the United States.</p> <p>The verdict and sentence are purely symbolic since Mr. Kalugin, who now lives and works near Washington, repeatedly rebuffed subpoenas to return to Moscow to defend himself. Today, Mr. Kalugin, a permanent resident of the United States, vowed never to return.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>One day after the United States formally abandoned the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, Russia responded in curt kind today, saying it was no longer bound by the 1993 accord known as Start II that outlawed multiple-warhead missiles and other especially destabilizing weapons in the two nations' strategic arsenals.</p> <p>Russia's action was the sort of statement that would have induced global seizures a decade ago. This time some experts called it a political gesture, signaling displeasure but little else in a world remade by forces unleashed after the Soviet Union's collapse.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>THE RUSSIA HAND  A Memoir of Presidential Diplomacy  By Strobe Talbott  Illustrated. 478 pages. Random House. $29.95.</p> <p>From the time he studied Russian at boarding school, Strobe Talbott arranged himself to be a specialist. He majored in Russian at Yale, wrote an Oxford thesis on the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, joined the Moscow bureau of Time magazine and then, as that magazine's foreign-policy writer in Washington, took a particular interest in United States-Soviet affairs.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'ethics']	<p>A decade after it began its spasmodic transition to capitalism, the Russian government is moving to dismantle one of the lasting legacies of the Stalinist era: the collectivization of the nation's farmlands.</p> <p>Urged by President Vladimir V. Putin, the lower house of Parliament, the Duma, passed a preliminary bill last month intended to create a legal system to buy and sell Russia's vast agricultural lands for the first time since the country's farms were nationalized in 1917.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>Anatoly Bykov, one of Russia's most infamous mobsters, who has been sought for years by the authorities here, was sentenced to jail by a Moscow court today -- and then promptly set free.</p> <p>It appeared to be an ignominious end, or at least pause, in an organized-crime case that some call a litmus test of Russia's criminal justice system, and others have called a travesty of that same system.</p>
['religion and churches', 'bombs and explosives', 'biographical information']	<p>The sign was the size of a large poster, pounded into a green roadside about 20 miles southwest of here. It stated its ugly message in thick, block letters: ''Death to Yids.''</p> <p>Although commuters streamed past it for a day, it was Tatyana Sapunova, a 27-year-old Muscovite, who stopped her tiny car to tear it down. But when she gave it a tug, it exploded, ripping wounds in her legs, hands and face.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia made a little history when they signed the Treaty of Moscow to cut the nuclear arsenals of both nations. Yet the principles they agreed on were little different from what Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin had agreed on countless times in the past: nuclear arms reductions, cooperation between Russia and NATO, solidarity against 21st century threats, increased trade and investment, and so on. What the new leaders add is the political strength and authority to make these ideas real. Seventy-percent approval ratings have their uses.</p> <p>Now Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin have to turn to problems on which their predecessors could not agree. Iran and Iraq top the list. Mr. Putin is politically stronger than Mr. Yeltsin ever was, and he may be more willing to accommodate the United States on these issues, too. But it won't be easy. Organized Russian trade and economic interests -- as powerful a force in Russian policy today as ideology was in the past -- stand in his way.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>As senior American officials prepared to begin a round of arm-twisting in Pakistan and India, ambassadors of those two countries indicated little flexibility today toward ending the standoff in Kashmir.</p> <p>India's ambassador, Lalit Mansingh, said time was running out on diplomacy, a barely veiled threat that military action could follow if Pakistan does not meet India's demands to prevent cross-border attacks by militants in the disputed Kashmir region.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>After months of negotiations, Japan, Canada and the European members of the Group of 8 agreed at the summit meeting today to spend $10 billion over the next decade to help Russia and other former Soviet states dispose of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, ending a long argument over how closely those countries could monitor the work.</p> <p>The figure will roughly match what the United States spends on similar programs, including the Congressional program to secure and dismantle nuclear weapons and keep former nuclear scientists employed.</p>
['foreign aid', 'economic conditions and trends', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush and leaders of the major industrial countries ended their meeting today by committing billions of dollars in aid to African nations that successfully reform their economies and governments. But they offered only the vaguest assurances that they would dismantle the huge subsidies for their own farmers, which African leaders bitterly complain have undercut the ability of the poorest nations to compete in world markets.</p> <p>The agreement today, announced when the leaders of South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Senegal arrived for its formal adoption, might eventually provide more than $6 billion in yearly aid starting in 2006. But the program requires recipients to implement a wide range of reforms, in areas from government to education.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'demonstrations and riots', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia's lower house of Parliament today approved a bill to create a legal system for the purchase and sale of farmland for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. But the measure, which requires one more vote before it goes to the upper house, passed only after the government agreed to a late amendment prohibiting foreigners to own agricultural property.</p> <p>Earlier this week, President Vladimir V. Putin played down fears that foreign companies would buy up Russian land. But his legislative allies agreed to the ban on foreign ownership on the eve of today's votes in what appeared to be an effort to mollify fears.</p>
['biographical information']	<p>It might be an exaggeration to suggest that a cult of personality has coalesced around President Vladimir V. Putin, and he himself rebutted the idea today. But he has unquestionably become a master of his own image and the most dominant political voice in Russia.</p> <p>Mr. Putin appeared before a battery of television cameras and some 700 journalists in the hall in the Kremlin where the Supreme Soviet once deliberated, and for more than two hours fielded questions with the bookish command of detail that Bill Clinton once displayed and that George W. Bush rarely does.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush has directed his top national security aides to make a doctrine of pre-emptive action against states and terrorist groups trying to develop weapons of mass destruction into the foundation of a new national security strategy, according to senior administration officials drafting the document.</p> <p>Iraq is clearly first on the target list for such action, and already the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department have stepped up efforts to unseat Saddam Hussein in a last effort to avoid the necessity of a full-scale invasion.</p>
['medicine and health', 'atomic energy', 'bombs and explosives', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism']	<p>The International Atomic Energy Agency said today that virtually any country in the world had the radioactive materials needed to build a ''dirty bomb,'' and that more than 100 of these countries had inadequate controls to prevent their theft.</p> <p>The agency, an arm of the United Nations, said in a news release issued at its headquarters in Vienna that ''orphaned'' radioactive materials -- those outside regulatory control -- were a ''widespread phenomenon'' in the former Soviet Union.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>When the Antiballistic Missile Treaty was signed in 1972, Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev sat side-by-side in Moscow, in an elaborate ceremony meant to show that even cold war enemies could come to an agreement.</p> <p>When it died today at age 30 years and 18 days, the White House issued a four-paragraph statement and the Kremlin shrugged, the absence of ceremony meant to show that the American-Russian partnership could survive a disagreement.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'religion and churches', 'international trade and world market', 'immigration and refugees', 'law and legislation', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>President Bush told President Vladimir V. Putin by telephone today that the United States would begin regarding Russia as a market economy, a change in semantics that has significant practical consequences for Russian-American trade.</p> <p>The move, after a similar step last week by the European Union, addresses one of Moscow's main complaints about the West, that Russia's Communist past is used as an excuse to treat it unfairly in trade disputes.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>In a brazen daytime ambush today, Palestinians in Israeli Army uniforms set off a roadside bomb near a bus approaching this Jewish settlement, then hurled grenades and raked the vehicle with gunfire, killing seven people and wounding 17 before escaping.</p> <p>An 11-month-old baby, her father and grandmother were among the dead, hospital officials said.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>The administration and its major Middle East mediating partners agreed yesterday on the broad goal of creating a Palestinian state within three years, but differed sharply on almost everything else, including the future role of Yasir Arafat and the correct degree of emphasis on security as a condition for resuming peace talks with Israel.</p> <p>In a daylong series of meetings in New York, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and top envoys from the United Nations, the European Union and Russia discussed how to create fresh momentum for political talks in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The group, which styles itself the Quartet, said in a statement that it remained committed to ''promote a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'international trade and world market']	<p>This small wedge of territory, part of Russia but separate from it, has haltingly begun to open up after spending decades as one of the Soviet Union's secret military zones, closed to the world. Now the greatest fear for Kaliningrad's residents is that it is about to close again.</p> <p>The enclave's two neighbors, Poland and Lithuania, plan to erect strict new barriers on their porous borders, imposing new visa and customs controls, as part of their efforts to join the European Union in 2004.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Senators from both parties raised sharp questions today about the effectiveness of the recent Treaty of Moscow, which commits the United States and Russia to deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals over the coming decade but offers no guidelines for achieving the cuts or means of making sure that they have been made.</p> <p>Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell parried questions about why the agreement lacked procedures for verifying reductions and did not require the destruction of excess warheads. He also urged the senators not to try to add conditions to the treaty.</p>
['terrorism', 'medicine and health', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The federal government will soon vaccinate roughly a half-million health care and emergency workers against smallpox as a precaution against a bioterrorist attack, federal officials said. The government is also laying the groundwork to carry out mass vaccinations of the public -- a policy abandoned 30 years ago -- if there is a large outbreak.</p> <p>Until last month, officials had said they would soon vaccinate a few thousand health workers and would respond to any smallpox attack with limited vaccinations of the public. Since 1983, only 11,000 Americans who work with the virus and its related diseases have received a vaccination, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'accidents and safety']	<p>Switzerland, a country long believed to work with the precision of one of its renowned watches, is wondering whatever happened to the image of flawless efficiency it once enjoyed.</p> <p>The glitches and breakdowns in Switzerland's air traffic control system that contributed to the recent midair collision in which 71 people died have compounded a sense of national shame and embarrassment linked to several recent incidents.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>In this sleek cafe, with exposed-brick, track lighting and a chrome-rimmed bar, you can dine on fettuccini alfredo with salmon, sautéed mushrooms, and Black Forest cake. Not exactly typical fare for this bedraggled Far East city of drab, cabbage-scented cafeterias.</p> <p>Even more surprising, perhaps, are the cafe's owners -- a scrap metal dealer with scarred knuckles and a shady past, and a 25-year-old whose father is a government bigwig.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'crime and criminals', 'law and legislation']	<p>For 13 years, Pavel P. Khovrachyov has been a criminal prosecutor, investigating and convicting people for crimes large and small. Everything about his job is about to change.</p> <p>''It will be more complicated to prove someone's guilty,'' he said, somewhat wistfully, during a break in an assault trial in this town north of Moscow.</p>
['atomic energy']	<p>The Russian government, brushing aside the Bush administration's concerns, indicated today that it planned to continue building new nuclear reactors in Iran like one that American officials have repeatedly warned could be used to develop nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Russia's assistance in building a nuclear plant in the Iranian city of Bushehr, near the Persian Gulf, has been a nagging irritant in relations with the United States for years. It produced the sourest note in otherwise friendly meetings between President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin here in May.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'crime and criminals', 'olympic games', 'ethics']	<p>A Russian accused of being in organized crime was arrested in Italy yesterday on an American complaint that he conspired to fix the pairs figure skating and ice dancing competitions at the recent Salt Lake Winter Olympics, which were dominated by the sport's judging scandals.</p> <p>The Russian, Alimzhan Tokhtakhounov, who was arrested by the Italian authorities at his resort home in Forte dei Marmi, appeared to have a singular motivation for rigging the competitions: getting a visa to return to France, where he once lived.</p>
['medicine and health', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>The world's leading psychiatric association voted today to send a delegation of experts to China to look into charges that Chinese psychiatric hospitals are being used to silence political and religious dissidents.</p> <p>Officials of the World Psychiatric Association, which is meeting in Yokohama, Japan, said Chinese health officials had been cooperative so far. A preliminary fact-gathering delegation is to travel to China next spring.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's war in Chechnya is spilling into the steep green gorges and snow-flecked mountains across its border with Georgia, worsening already tense relations between the two countries.</p> <p>Russian fighter jets and helicopters have repeatedly crossed into Georgian territory in recent weeks, evidently in pursuit of Chechen fighters, according to senior Georgian and European officials. At least twice this month -- on Aug. 3 and Aug. 5 -- Russian aircraft bombed a gorge in Georgia less than two miles from the remote border outpost here in Girevi, Georgian officials said.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>American anger over Russia's construction of a nuclear power plant in Iran and its plans to build as many as five more soured two days of talks between senior American and Russian officials that were intended to highlight new cooperation in securing the world's energy supply.</p> <p>Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said today that Iran was ''aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons'' and that Russia's construction of a civilian nuclear plant at Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf, supported Iran's efforts.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>International arms sales to the developing world tumbled steeply last year, reaching the lowest level in eight years, as those nations curtailed weapons purchases because of the global economic downturn, according to a new Congressional study.</p> <p>Global arms sales overall, including weapons deals in developed and developing nations, also dropped significantly last year, to the lowest total since 1997, the report said.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>More than 100 pounds of nuclear material considered at risk of being stolen or sold for use in producing nuclear weapons was secretly flown today from Serbia to Russia, where it will be processed for use in a commercial power plant, United States officials said.</p> <p>The operation, which was financed by the United States and a private foundation founded by Ted Turner, involved 1,200 Serbian soldiers and scores of international observers, They helped transport more than 5,000 rods of highly enriched uranium from a research reactor near Belgrade to Russia under cloak of night.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Americans like to call their politics a blood sport. They should come to Moscow, where to a worrisome degree that is more than just a metaphor.</p> <p>If assassins do not prey on members of Parliament every day -- once or twice a year seems more the norm -- sudden death is nevertheless a grim fact of life for elected officials and political appointees.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia, the second-largest oil exporter, agreed today to help OPEC maintain oil prices but offered no new promises to reduce its exports.</p> <p>The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Álvaro Silva Calderón, on a one-day visit to Moscow, met today with the Russian energy minister, Igor K. Yusufov.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia has refused to reissue visas for 30 Peace Corps volunteers, most of whom were working as English teachers in regional Russian schools, and Russian educators said today that they were disappointed by the decision.</p> <p>It was the second time Russia had forced American volunteers to leave in the middle of their two-year teaching commitments. Last year, 10 volunteers were refused visa renewals.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'banks and banking']	<p>Deep in the pine forest of the Russian north, a battle is being fought over the shape of a Russian economy increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few tycoons.</p> <p>In an action giving new meaning to the concept of a hostile takeover, corporate raiders employed by one of Russia's most powerful businessmen have put a large pulp and paper mill -- quite literally -- under siege. A brigade of the tycoon's private security guards lies in wait, ready to take the mill, 575 miles northeast of Moscow.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'accidents and safety', 'ethics', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said today that 114 of 147 passengers on a military helicopter that crashed in a Chechnya minefield on Monday were killed, as the incident placed political pressure on President Vladimir V. Putin, who has faced steady criticism over the decline of the Russian armed forces.</p> <p>The cause of the crash remained unclear, with some officials saying the helicopter appeared to have been shot down by a portable surface-to-air missile. The conflicting accounts of what happened, along with reports of poor maintenance, encouraged comparison with the sinking two years ago of the submarine Kursk.</p>
['terrorism', 'books and literature', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Aleksandr Prokhanov edits an anti-Semitic, anti-Western, anticapitalist newspaper called Zavtra. He was visited by the Klansman David Duke, told the crowd at this year's Communist Party May Day rally that a new red revolution was about to sweep Russia and has defended a neo-fascist leader accused of plotting terrorist acts.</p> <p>But in recent months many Moscow intellectuals and mainstream readers have embraced his latest novel, which satirizes many of Russia's major figures of the last decade and accuses the government of a role in the apartment bombings that rocked the city in 1999 and led to the current war in Chechnya.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>THE political career of Andrei Y. Brezhnev, grandson of the late Soviet Communist leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, could hardly be called auspicious thus far.</p> <p>The younger Brezhnev ran for Parliament in 1999 and won 2 percent of the vote. He tried to run for governor of the Urals region of Sverdlovsk that year but was thrown off the ballot. He made it onto the ballot for governor in Tula, south of Moscow, last year, but captured 1 percent, losing to Vasily A. Starodubtsev, one of the leaders of the August 1991 coup that hastened the end of the Soviet Union.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'russia-international relations-us', 'finances']	<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld issued a stern warning to Moscow today, saying that expanding trade with Iraq would brand Russia a friend of terrorist states and frighten foreign investors away from its capital-starved economy.</p> <p>''To the extent that Russia decides that it wants to parade its relationships with countries like Iraq and Libya and Syria and Cuba and North Korea, it sends a signal out across the globe that that is what Russia thinks is a good thing to do, to deal with the terrorist states,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'public opinion', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Yevgeny Ruchichnikov had just dozed off on Tuesday night when a powerful explosion tossed him out of bed in his first-floor apartment on Akademika Korolyova Street.</p> <p>He pushed his family through falling rubble to safety on the street. Not once, he said, did he smell gas.</p>
['medicine and health', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush signed a temporary waiver on Wednesday that permits millions of dollars to be released to programs aimed at reducing the threat posed by Russian nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.</p> <p>The waiver came as Russian scientists disclosed new information about a suspicious outbreak of smallpox in 1971 that some scientists say was caused by a Soviet biological weapons test on an island in the Aral Sea. At a pox virus conference this week in Lyon, France, Russian scientists said they had destroyed some tissue samples and biological material that the United States had hoped might shed light on the outbreak, which killed two children and a young woman before it was contained.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>Russia, under pressure from the Bush administration, indicated today for the first time that it was prepared to reconsider plans to continue building nuclear reactors in Iran that American officials fear could be used in a covert program to build nuclear weapons.</p> <p>After a third day of meetings here in Moscow with American officials, the minister of Russia's nuclear energy agency, Aleksandr Y. Rumyantsev, said in a statement that Russia would take into account ''political factors'' before deepening its assistance to Iran, according to a statement released by his ministry.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Administration officials said today that they were encouraged by a telephone conversation that President Bush had with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seeking support for American action against Saddam Hussein, and that differences between the governments over Iraq were exaggerated.</p> <p>The Kremlin countered that Mr. Putin stood firm against a move on Iraq and that his priority was still to send United Nations arms inspectors back to Baghdad, which the Bush administration's most hawkish members consider a waste of time.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush yesterday offered an eloquent, forceful and overdue call for the U.N. to hold Saddam Hussein accountable.</p> <p>Just one problem: He cited no evidence of any immediate threat, no reason that invading Iraq is any more urgent today than it was in, say, 2000, when Mr. Bush as a candidate huffed and puffed about Saddam but never shared with voters any plans for an invasion.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'crime and criminals', 'russia-international relations-us', 'international trade and world market', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>The Bush administration imposed penalties today on three Russian military contractors that sold weapons to countries that the State Department says support terrorism.</p> <p>The companies, all government owned, are said to have sold conventional military equipment like missiles and rocket-fired grenades to Libya, Sudan and Syria, officials said. The penalties mean that the companies will not be able to do business with the United States government, sell their equipment here or buy certain equipment and services from American businesses.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Construction formally began today on a new pipeline to carry oil from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, bypassing Russia and Iran.</p> <p>Huge reserves of oil and gas are believed to be recoverable in the Caspian basin, but exploitation of them has been limited in part by the difficult logistics and the difficult politics of transporting the output to Western markets. The new pipeline, to be built and operated by a consortium led by BP, is expected to begin carrying 375,000 barrels of oil a day by early 2005 and 1 million barrels a day by 2007.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States made rapid headway today toward persuading the Security Council to confront Iraq, as Russia hardened its position against Baghdad and the European Union supported a new resolution to force the return of weapons inspectors.</p> <p>One day after President Bush told the General Assembly to enforce the United Nations resolutions on Iraq, Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, warned that Baghdad would face ''consequences'' for failing to cooperate with Security Council resolutions.</p>
['terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Georgia took several measures today in an attempt to defuse tensions with Russia, which had threatened military action against Chechen fighters on Georgian territory.</p> <p>The Georgian government announced that it had bolstered security on its border with Chechnya, arrested two armed insurgents and invited international observers to monitor its efforts to crack down on terrorism.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush called the leaders of Russia, China and France today to seek their support as he tried to build an international coalition against Saddam Hussein, but he appeared, in his initial approaches, to have made little headway in convincing them that the need for action was urgent.</p> <p>Soon after his talk with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, the Kremlin spokesman said Mr. Putin had expressed ''serious doubts that there are grounds for the use of force in connection with Iraq from the standpoint of international law or from a political standpoint.''</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri alHadithi, stopped here briefly today, seeking renewed support from a generally sympathetic Kremlin against the threat of an American effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power. He got it, but not as unambiguously as he might have liked.</p> <p>After meeting with Mr. Sabri al-Hadithi, the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, at a news conference with the Iraqi, repeated the Kremlin's position that military action against Iraq ''would seriously undermine the already difficult situation in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East'' and make prospects for a permanent settlement of the region's problems even more remote.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'terrorism', 'energy and power']	<p>Alarmed by violence and political volatility in the Middle East, China's leaders are aggressively developing alternatives to oil from the region. But a booming economy and rising sales of cars may propel China, however reluctantly, into the same sticky embrace with Mideast oil producers that the United States, Japan and many other countries have accepted.</p> <p>China's transformation from a net exporter of oil as recently as 1993 to a big oil importer has made it more attuned to events in the Middle East. Even as the Bush administration steps up threats to attack Iraq, Baghdad has been wooing the Chinese. Iraq's foreign minister, Naji Sabri, has just met here with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and other high-ranking officials, and the Chinese reiterated their opposition to the use or threat of force against Iraq.</p>
['elections', 'biographical information']	<p>Candidates backed by two powerful Russian business groups won the first round in an election today to replace Aleksandr I. Lebed as governor of this vast Siberian region.</p> <p>Aleksandr V. Uss, 54, the leader of the local Parliament who is backed by a large aluminum conglomerate, and Aleksandr G. Khloponin, 37, the former executive of a large metals producer and the governor of a nearby region, will face off in two weeks to determine the winner. The election was set after Mr. Lebed, an outspoken former general, died in a helicopter crash in April.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Bush administration has drafted a stringent plan for arms inspections that provides for unrestricted access to all sites in Iraq, including Saddam Hussein's presidential compounds and palaces, and authorizes the use of military force if Baghdad interferes, according to European and American officials.</p> <p>The essence of the plan, which American and British officials are presenting to France, Russia and China, the other veto-bearing members of the United Nations Security Council, is to declare that Iraq is already violating its obligations to the United Nations and to put the onus on Saddam Hussein to comply.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'energy and power', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Energy executives and government officials from Russia and the United States will meet in Houston next week to discuss energy cooperation at a time when concerns over the safety of world oil supplies have been heightened by the Bush administration's push for action against Iraq.</p> <p>The conference is expected to include a who's who of leaders of the Russian oil industry as well as executives from American energy companies. The secretary of commerce, Donald L. Evans, and the secretary of the Treasury, Paul H. O'Neill, are also scheduled to take part.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Secretary General Kofi Annan smiled broadly when he stepped to the microphones on Monday afternoon to report the breakthrough: Iraq would allow United Nations weapons inspectors to return ''without conditions.'' But his news made United States officials furious.</p> <p>A few blocks away in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell interrupted a meeting with the foreign minister of Egypt to read the Iraqi offer, which was drafted with Mr. Annan's advice and brokered with his blessing to avert war. In an instant, Iraq's move put the brakes on the diplomatic charge that President Bush had started with a powerful speech just four days earlier, calling on the United Nations to hold President Saddam Hussein accountable for defying its resolutions.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'books and literature', 'biographical information']	<p>Russians got a glimpse of how the other side lives and thinks Thursday evening at the premiere of ''Oligarch,'' a film chronicling the wild early years of Russian capitalism.</p> <p>Film critics in stylish square-rimmed glasses, students, government officials, dark-suited bankers, and even retirees all pressed into the Pushkin movie theater to watch the loosely fictionalized story of one of the most controversial figures in the country's recent history -- the business tycoon Boris A. Berezovsky.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'biographical information']	<p>One of President Vladimir V. Putin's top national security aides suffered head and chest injuries in a deadly auto accident today on a rain-slicked road in Russia's Far East, and was to be flown to Moscow for further treatment, Russian television and news services reported.</p> <p>The aide, Vladimir Rushailo, is secretary of the Kremlin's national security council, the agency that drafts long-range plans for addressing both internal and foreign threats to Russia's stability. Mr. Rushailo, 49, was injured when a sport-utility vehicle crossed the center line and struck his motorcade near the town of Petropavlovsk, on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Six people, including the driver of the sport-utility vehicle, were killed in the collision; another eight, including Mr. Rushailo and the governor of Kamchatka, Mikhail Mashkovtsev, have been hospitalized.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'public opinion', 'biographical information']	<p>It was a defining symbol of the collapse of the Soviet Union: on the night of Aug. 22, 1991, five cranes pulled down the towering bronze statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Soviet secret police, as thousands of Muscovites cheered with the delirium of defiance and newly found freedoms.</p> <p>Now, in what may become a defining symbol of today's Russia, a new campaign is under way to put Dzerzhinsky back on his central pedestal -- a traffic island in Lubyanka Square in front of the headquarters of the former K.G.B. and its successor, the Federal Security Services.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>After a week of intensive negotiations, diplomats here at the World Summit on Sustainable Development arrived at a plan early this morning that is intended to reduce poverty and preserve the earth's natural resources.</p> <p>The breakthrough came after diplomats worked late into the night on Tuesday to resolve a dispute over language in the conference's plan on health care for women.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>On Friday, the Bush administration will publish its first comprehensive rationale for shifting American military strategy toward pre-emptive action against hostile states and terrorist groups developing weapons of mass destruction. The strategy document will also state, for the first time, that the United States will never allow its military supremacy to be challenged the way it was during the cold war.</p> <p>In the 33-page document, Mr. Bush also seeks to answer the critics of growing American muscle-flexing by insisting that the United States will exploit its military and economic power to encourage ''free and open societies,'' rather than seek ''unilateral advantage.'' It calls this union of values and national interests ''a distinctly American internationalism.'' [Excerpts, Page A14.]</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Just five days ago, President Bush's strong appeal to the United Nations for collective action on Iraq allayed world suspicion that the United States was a go-it-alone superpower bent on war and forged a broad consensus that Iraq must give up any weapons of mass destruction or face the consequences.</p> <p>Now Iraq's sudden offer to readmit international weapons inspectors has turned the world again, and left Mr. Bush scrambling with mixed success to press his case for disarming Iraq and dislodging Saddam Hussein as the next milestone in his campaign against terrorism.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States insisted here today on keeping up the pressure on Iraq with a tough new Security Council resolution, while Russia, France, China and the Arab nations said Iraq's decision to allow the return of international weapons inspectors was enough to hold off stronger action for the time being.</p> <p>The very visible rift here exposed core differences between the United States and other major countries at the United Nations, which contended that the weapons inspectors should be given time to determine whether Iraq is producing prohibited weapons. The Bush administration had little faith that inspections would ensure Iraq's disarmament and pressed ahead for a Security Council measure that could authorize an eventual military attack against the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A flurry of Russian overtures to Iraq, Iran and North Korea  nations the United States calls an ''axis of evil'' -- is exposing strains in the newly forged relationship between Presidents Bush and Vladimir V. Putin, American and Russian officials say.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Putin's government has conspicuously pursued a range of economic and diplomatic accords with all three countries -- from proposals to drill for oil in Iraq and build nuclear reactors in Iran to a warm meeting between Mr. Putin and North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, in Vladivostok on Aug. 23.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush said today that he would seek approval from Congress before taking action against Iraq, as the White House opened a campaign to persuade lawmakers, reluctant allies and the public that Saddam Hussein poses a grave danger to the United States and the world.</p> <p>Leaders of the House and Senate who were briefed on the president's position today said they were pleased to be consulted, but that neither the president nor his Defense Secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, had presented any new evidence that the threat from Mr. Hussein was imminent. After Mr. Bush met this morning at the White House with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders, Mr. Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to senators in a closed meeting on Capitol Hill.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush wisely warns of the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iraq, but he remains unevenly engaged in other efforts that would stem the spread of nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein's nuclear potential has been repeatedly cited by the administration as the one unassailable reason why the American people should support an invasion of Iraq. Yet ours is a dangerous stance: If we remove the threat of Saddam Hussein while leaving the rest of our nonproliferation policy unchanged, we will achieve only a marginal improvement in our security against nuclear terror. To make an invasion of Iraq worthwhile, a new investment in nuclear security is urgently needed.</p> <p>Leading experts and many in the intelligence community agree that Saddam Hussein still needs several years to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. Thus, when Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Iraq could quickly obtain nuclear weapons, he could only have been referring to one thing: Iraq might acquire the crucial fissile material it needs abroad, through theft or on the black market.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Iraq's rejection of any new United Nations resolution that toughens the terms of disarmament appeared calculated to widen the gap dividing the United States and Britain from the other big powers at the United Nations as they were struggling to find a common approach to confront Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>But if it stands as Iraq's last word, this refusal could also mark the beginning of the transition from diplomacy to war in the Persian Gulf, as President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair were already wheeling their military forces to higher states of readiness.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>They have already counted the four residents in the village of Pyalitsy on the Kola Peninsula above the Arctic Circle and confirmed the population of a hamlet called Ustye Vorzugi: one. In the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area in Siberia, they needed helicopters to track down families gathering cranberries in the bogs.</p> <p>In some of the most remote hamlets and villages on earth, across a vast continent stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, Russia has begun the monumental task of conducting a census.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'law and legislation', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Iraq today rejected a proposal by the United States and Britain for a Security Council resolution imposing tough weapons inspections, saying that it would not accept any new rules for the work of United Nations inspectors.</p> <p>Diplomats from Washington and London shuttled to Moscow and Beijing today after consulting in Paris, trying to overcome strong objections to the draft resolution among the other three permanent, veto-bearing members of the Security Council. The proposal gives Iraq 30 days to make full disclosure of its weapons of mass destruction and provides for unfettered inspections, authorizing a military attack if Baghdad does not comply.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'accidents and safety', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Roxana Pourshapour was on a flight from Shiraz to Tehran last month when she smelled something burning. Then the oxygen masks dropped.</p> <p>''Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm and use the oxygen masks only if you have to,'' the pilot said over the loudspeaker, without further explanation. ''We are on our way back to Shiraz.''</p>
['elections']	<p>Two enormous financial empires have thrown their might behind competing candidates in a closely fought election in the heart of Siberia that political analysts in Moscow say is basically a corporate battle.</p> <p>On the ground, however, the battle looks like something of a farce, with a variety of candidates who seem to be seeking something other than the governorship.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>A sniper hiding behind a billboard and armed with a revolver equipped with a silencer shot and killed one of Moscow's regional governors today just blocks from the Kremlin in one the most brazen in a string of assassinations in Russia over the past decade.</p> <p>The governor, Valentin Tsvetkov, represented Magadan, a Pacific Coast province known for its lucrative -- and, many say, corrupt -- gold-mining and fishing industries. Investigators and fellow politicians said they suspected Mr. Tsvetkov, who had a reputation as a reformer, had run afoul of criminal interests.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Dino Brugioni had spent decades poring over every detail from the spy plane photographs of Soviet missiles whose discovery here, 40 years ago this weekend, brought the superpowers to the brink of nuclear holocaust. But today the former Central Intelligence Agency officer learned a few things that had eluded even his careful eye, thanks to none other than Gen. Anatoly Gribkov, who was the Soviet officer who supervised the construction of missile bases in Cuba in 1962.</p> <p>More like old colleagues than former adversaries, the two men stood this morning in front of an abandoned bunker, discussing roads, cables and missile locations. Their exchanges contained more shop talk than sharp words.</p>
['books and literature', 'biographical information']	<p>Are the sins of the left commensurate with those of the right? Is it just to speak of Stalin's evil in the same breath as Hitler's? Have two gilded Englishmen -- author and polemicist, novelist and activist -- fallen terminally from each other's favor over these heady and tormented questions?</p> <p>Britain's intellectual heavyweights have woven a dispute of such imponderables, sublime and ridiculous. The disagreement is at once curiously English yet remote from a land whose political institutions draw no direct lineage from the extremes of Communism and fascism that fixated Continental Europe for much of the 20th century.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In a tense three-way contest in the Security Council, the United States pressed today for rapid approval of its tough draft resolution to disarm Iraq while France and Russia presented their own informal texts designed to moderate the threat of military attack.</p> <p>American diplomats, further stepping up the pressure on reluctant allies, put the Council on notice today that the United States might call for a vote on its draft at any time.</p>
['medicine and health', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Russia acknowledged today that it pumped an aerosol version of a powerful painkiller, Fentanyl, into a Moscow theater to end a hostage crisis last Saturday, breaking a four-day silence on the drug's identity that had drawn mounting criticism in the United States and Europe.</p> <p>Russia's health minister, Yuri L. Shevchenko, identified the gas. Meanwhile, the death toll of victims in the 57-hour hostage siege rose by 2 to 120. All but two of the victims apparently died from effects of the Fentanyl derivative.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The first round of Iraq negotiations including both permanent and rotating Security Council members ended today without threats from France, Russia or China to use their veto or moves to confront Washington with competing resolutions.</p> <p>But the 15 Council nations remained divided by as little, or as much, as two words: ''material breach.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia is biding its time over whether to support the Bush administration in seeking a new United Nations resolution on Iraq, with parliamentary leaders saying today that the decision hinged on economic interests, and with the Kremlin still declining to lay out its terms in public.</p> <p>Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a liberal leader who sees President Vladimir V. Putin regularly, said in an interview that he believed Mr. Putin would ultimately allow the American resolution to pass, but was waiting to see how the Americans planned to protect Russia's interests in Iraq after Saddam Hussein goes.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>Japan will stop financing two nuclear reactors in North Korea and suspend talks on normalizing relations if there is no progress on ending the North's clandestine nuclear weapons program, Japan's lead negotiator said today.</p> <p>''Of course the negotiations would halt,'' the official, Katsunari Suzuki, told Japanese reporters. If Japan determined that North Korea ''is carrying out nuclear development, then we must suspend at a minimum, and in certain cases, must think about terminating it,'' he added.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States presented a slightly revised draft resolution on Iraq to the four other permanent members of the Security Council today, but it did not reach agreement with France and Russia, diplomats said.</p> <p>The draft, presented by Ambassador John D. Negroponte, acknowledged that the Security Council could hold another round of debate after weapons inspectors returned to Iraq and issued a negative report. But Washington will not agree to any language that would block it from taking action on its own, American officials said.</p>
['terrorism', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>It had been quiet for hours when Lyudmila Fedyantseva noticed that a man in the theater of 763 hostages was on the verge of a breakdown.</p> <p>A smoker with a nervous nature, he was fidgeting more than usual. Suddenly, about 2:40 a.m., he leapt from his seat and, climbing on people's heads and the backs of seats, lunged toward the exit. Chechen gunmen shouted at him and lifted their weapons.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>This is how the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Vladimir I. Moltenskoi, sees life here.</p> <p>''I watched with pleasure how 217 schools began their new school year this year,'' he said in his heavily fortified headquarters near here, ''how the university works, institutes work, how people visit markets, move about the republic, even travel beyond the republic.''</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>As Russia defends its position during a two-day United Nations debate on Iraq, one thing will weigh on the minds of Russian diplomats: oil.</p> <p>Russian oil companies have extensive interests in Iraq that reach back to Soviet times, when the two countries were allied. Revenue from Russia's own oil production is crucial to the government's budget, making the country very sensitive to any sudden swings in world oil prices that might be touched off by military action.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>As the Bush administration lobbies Russia and other veto-bearing members of the Security Council to agree to a new resolution on Iraq, a delegation of Iraqi officials visited Moscow to appeal to business people and officials to resist the pressure.</p> <p>The six-member Iraqi delegation, which arrived in Moscow on Wednesday, included a deputy oil minister, deputy minister of industry and natural resources and the head of a state organization called the Society of Friendship, Peace and Solidarity With Foreign Countries.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>The tent camp at Aki-Yurt is not as squalid as some refugee camps around the world. The 2,700 Chechens there have electricity and gas and even men's and women's steam baths. The Danish Council for Refugees provides flour, oil, sugar and salt, much of it from the United States. An Austrian organization, Hilfswerk, built a wooden school last year for the camp's 415 children.</p> <p>Russia wants to shut it down anyway.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'energy and power', 'finances', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia got a new start last week on one of its boldest economic reforms in years: breaking up its vast electricity monopoly.</p> <p>But many questions remain about how the plan will be carried out, and investors and some lawmakers have warned that the process risks repeating the flaws and mistakes of privatization in Russia in the mid-1990's. That program was often manipulated by powerful insiders who stripped away valuable state assets and left outside shareholders with little or nothing. The Russian legal system is still trying to cope with the fallout.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>''They would drive them here and turn down this track,'' Aleksandra A. Reznikova said as she hiked into the woods deep within this military preserve northeast of St. Petersburg.</p> <p>''Then they would bring them here, to the trenches,'' she said, making her way through the birch trees and pines. ''Maybe soldiers dug them. Maybe they had to dig their own graves.''</p>
['public opinion', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>As Iraq confronts the possibility of a new war with the United States, its leaders appear to have concluded that they have one decisive advantage that they lacked during the countdown to the Persian Gulf war 12 years ago: this time, they seem convinced, the world is on their side and against the United States.</p> <p>''The world has abandoned America; it has become isolated,'' Saddam Hussein's No. 2 man, Izzat Ibrahim, boasted as he announced the result of this week's election: Iraqis, by official reckoning, had re-elected Saddam Hussein to his position of absolute power as president with 100 percent of the 11.4 million votes cast. Along with other leaders in Baghdad, Mr. Ibrahim accused the United States of warmongering, threatening not only Iraq but the entire Middle East.</p>
['banks and banking', 'crime and criminals', 'finances']	<p>Russia was released today from an international blacklist of countries with inadequate monitoring of money laundering, in a move seen in part as a political gesture to President Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, an international agency of 31 member natons, including the United States, in a meeting today in Paris, removed Russia from its list of about a dozen countries most likely to be havens for criminals and tax dodgers.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin said today that Russia was prepared to support new United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq, but only to strengthen the work of inspectors searching for its weapons programs and not to authorize the use of military force.</p> <p>Making his most extensive remarks to date on the looming confrontation with Iraq, after meetings here with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Putin said the most urgent issue was how to return inspectors to Iraq to verify that country's compliance with its commitments to dismantle nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Following are excerpts from statements yesterday by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and by Israel and the Palestinians, on ''The Situation Between Iraq and Kuwait,'' as transcribed by The New York Times:</p> <p>Russia  Sergey V. Lavrov  Ambassador</p> <p>The issue is not how many resolutions or do we need any resolutions. That diverts attention from the crux of the matter. We believe that the crux of the matter is the following: If we're all sincerely interested in the non-renewal of W.M.D. [weapons of mass destruction] programs in Iraq, then what's the remaining issue? What do we expect? What are waiting for? The inspectors can travel tomorrow, as early as tomorrow. And Iraq knows that it must fully and scrupulously cooperate with the inspectors.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'crime and criminals', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>American intelligence officials have concluded that Pakistan, a vital ally since last year's terrorist attacks, was a major supplier of critical equipment for North Korea's newly revealed clandestine nuclear weapons program, current and former senior American officials said today.</p> <p>The equipment, which may include gas centrifuges used to create weapons-grade uranium, appears to have been part of a barter deal beginning in the late 1990's in which North Korea supplied Pakistan with missiles it could use to counter India's nuclear arsenal, the officials said.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'elections']	<p>Russian democracy appeared today to be stumbling after local authorities in two areas meddled with election results, causing a national scandal.</p> <p>Radio talk shows, television news programs and newspaper headlines were all buzzing with the news from Krasnoyarsk, the Siberian region where the local election commission on Sunday unexpectedly annulled the results of a recent gubernatorial election.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'public opinion', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The prime opinion-slinging show on Russian TV these days is called ''Svoboda Slova,'' ''Freedom of Speech.'' It's like ''Crossfire'' on steroids, with antagonists exchanging muscular polemics while a fever chart of audience opinion tells you who's winning the argument. The other day the subject was Iraq, and it was a depressing glimpse of how America looks these days from outside its sanctuary of self-absorption.</p> <p>One guest disputant on the Iraq side was Baghdad's ambassador to Moscow. He studied journalism in the Soviet Union, and it shows: he tried to change the subject to Hiroshima. Another was a leader of a sleazy, quasi-Fascist party in the Russian Parliament, who warned that after the power-drunk Americans devoured Iraq they would soon be nibbling at Russia's entrails. This was not a pair that radiated credibility.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The chief United Nations weapons inspector, Hans Blix, today endorsed the main demand of the United States that Iraq make a full declaration of its weapons programs before inspections resume.</p> <p>After an hourlong meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other officials, Mr. Blix said that there was ''very broad support'' in the Security Council for a new resolution setting tough terms for inspections. He also endorsed the threat of consequences if Iraq fails to disarm, saying, ''I think it is clear that there has to be constant pressure'' to make Baghdad comply.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>It was not the most dramatic symbol of the end of the cold war, but a momentous one nonetheless. In 1991, six days after the abortive putsch that signaled the end of the Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree allowing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast from Russia.</p> <p>Today President Vladimir V. Putin annulled the decree.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Georgia agreed today to extradite 5 of 13 Chechen fighters detained near the Russian border in August, bowing to pressure from President Vladimir V. Putin that Georgia do more to crack down on Chechens in Georgian territory or face pre-emptive strikes by Russian forces.</p> <p>The five fighters, who were not identified, were whisked from the main detention center in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, early this morning. A Russian airplane carrying intelligence and security officers landed in Georgia today and, after last-minute negotiations, flew the fighters tonight to Stavropol, a Russian republic not far from Chechnya.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States formally presented the full Security Council today with a draft resolution that includes a threat of military action against Iraq, sharply increasing the pressure on France, Russia and China to agree to a tough measure to force Baghdad to disarm.</p> <p>The administration's step followed six weeks of wrangling among the five veto-bearing members of the Council that did not yield agreement on linking a proposal for tough weapons inspections in Iraq with a threat of military force to back them up.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'russia-international relations-us', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin, echoing statements by President Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, said today that Russia was prepared to strike at international terrorist groups in whatever country harbored them.</p> <p>Speaking in the anguished aftermath of the 57-hour siege of a Moscow theater by Chechen guerrillas, Mr. Putin ordered the Russian military to draft a new doctrine adapting the country's forces and tactics to meet terrorist threats.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'biographical information', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Workers at the General Motors plant here wore red-white-and-blue ribbons today for their colleague Sandy Alan Booker, who was feared dead in the siege that ended the occupation of a Moscow theater by Chechen rebels.</p> <p>Mr. Booker, 49, an electrician at the plant, went to Russia to correct some irregularities in paperwork that had delayed his Russian fiancée's arrival in the United States, said two of his co-workers, Jerry Kincannon and Mike Byrd.</p>
['medicine and health', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>American officials said yesterday that they suspected the Russian security police who raided a Moscow theater early Saturday might have used an aerosol version of a powerful, fast-acting opiate called Fentanyl to knock out Chechen extremists and prevent them from killing the 750 hostages they were holding.</p> <p>The gas killed 117 hostages, all but one of those who died in the Russian assault to retake the theater.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'bombs and explosives', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The leaders of the United States, Russia, China, Indonesia and other nations are coming here this week to argue over Washington's campaigns against terrorist groups and what it calls rogue nations.</p> <p>The agenda of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference at this resort on the tip of the Baja peninsula has been transformed. The bombing in Bali, American calls for an end to Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq and North Korea's acknowledgment that it has been trying to build nuclear weapons have transformed trade talks into a war council.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton briefed Russian officials for a second day today on American intelligence evidence that North Korea has an active nuclear weapons program. Russian officials, who indicated on Monday that the initial evidence fell short of proof, were silent after today's presentation.</p> <p>But it was not clear whether that silence signaled continued skepticism or Russian agreement that the program -- which North Korea has admitted to the United States -- must face united opposition, as the White House has urged.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In intense negotiations, the United States and Britain pressed the other three permanent members of the Security Council today to accept a draft resolution on Iraq that includes no explicit authorization of military action but leaves the way open for Washington to go to war.</p> <p>After the United States presented a revised draft on Monday, the permanent members, who hold veto power, met twice today for discussions. Council diplomats said the talks were moving forward, but Washington continued to face resistance from France and Russia to its bid for one resolution that would provide the minimum legal foundation for an American attack on Iraq.</p>
['treaties', 'terrorism', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'law and legislation']	<p>More than 100 hostages are dead after Russian authorities used an unidentified gas to incapacitate terrorists holding 750 people in a Moscow theater. Nearly all of the deaths were due to the gas, which Russian authorities have so far refused to identify.</p> <p>Press coverage has rightly emphasized grief and the question of why antidotes were not immediately available. It has then focused on whether the Russians' use of gas was a violation of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. But this focus, while important, risks overlooking the big picture when it comes to Russian chemical weapons.</p>
['public opinion', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The American ambassador to Russia said today that Russian secrecy about the use of a powerful anesthetic gas may have needlessly raised the toll in Saturday's raid on Chechen terrorists in a Moscow theater. At least 116 hostages died during the raid; another was shot dead in the hours before it.</p> <p>The ambassador, Alexander R. Vershbow, said the United States would not second-guess the Russian decision to use the gas, the decisive factor in ending the three-day siege, which trapped 763 hostages inside.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Hours after Iraq agreed with United Nations officials that weapons inspectors could return in two weeks, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said tonight that any search of Saddam Hussein's arsenals should be delayed until the Security Council approves a ''new, strong, tough resolution'' setting terms.</p> <p>''We will not be satisfied with Iraqi half-truths or Iraqi compromises or Iraqi efforts to get us back into the same swamp that they took the United Nations into'' in the past, Secretary Powell said at a hastily called news conference at the State Department as the Bush administration scrambled to salvage its push for a new United Nations resolution.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>Listing hulks of fishing boats rust in harbor waters here. On the potholed road to town, a crow perches on a car carcass. In the main square, weeds grow waist high through cracks in concrete. The town hall sits abandoned after a 1994 earthquake, its windows broken long ago by boys with rocks.</p> <p>Lost for weeks at a time in the North Pacific fog, Kunashir, this desolate island of forgotten dreams and dwindling population, is also the apple of the eye of Japan's newly muscular nationalist right wing. Because Stalin broke a nonaggression pact with Japan and invaded here two weeks after the end of World War II, there is, officially, no peace between two great Pacific powers: Russia and Japan.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A deputy oil minister from Iraq will come to Moscow on Wednesday for a two-day lobbying effort with Russia, as it decides how to respond to the Bush administration's proposed resolution on Iraqi weapons.</p> <p>The deputy minister, Husein al-Hasidi, will ''meet with his colleagues in Russia and with representatives of Russian oil companies to increase cooperation over oil in the framework of the U.N. program,'' said Abbas Khalaf Kunfuth, the Iraqi ambassador to Russia. The visit comes as Russian and American oil executives met in Houston.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>At last week's meeting of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Russian delegation insisted that the terms of reference for arms inspection in Iraq already provide adequate legal basis for access to relevant sites. The Russians believe that negotiation of a new resolution would only delay further the return of the inspectors. They have in private questioned the validity of the Bush administration's assertion that Iraq is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>What is driving Russia's actions at the United Nations? Self interest, of course. Iraq owes Russia about $8 billion on loans dating back to the Soviet era; Russia fears the debts will be renounced if there is regime change. Private contracts benefiting Russian oil companies are in place. Under the United Nations' oil-for-food program, Russian contractors have been by far the biggest beneficiaries. Forty percent of Iraqi oil traded under the program is sold via Russian intermediaries. Considering the dismal state of Russia's economy, the $1 billion a year Russia gains from the program is alone an important motivating factor.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States presented the Security Council today with a proposal for a resolution, revised to draw the support of France, that would give Iraq a last chance to accept rigorous weapons inspections and disarm or face an American-led war.</p> <p>France did not immediately accept the draft today. President Jacques Chirac agreed in a telephone conversation with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to try to ''remove certain ambiguities'' about the use of force, a spokeswoman in Paris said.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had more angry comments today about Chechen separatists. But he appeared to take pains to soften the blow of an outburst on Monday in which he made a coarse remark about circumcision and accused the Islamic rebels of wanting ''to kill all non-Muslims, all cross-bearers.''</p> <p>After meetings here with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany and Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik of Norway, Mr. Putin said that the Chechen rebels made poor negotiating partners. ''What these people want is a global caliphate,'' he said.</p>
['banks and banking', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Russian government set the terms today for the auction of the state's controlling stake in Slavneft, an oil company. The sale may turn out to be the most competitive Russian privatization since the end of Communism.</p> <p>Russia's Federal Property Fund set the minimum price for 74.95 percent of Slavneft at $1.7 billion, substantially more than it had originally indicated it would ask. The winning bidder will be selected Dec. 18, with proceeds of the sale expected to flow into government coffers in February, just before a group of large debt payments come due.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>This week, President Bush travels to Prague for his first NATO summit meeting, seeking to redefine the mission of the trans-Atlantic alliance and to win support from its members for a possible assault on Iraq, officials said today.</p> <p>Mr. Bush is to leave Tuesday for a day of meetings with heads of state on Wednesday and a two-day summit meeting on Thursday and Friday. He will then make a four-hour stop in St. Petersburg to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. On Saturday, Mr. Bush will make speeches in Lithuania and Romania before returning to Washington that evening.</p>
['ethics', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>For four years little but rumor swirled around the killing of Galina V. Starovoitova, a prominent member of Parliament who was shot three times in the head in her apartment stairwell. Much of it was false, some of it lurid.</p> <p>Then, 10 days ago, the cloak of secrecy that has shrouded the investigation lifted, ever so briefly. Russia's Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., a successor of the Soviet K.G.B., announced that investigators had arrested and charged six men in the case.</p>
['terrorism', 'demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare']	<p>Denmark has so far refused to extradite a senior Chechen leader the police arrested on Wednesday, saying that Russian prosecutors had yet to provide evidence that he was involved in terrorist activities.</p> <p>Relations between Denmark and Russia soured badly in the wake of the siege of a Moscow theater by a group of Chechen guerrillas after Danish authorities refused to shut down a two-day conference of Chechen representatives earlier this week in Copenhagen.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution today that President Bush called a ''final test'' of Saddam Hussein's willingness to disarm, saying the Iraqi president's response must be ''prompt and unconditional, or he will face the severest consequences.''</p> <p>''Any act of delay or defiance will be an additional breach of Iraq's international obligations, and a clear signal that the Iraqi regime has once again abandoned the path of voluntary compliance,'' Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Seven long weeks into negotiations in the Security Council over a resolution to disarm Iraq, there has been a shift this week toward the United States and British draft proposal for aggressive weapons inspections backed by a clear threat of war, according to Council diplomats representing the United States and some nonpermanent members.</p> <p>France and Russia, both permanent members, are still demanding a second vote based on United Nations arms inspections before authorizing military force. But indications from the two chief United Nations weapons inspectors that they are comfortable with the strong inspections plan proposed in the draft helped persuade nonpermanent Council nations that the proposal was not far off the mark.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Near the grassy edge of the cemetery lay the bodies of five young men, waiting for burial. Their faces were bruised and torn. Some necks bore traces of rope marks. The men of this small town stood silently in a circle around them, their hands occasionally rising to their faces in a Muslim prayer.</p> <p>The five men were taken from their homes here in Chechnya after midnight on Oct. 27, less than 48 hours after Russian forces ended the 57-hour siege of a Moscow theater by Chechen terrorists. Ten groups of about 15 Russian-speaking men in black-and-gray camouflage wearing black masks went to each house, witnesses said. The witnesses did not wish to be identified because they fear for their lives.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The authorities in Turkmenistan said today that they had detained at least 16 suspects in an attempted assassination of the country's authoritarian president, Saparmurat A. Niyazov. They accused Russia and other countries of tacitly supporting exiled opposition leaders who they said had organized the attack.</p> <p>The arrests and the pointed accusations against Mr. Niyazov's political opponents abroad appear to signal a harsh response to the attack, which took place on Monday in the country's capital, Ashgabat.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>With the Security Council moving toward approving a resolution on Friday to force Saddam Hussein to disarm, President Bush warned today that if Mr. Hussein failed to comply, Washington and its allies would ''move swiftly with force to do the job.''</p> <p>In a news conference, Mr. Bush also issued his most explicit warning yet to the generals serving Mr. Hussein, saying they would be ''held to account'' if they responded to any attack by endangering lives in Iraq or in neighboring countries. Without saying so precisely, he was clearly warning them against executing any orders from Mr. Hussein to release chemical or biological weapons or to take aim at Israel if Iraq were attacked.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic energy']	<p>American intelligence and defense officials have concluded that Russia -- one of the Bush administration's most important allies in the campaign against terrorism -- supplied Iran with much of the equipment and expertise it used to build two new facilities that appear to American intelligence agencies to be part of a nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>The case is the latest example of the Bush administration's growing difficulties with nations that it has hailed as allies in its efforts against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Russian government today angrily condemned a decision by Iraq to cancel a large oil contract with a Russian oil company, calling it a blow to relations between the countries.</p> <p>Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement: ''Such a step can only be interpreted as going against the friendly nature of Russian-Iraqi relations. It evokes bewilderment that it was done at a time when Russia is trying to ease tensions around Iraq.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, joined Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today in urging Pakistan to abandon its support for Islamic militants who strike India and to oppose the use of force to resolve the situation with Iraq.</p> <p>At the end of talks in New Delhi, the two leaders signed an agreement -- the Delhi Declaration -- for the ''further consolidation of strategic partnership'' between India and Russia, whose cold war friendship has endured in its aftermath.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The United States stepped back from provoking a rift in the Security Council today by reaching a compromise with Russia to extend a huge aid program in Iraq for an additional six months.</p> <p>The Bush administration dropped its demand to hold up the renewal for two weeks to add 40 items to a list of goods whose purchase by Iraq is restricted under the program. Instead, Washington and Moscow agreed to revise the list in 30 days.</p>
['finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The British oil company BP has submitted a bid for a 75 percent stake in the Russian oil company Slavneft, in a prominent sale being held by the Russian government this month, the Russian news agency Prime Tass said yesterday.</p> <p>The news agency, citing a source close to the Russian Federal Property Fund, said BP, one of the largest foreign investors in the Russian oil sector, had applied to take part in the auction, which closes on Dec. 15.</p>

['missiles and missile defense systems', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Iraq said today that it canceled a large oil contract with a Russian oil company because executives from the company had met with the Iraqi opposition-in-exile.</p> <p>Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said in an interview with The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, that the contract with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, had been canceled because it had discussed the fate of a major oil field with opponents of President Saddam Hussein. ''Lukoil went to Washington to get assurances that their contract will be implemented after the removal of the Iraqi regime,'' Mr. Aziz said in the interview published today. ''This is outrageous of them because they signed a contract with us. Such conduct cannot be accepted.''</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia has begun deploying a squadron of fighter jets, bombers and other aircraft to Kyrgyzstan, expanding its military presence in former Soviet territory in Central Asia after the opening of American bases there last year as part of the war in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The aircraft are the vanguard of a force that will ultimately include more than 20 Russian aircraft and more than 700 troops, Defense Ministry officials here and in Kyrgyzstan said today.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>The president of Iran said today that his country would continue construction of a Russian-assisted nuclear power plant and that the plant's nuclear waste would be taken to Russia for safekeeping. But American officials said the United States was still concerned that the plant was part of a secret nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>The comments about the plant, which were made by President Mohammad Khatami during a visit to Pakistan, added to American concerns about the nuclear weapons capabilities of Iran and North Korea, two of the three nations that President Bush has called an ''axis of evil.'' The third country is Iraq.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'espionage', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Russia said today that it would not continue the agreement under which American Peace Corps volunteers work in this country.</p> <p>In recent months, Russia has increasingly criticized American Peace Corps volunteers there, accused them of spying and refused to renew their visas.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>The unofficial death toll in the bombing of Russian regional offices in Chechnya on Friday soared today past 80, and President Vladimir V. Putin warned that militants were using more violent tactics in a campaign to sabotage the restoration of Russian rule in the region.</p> <p>But Mr. Putin said no amount of violence would disrupt plans for a long-delayed constitutional referendum in Chechnya this spring, a vote billed as the start of a new era of civil rule in the war-ravaged republic. A draft constitution would establish Chechnya as a self-ruling republic in the Russian Federation, a status held by a number of other regions.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea said today that pressure and isolation would not persuade North Korea to end its nuclear arms program, pointing up the South's differences with the United States.</p> <p>''Pressure and isolation have never been successful with Communist countries; Cuba is one example,'' Mr. Kim told his cabinet, in remarks tailored for an American audience. The United States has announced a plan of political and economic pressure against North Korea to try to force it to halt its renewed nuclear arms efforts.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Security Council, acceding to anxious pressure from the United States, voted today to revise a list of goods that must be approved by the United Nations before Iraq can import them.</p> <p>In a sign of fissures in the unity the United States achieved in November with Resolution 1441, which obliged Iraq to cooperate with new weapons inspections, Russia and Syria abstained today. The other 13 Council members voted in favor.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>China and Russia called on North Korea today to abandon any attempt to acquire nuclear weapons but also called on Washington to honor previous agreements with the North.</p> <p>The call came during a quick but high-profile visit by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that was marked by hearty pledges of mutual friendship and appeals for restraint on Iraq.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Russian government announced late today that it would once again try to sell a 5.9 percent stake in Lukoil, the country's largest oil company, four months after it called off the sale because the prices offered were too low.</p> <p>Since the cancellation in August, Lukoil's share price has risen 16 percent. At today's closing market price, the government's stake would be worth $812 million, compared with about $600 million the government was expecting to receive in August.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Bush calls him evil and says he is building nuclear bombs. Japanese officials say his missiles are aimed at Tokyo. Human rights groups say he uses concentration camps to stay in power.

['treaties']	<p>Russia has signed a new security pact with Kyrgyzstan, where a Russian air squadron and up to 1,000 Russian troops will be based by year's end as part of a new rapid-reaction force that marks a major deployment for the Russian military in formerly Soviet Central Asia.</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin, visiting the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, as part of an Asian tour, said Russia would have 20 aircraft and about 1,000 troops in place at a base some 40 miles from where American troops are based in Kyrgyzstan. The planes and soldiers will join forces from two other Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>A small piece of history, which for decades served as a crucial source for scholars of the Soviet Union, was returned yesterday when 541 records taken from Communist Party archives by the Nazis in 1941 were handed over to the Russian government by the American Ambassador, Alexander Vershbow.</p> <p>The story of how the records from the western Russian city of Smolensk traveled from the Soviet Union to Nazi Germany, then to the National Archives in Washington, and now back to Russia encapsulates the perplexing and often secretive fate of historical documents during and after World War II.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Iran and Russia signed an agreement today to speed up the completion of a nuclear power plant that the United States fears could help Iran build nuclear weapons, the official Islamic Republic News Agency Reported.</p> <p>They also agreed to set up a commission to examine building another one, and Russia said that for the next 10 years it would provide fuel for the reactor at Bushire in southern Iran.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'elections']	<p>President Bush joined today with envoys from Europe, Russia and the United Nations in a new call for the creation of a Palestinian state in three years. But the administration and its partners remained divided over how quickly to press their plan for such a state on Israel and the Palestinians.</p> <p>European leaders and other planners want the three-year timetable to be formally adopted and published now. The Europeans, including those who support Mr. Bush on Iraq, are openly worried that without a vigorous Middle East peace negotiation under way, a war to oust Saddam Hussein in Baghdad could spread turmoil throughout the Arab world.</p>
['suits and litigation', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In less than five minutes of bidding, Russia auctioned control of one of the country's last large state-owned oil companies today. The sale, once expected to be the most open and competitive in recent Russian history, instead gave new meaning to the word opaque. The outcome was immediately denounced as rigged by a frustrated would-be bidder.</p> <p>The Federal Property Fund, trustee for business assets owned by the Russian state, sold its 75 percent stake in Slavneft, ranked No. 9 in the Russian oil industry, for $1.86 billion -- more than the minimum the government had set, but still well below what the market had expected. The sale was the second-largest post-Soviet privatization, after the controversial sale of Russia's telephone conglomerate in 1997.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia warned today that President Bush's order to field a limited missile-defense system in 2004 had pushed the venture into ''a destabilizing new phase,'' but here, as in many places, weary shrugs were the dominant response to the American decision, which had long been considered inevitable.</p> <p>Britain said it was ''very seriously'' considering an American request to upgrade its early warning radar network to support the new shield. Denmark was studying a similar request, for use of the Thule base in Greenland, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin issued a decree today calling for a constitutional referendum in Chechnya in March, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections for the republic in 2004, in an effort to stabilize the rebellious region.</p> <p>Chechen representatives loyal to Moscow met in Chechnya yesterday and endorsed a draft of the proposed constitution, which reaffirms the republic's status as an integral part of the Russian Federation.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Iraq abruptly canceled a contract with Russia's largest oil company and two other Russian companies to develop a major Iraqi oil field.</p> <p>Iraq's decision -- announced in a letter to the company, Lukoil, on Monday -- amounted to a rebuff to Russia, one of Baghdad's strongest supporters at a time when the United States is threatening to go to war over what the Bush administration says is President Saddam Hussein's pursuit of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Irene Stevenson, an American labor activist, had lived and worked in Russia since 1989. Late last year, her organization, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. affiliate financed by the United States government, counseled the union for air-traffic controllers as they threatened to strike.</p> <p>On Dec. 30, when she returned to Moscow after a brief Christmas vacation, she was curtly turned away at the airport and denied entry even though her visa had been renewed a month before. Her name, it seems, is now on Russia's watch list as a threat to national security.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Last year, politicians opposing an attack on Saddam claimed it would somehow interfere with our global war on Al Qaeda.</p> <p>This year, a new excuse for delay is being advanced: the nuclear threat from North Korean Stalinists is more immediate, and therefore we should seek an accommodation with them before taking on Saddam.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>European and other leaders today welcomed President Bush's State of the Union announcement that the United States would disclose its evidence on Iraqi weapons programs, but other responses to the speech mirrored the disagreements that have long existed on the issue of any war with Iraq.</p> <p>''I'm delighted by this American decision,'' the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, said. But, gently chiding the Bush administration, he added: ''It's been several weeks that we have been asking all those who have information to give it to the inspectors. We will study the American information. We will provide our own information. We will gather all of the information together in order to examine the situation from there on.''</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'immigration and refugees', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>The international organization Human Rights Watch issued a broad condemnation of the Russian government's human rights policies in Chechnya today. The Kremlin was accused of using harassment and lies to force civilians from refugee camps and allowing its military to beat and abduct Chechen civilians with virtual impunity.</p> <p>The group also said that Chechen guerrillas had ignored global conventions banning human rights abuses in internal conflicts and that representatives of Chechen separatist movements had offered only tepid objections to the guerrillas' campaigns of terror and murder.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan signed an agreement today calling for an accelerated effort to resolve the long-standing territorial dispute over the Kurile Islands that has left Russia and Japan technically in a state of war for six decades.</p> <p>In a meeting at the Kremlin that was overshadowed by North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the leaders pledged to pursue deeper economic and political ties even as they try to resolve a dispute that has bedeviled governments of both countries since the Soviet Union seized the islands at the end of World War II.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia announced today that it would hold a constitutional referendum in Chechnya on March 23, advancing an effort by Moscow to demonstrate to Russians and the world that the war in the breakaway republic is over.</p> <p>A government commission gathered 17,000 signatures from Chechens and Russian soldiers in the republic, just more than the legal requirement to conduct a referendum. The vote on the new constitution will be followed by presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'united states armament and defense', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>In a darkened public meeting hall, Boris Shikhmuradov's face shone from a giant television screen. He spoke the words of his confession haltingly. He wore no expression. His eyes were cast downward.</p> <p>''We are a criminal group, a mafia,'' Mr. Shikhmuradov said, trance-like. ''Among us there is not one normal person. We are all nobodies. I am not a person capable of running a country. I am a criminal, able only to destroy it.''</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Bush's new approach to North Korea, involving an offer to consider food and fuel aid upon an agreement to dismantle the North's nuclear program, reflects a determination on the part of the administration to see the Korean crisis resolved peacefully and the focus kept on Iraq.</p> <p>With his advisers split on how to handle North Korea -- in an administration prone to ideological divisions on many international issues -- President Bush has been pressed by hard-liners to try to further isolate North Korea and hope that the dictatorship of Kim Jong Il will give in to American demands or collapse.</p>
['terrorism', 'medicine and health', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>For months, President Bush has pledged not to use food as a weapon against North Korea. But as the confrontation deepens over the North's nuclear weapons program, the United States has continued to withhold the approval of grain shipments sought by relief groups to avert starvation in North Korea.</p> <p>The World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations, says the suspension of food aid by the United States and Japan, and severe cutbacks by South Korea, have meant that, for the first time in years, it will miss its food distribution goals in North Korea this winter ''by a wide margin.''</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Iraq tried to mend relations with Russia yesterday by awarding a new oil contract to a Russian company and promising several more in what analysts called a last-ditch effort to gain allies as the Bush administration prepares for military action there.</p> <p>Hussin al-Hadithi, an under secretary at the Iraqi Oil Ministry, signed the contract yesterday in Baghdad with the Russian company Stroitransgaz for an oil field in western Iraq. The Iraqi government also set aside two other small fields for Russian companies, and began talks on a third. Russian officials, including Ivan Matlashov, the first deputy energy minister, attended the signing.</p>
['television']	<p>The American financier who runs the often-embattled NTV television network in Russia said today that he had been fired by the network's state-controlled owner, the latest chapter in a struggle that is seen as an indicator of this nation's press freedom.</p> <p>The financier, Boris Jordan, said he had been fired on Thursday from his job as chief executive officer of Gazprom Media, a holding company which owns some of Russia's best-known media properties, including NTV and the popular Ekho Moskvy news radio station. It is a unit of the huge state-controlled natural gas monopoly, Gazprom.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia has been quietly negotiating with North Korea to defuse tensions caused by the resumption of its nuclear programs, officials here said even as they expressed reluctance to exert the strong diplomatic or economic pressure on North Korea called for by the Bush administration.</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin and other officials have adamantly called on North Korea to end any nuclear-weapons programs and reverse its decision, announced on Friday, to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'espionage']	<p>Russian intelligence officers secretly placed sophisticated nuclear detection equipment inside North Korea at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1990's, to assist the United States in tracking the North Korean nuclear weapons program, intelligence officials say.</p> <p>The Russians placed nuclear monitors provided by the C.I.A. inside the Russian Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to try to detect telltale signs of activity from the North Korean nuclear weapons program. The C.I.A. trained officers from the S.V.R., the Russian intelligence agency, in the operation of the American equipment, and the Russians then shared their findings with the Americans.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel today accused European states of bias in favor of the Palestinians, criticizing their role in an American-backed plan for Middle East peace.</p> <p>Mr. Sharon sought to align Israel with the United States and against the three other members of a so-called diplomatic quartet -- the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- that has drawn up a detailed ''road map'' for peace and a Palestinian state in 2005.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>For months, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has been the Bush administration's leading advocate of diplomacy, patiently applied, to rally the international community behind a campaign of pressure on Saddam Hussein to cooperate with United Nations inspectors.</p> <p>Today, responding to the United Nations inspectors' report, he sounded more impatient and less diplomatic.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Hans Blix, one of the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, gave a broadly negative report today on Iraq's cooperation with two months of inspections, providing support to the Bush administration's campaign to disarm Iraq by force if necessary.</p> <p>''Iraq appears not to have come to genuine acceptance -- not even today -- of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and live in peace,'' Mr. Blix said, summing up a grim 15-page catalog of Iraq's chemical and biological arms programs that provided an exhaustive account of ways in which Saddam Hussein has failed to prove that he has eliminated illegal weapons. [Transcript, Page A10.]</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service today dismissed as false a report in The New York Times on Monday stating that the service had joined forces with the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1990's to monitor North Korea's nuclear program.</p> <p>The agency's spokesman, Boris Labusov, said in a telephone interview that the agency denied the details of the article, which he said had alleged that ''some deal was struck between the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia and the C.I.A. of the United States against the interests of the Korean People's Democratic Republic.'' In a separate interview with the Interfax News Agency, Mr. Labusov called the report ''inconsistent with reality.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Germany will not insist on a second Security Council resolution if there is a new debate on whether to authorize war in Iraq, Gunter Pleuger, the German ambassador to the United Nations, said today. But it believes that weapons inspectors are making progress, he added, and should be given time to do their work.</p> <p>In an interview, Mr. Pleuger, leaning closer to the United States on a contentious issue than to France and several other Council powers, said that a second round of voting in the Council would be ''desirable but not necessary'' if Iraq commits obvious breaches of past resolutions.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Few would call them bellwethers, but there are signs this week that Russia is softening its long-stated skepticism and even hostility toward American military action in Iraq even as the rumble of war appears to be ever closer.</p> <p>Moreover, United States officials have hopes of speeding that conversion by offering what one called persuasive evidence of Iraq's support for terrorists operating in Russia's troubled Caucasus region.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>At the presidential palace here, a confident President Nursultan Nazarbayev strode out in December to greet foreign investors. It was all smiles for the cameras as Mr. Nazarbayev sat down with the investors, most of them oil executives, to talk about recent business developments in this vast country, rich in energy resources.</p> <p>But behind the facade of friendliness, tensions could not be hidden. A consortium had recently halted a long-planned $3.5 billion expansion at the largest oil development project in Kazakhstan, in a standoff with the government over the terms of the contract.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>United Nations weapons inspectors discovered 11 empty chemical warheads today at an ammunition storage depot in southern Iraq, while another team entered the homes of two Iraqi scientists unannounced, carting away documents.</p> <p>The inspectors stumbled on the warheads in a bunker at the Ukhaider Ammunition Storage Area, about 90 miles southwest of Baghdad. The trove included 11 empty 122-millimeter chemical warheads and ''one warhead that requires further evaluation,'' said Hiro Ueki, the spokesman for the inspectors in Baghdad. He did not elaborate.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly began consultations with South Korea's president-elect and other officials today about the nuclear threat from North Korea, as the North Korean government maintained a barrage of bellicose statements.</p> <p>There were other developments in the United States and Russia on Sunday indicating that a diplomatic solution might be a bit closer. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations who talked with North Korean representatives last week, said he expected low-level talks to begin between the United States and North Korea at the United Nations. And the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed some optimism about a possible settlement of the crisis.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Almost a century after Japan beat Russia in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905, Junichiro Koizumi today made the first visit of a Japanese prime minister to the Russian Far East, a sprawling, resource-rich region that stretches from Siberia to disputed islands north of Japan.</p> <p>This time it was not territorial conquest but a geopolitical chess game with China over Russian oil that brought Mr. Koizumi to this 19th-century railroad city, where ice sculptures glittered in subzero temperatures. Donning a fur hat in the Arctic cold, Mr. Koizumi, leader of the world's second-largest oil consumer, openly appealed for the construction of a 2,500-mile oil pipeline that would bypass China, bringing Siberian oil to the Sea of Japan.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>While the United States is trying to hurry things along in the debate in the United Nations about Iraq, other members of the Security Council are becoming more determined to take their time.</p> <p>Differing interpretations of the timetable and procedures laid out in Resolution 1441 had been simmering under the surface since its unanimous adoption on Nov. 8 setting up the new round of weapons inspections in Iraq. Now those differences have percolated into view as the United States has made clear it wants to pass judgment on the results of the inspections much sooner than others on the 15-seat Council.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela failed today to win backing from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil to include Russia, France and other ''friendly'' nations in a United States-sponsored mediation effort to restore peace to Venezuela.</p> <p>Mr. Chávez, who is facing growing demands from opponents at home to resign as Venezuela's economy buckles under a seven-week-long strike, said here today that he was ''grateful for the good faith and will to help'' shown by other nations. But he insisted that the mediation group formed by the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Portugal and Chile be broadened.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>A week after its nuclear inspectors were expelled from North Korea, the International Atomic Energy Agency said today that it would give the North Korean government ''one more chance'' to readmit them before referring the dispute to the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>The agency's board, which includes the United States, Russia, China and 32 other nations, passed a resolution that ''deplores in the strongest terms'' the expulsion of the inspectors and the dismantling of their cameras, which were trained on nuclear sites to record signs of unauthorized activities.</p>
['finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Crude oil prices dipped today, after officials of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said they would raise output targets and after the energy ministers of the world's two largest oil exporters -- Russia and Saudi Arabia -- indicated they wanted to bring down soaring prices.</p> <p>In New York trading, the benchmark price, West Texas intermediate grade oil for February delivery, fell 98 cents a barrel, to $32.10. Similar drops in price of about 3 percent occurred in other crude oil indexes.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'credit', 'international trade and world market', 'immigration and refugees', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'terrorism']	<p>While in North Korea years ago, I barged into as many private homes as possible, and every single one had The Speaker.</p> <p>The Speaker is like a radio, but permanently on and without a choice of stations. It's the electronic umbilical cord from the Great Leader, waking citizens up each morning and putting them to bed each evening with a mix of heroic songs, denunciations of ''the American war-maniacs'' and tributes to Kim Jong Il, ''the greatest of great men produced by heaven.''</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>After visits by Australian and Russian diplomats to North Korea, and days before the arrival of South Korean and Indonesian envoys, North Korea warned today that other countries ''do not need to poke their nose into'' its nuclear bomb program.</p> <p>''The only way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, peacefully and in a most fair way, is for the D.P.R.K. and the U.S. to hold direct and equal negotiations,'' the state news agency said, using the initials of North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</p>
['ethics', 'biographical information']	<p>Not long after Boris N. Yeltsin chose him as an adviser, Georgi A. Satarov decided to conduct an experiment. He invited top officials from Russia's police force, its Federal Security Service, and prosecutor's office to the Kremlin. Then he proposed that the officials plant bribe-givers in their ranks.</p> <p>The idea was to identify sources of corruption in government. It was based on the F.B.I's Abscam campaign of the 1970's that entrapped members of Congress who took bribes from agents posing as Arab businessmen.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell warned today that if Saddam Hussein was still not cooperating with United Nations inspectors at the end of this week, President Bush would press immediately for consideration of a Security Council resolution authorizing possible use of force against Iraq.</p> <p>Mr. Powell's comments laid out what appeared to be an accelerating timetable in the confrontation with Iraq, even as France, Germany and other members of the Security Council continued to call for more time before considering the use of force.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Diplomatic efforts to avert war in Iraq intensified in Europe today, with France and Germany, supported by Russia, collaborating on proposals to give United Nations weapons inspectors more time.</p> <p>France and Germany denied reports that they were working on a secret plan to disarm Iraq while avoiding war, but confirmed they were in talks about strengthening United Nations' weapons inspections based on proposals made by the French last week.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign aid']	<p>Forty years ago, the two countries were the closest of political brethren, building Communist paradises, marching to the same revolutionary beat. But time changed everything.</p> <p>Today, while one brother, Cuba, has mostly stayed the course, the other, China, is brimming with entrepreneurs and foreign multinationals and has recently joined the World Trade Organization.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell goes before the Security Council on Wednesday to discuss Iraq, his appearance will inevitably be contrasted with what was probably the most dramatic event in the Council's history -- the moment the United States showed the world photographic evidence of Soviet missiles in Cuba.</p> <p>On Oct. 22, 1962, charging that the Kremlin was building missile bases on Cuba, the United States imposed a naval blockade around the island. Three days later, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai E. Stevenson, came before the Council to demand that the Soviet Union remove the missiles. When his Soviet counterpart, Valerian A. Zorin, said the United States had no evidence to support its accusations, Stevenson challenged him directly:</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The rift between the United States and Europe deepened even further today as France, Germany and Russia issued an informal ''memorandum'' calling for at least four more months of weapons inspections in Iraq. The document was released as the United States, Britain and Spain introduced a United Nations Security Council resolution declaring that Baghdad has failed to disarm as required and must face ''serious consequences,'' diplomatic code for war.</p> <p>The memorandum, drafted by the French and circulated at the United Nations today, was supported by the Chinese, French officials said. Senior French officials said Paris did not intend for the document to be treated as a draft Security Council resolution.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush's decision to go all out to win a second Security Council endorsement to wage war on Iraq was made primarily to help a friend and ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair, say experts who follow British affairs. But the determined opposition of France, Germany and Russia expose Mr. Bush to the risk of diplomatic embarrassment.</p> <p>''He has to do it primarily because it is now a necessary action to ease Tony Blair's problems,'' with the torrent of popular domestic opposition to war, said James R. Schlesinger, a former secretary of defense and a member of the Defense Policy Board that advises the Pentagon. ''It is also an indication of our deep and abiding hope in the efficacy of the U.N.,'' Mr. Schlesinger added.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States, Britain and Spain asked the Security Council today to declare that Iraq had missed its last chance to disarm to avoid a war. But France, Russia and Germany moved to strengthen the United Nations inspections and give Saddam Hussein months more to show that he is complying.</p> <p>The American ambassador to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte, told reporters after the session that he viewed the approach by those three nations with ''deep skepticism,'' and senior Bush administration officials predicted that the outcome would soon be either Mr. Hussein's exile or military action to disarm Iraq and topple his government.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Bush administration is developing plans for sanctions against North Korea, that would include halting its weapons shipments and cutting off money sent there by Koreans living in Japan, in the event that North Korea continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons, senior administration officials say.</p> <p>The officials said late last week the administration had no plans to push for the sanctions soon, since the United States' Pacific allies still oppose the idea and the United Nations Security Council is likely to remain focused on Iraq for weeks.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'foreign aid', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A panel of arms experts convened by United Nations weapons inspectors has confirmed that a missile Iraq has developed exceeds range limits set by the Security Council.</p> <p>The panel's conclusion will add fuel to the United States' argument that Iraq is defying Security Council disarmament resolutions, and it is likely to deepen the discord here over whether to go to war against Iraq or allow inspections to continue, as several critical Council nations insist.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>With some deft diplomatic maneuvering in Berlin and Paris, President Vladimir V. Putin has vaulted Russia this week into the unexpected position of being the potential swing vote in a looming United Nations debate over military action against Iraq.</p> <p>Now comes something far more difficult: deciding which way to swing.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'demonstrations and riots', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Twenty years ago this month, I was an aide to Vice President George Bush during another trans-Atlantic crisis. There were demonstrations in European capitals in which America was portrayed as the threat to world peace and the American president was called a warmonger, a ''cowboy'' and worse. Vice President Bush's response in February 1983 may hold some lessons for President Bush in February 2003.</p> <p>Two decades ago the vice president was dispatched to London to calm things down, to hold hands, to remind our European friends and allies that we were still all in this together. What made his trip necessary was the controversy over deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe; several years earlier, the Europeans had requested that the United States place Pershing 2 missiles in Europe to counter Soviet medium-range missiles that were aimed at the Continent.</p>

The passengers were members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of the army responsible for defending the revolution and for safeguarding border areas.</p>

['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States and Britain have decided that their strategy in the United Nations will be to try to persuade 9 of the 15 members of the Security Council to back a new resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, and then to challenge France, Russia or China to veto the will of the Council's majority, administration officials said today.</p> <p>American and British officials worked today to settle their differences over the resolution's language while refining it to attract the support of other Council members. Administration officials said the talks meant the resolution would not be introduced until next week, possibly on Monday.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Pundits and officials in Washington have dubbed Secretary of State Colin Powell's attempt to make a case for war against Iraq in the United Nations Security Council an ''Adlai Stevenson moment.''</p> <p>I couldn't disagree more. My father was Adlai Stevenson, who in 1962, as President Kennedy's representative to the United Nations, presented the Security Council with incontrovertible proof that the Soviet Union, a nuclear superpower, was installing missiles in Cuba and threatening to upset the world's ''balance of terror.''</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Although the Bush administration is not yet assured of the nine votes necessary to win another resolution authorizing war against Iraq, officials see tremendous advantages to having an endorsement from the Security Council, even if it passes with abstentions from France, Russia and China, veto-bearing permanent powers.</p> <p>American officials were encouraged to consider new Council negotiations as they perceived declining support in Europe for France and Germany, the main Council opponents to war.</p>
['children and youth', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>In the bacchanal that is today's Russia, where post-Soviet values are nurtured by market forces, where popular culture is laced with crime and pornography and where drugs and alcohol ravage a nation's health, a youth group called Walking Together offers itself as a path to social and moral -- and some say political -- rectitude.</p> <p>The group's leaders organize summer camps with the Russian Orthodox Church and trips to historic cities. Members visit orphans and war veterans. Last year, they promoted participation in Russia's census. Recently, they sent 20 young volunteers to teach social studies in Chechnya's schools.</p>
['television', 'news and news media', 'ethics']	<p>A short while back, Italy's leading newspaper, Corriere della Sera, ran a cartoon that imagined Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's continuing evolution. In the first panel, he was chief of state. In a later panel, he was king. Finally, years hence, he morphed into a new-era Napoleon.</p> <p>Within the hyperbolic context of satire, it was a fairly apt commentary on Mr. Berlusconi's outsize ambitions. It may also have been prophetic, casting him as a brash emperor whose troubles ultimately undo his triumphs.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Washington's staunchest ally and the greatest European champion of an eventual war with Iraq, failed today to persuade President Jacques Chirac of France to endorse military action through the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>Meeting Mr. Chirac a day before Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was to lay out Washington's case against Iraq at the United Nations, Mr. Blair did not get the backing he needed for a second Security Council resolution that would explicitly endorse war. The British prime minister, like other European leaders, faces mounting opposition at home to any military action.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>France and Germany closed ranks against the United States today, blocking attempts by NATO to begin military planning for a conflict with Iraq and issuing a joint declaration with Russia calling for intensified weapons inspections as an alternative to war.</p> <p>In a statement issued here, Russia, Germany and France called for a ''substantial strengthening'' of the ''human and technical capabilites'' of the weapons inspectors in Iraq, arguing that the inspections should continue in more vigorous form before war is contemplated.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Following are excerpts from a meeting of the United Nations Security Council yesterday after reports by the chief weapons inspectors, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.

['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously endorsed a treaty today that obliges the United States and Russia to cut their strategic nuclear arsenals by two-thirds over the next 10 years, granting President Bush a long-delayed foreign policy victory.</p> <p>The 19-to-0 vote sends the treaty, which was signed by Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V.

['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A Stevenson moment?</p> <p>In many ways, Secretary of State Colin L.

['biographical information']	<p>Ending a 30-year diplomatic estrangement, the presidents of Pakistan and Russia met in the Kremlin today and pledged a fresh start to relations after decades of alliances with each other's sworn enemies.</p> <p>But the reconciliation was tempered by the Kremlin's announcement that President Vladimir V. Putin had telephoned the prime minister of Pakistan's still-bitter enemy, India, apparently to reassure him that today's meeting would not affect their close ties.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, pressing the American case for a possible war to disarm Iraq, today presented photographs, intercepts of conversations between Iraqi military officers and information from defectors aimed at proving that Saddam Hussein poses an imminent danger to the world.</p> <p>Among the evidence presented at the United Nations Security Council were recordings of Iraqis referring to ''nerve agents,'' and to apparent efforts to remove incriminating material before the arrival of United Nations inspectors. Scratchy-sounding voices in Arabic saying, ''We evacuated everything,'' ''Remove,'' and ''Forbidden ammo,'' echoed eerily in a chamber clearly tense over the possibility of war.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Following are excerpts from a meeting of the United Nations Security Council yesterday after the address by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript is online: nytimes.com/international.</p> <p>FOREIGN MINISTER TANG JIAXUAN OF CHINA -- . . . The inspections have been going on for more than two months now. The two agencies have been working very hard and their work deserves our recognition. It is their view that now they are not in a position to draw conclusions, and they suggested continuing with the inspections. We should respect the views of the two agencies and support the continuation of their work.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>Russia has a long and honored tradition of exile: Lenin, for instance, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Now, in the latest and perhaps least likely addition, there is Boris A. Berezovsky, the Soviet-era mathematician and oligarch of robber-baron capitalism, onetime Kremlin kingmaker and now plain old self-exiled billionaire.</p> <p>Mr. Berezovsky, an intense, balding 57-year-old in svelte pinstripe, whose desk ornaments include photographs of Boris N. Yeltsin and Rupert Murdoch, lives these days just south of London in a walled seven-bedroom, 10,000-square-foot mansion, commuting with his two private bodyguards to an office just off Park Lane.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'accidents and safety', 'space stations', 'law and legislation', 'space']	<p>Plans for more Russian help in maintaining the International Space Station while American space shuttles are grounded are limited by a law that bars direct financial support for the Russian program, NASA officials said today.</p> <p>While negotiations are under way with the Russians, and other partners in the international project, to keep the station functioning and staffed until shuttle flights resume, options are limited because of a law from 2000 that was intended to keep the Russians from helping Iran with rocket technology.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The tension that is now rising within the Western alliance, NATO and the U.N. over how to deal with Iraq is deeply disturbing. It raises fears that the postwar security system, which stabilized the world for 50 years, could come unglued if America intervenes alone in Iraq. At the birth of this security system, Secretary of State Dean Acheson wrote a memoir titled ''Present at the Creation.'' Can we deal with Iraq and still ensure that Secretary of State Colin Powell's memoir is not titled ''Present at the Destruction''?</p> <p>Yes, we can -- if we, the Russians, the Chinese and the French all take a deep breath, understand our common interests and pursue them with a little more common sense and a little less bluster.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>France, offering an alternative to the United States' drive to disarm Iraq by force, circulated a detailed plan today to Security Council nations for extending and strengthening United Nations weapons inspections.</p> <p>With the support of Russia and Germany, France proposed to double and eventually triple the number of inspectors and to increase aerial surveillance flights, building its position in anticipation of a confrontation with the United States at the Council next week.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Israel sent armored columns storming into the northern Gaza Strip and this West Bank city today, killing at least 12 Palestinians as troops clashed with gunmen, demolished metal shops and homes and searched for suspects.</p> <p>Violence spiraled through the day. After Israel withdrew its forces from Gaza, Hamas broke a three-week lull in rocket attacks and fired at least three rockets from northern Gaza at the Israeli town of Sderot, wounding an Israeli man.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Russia's greatest paradox could well be that Stalin, the ruthless Soviet God who conquered Hitler and created a superpower, will live on in Russian folk memory as a hero -- rather like the French with their far more innocent Napoleon. This is not masochism, but a peculiar feature of the Russian soul. As thousands of Russians observed the 50th anniversary of Stalin's death this week -- gathering in city centers and laying wreaths at his statues -- many beyond our borders may wonder whether this nostalgia is actually a yearning for a return to totalitarianism.</p> <p>It's more complicated than that. As a Russian writer who has long watched my country try to escape its oppressive past, I feel obligated to point out that this struggle is fraught with conflicted desires. A genuine civil war is being fought in Russia between productive people aspiring to a better life (in the Western sense of the word) and others who nurse an ideology of resentment for the loss of Russia's superpower status, or even an affection for the days of Stalin.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>With an American-led war on Iraq appearing ever more likely, the United States and Britain said today that they would urge the Security Council to vote next week on a new resolution that would give Iraq until March 17 to disarm. But France, Russia and China, which hold veto power, swiftly dismissed the new proposal.</p> <p>The new move to unite the world's deeply divided powers came after the chief United Nations weapons inspectors bluntly if quietly contradicted some American and British assertions about Iraqi violations and drew sharp rebuttals from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the British foreign minister, Jack Straw.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'law and legislation']	<p>So far in her 61 years, Dashi Idrisova has been exiled from Chechnya's haunting foothills by Stalin, brought back and promised a better life by Khrushchev, seen her apartment destroyed by Boris N. Yeltsin's army in 1994, promised independence by Mr. Yeltsin in 1996 and exiled again, to her basement, when President Vladimir V. Putin's air force destroyed this city in 2000.</p> <p>Her apartment, in Chechnya's capital, has not had heat in a dozen years. Electricity is jury-rigged and sporadic. Like many Chechens, she cannot go out after dark, when the streets pop with gunfire between guerrillas and Russian troops.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>For the first time, the Bush administration has identified nine senior Iraqi officials, including Saddam Hussein and his two sons, who would be tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity after an American-led attack on Iraq, a senior American official said.</p> <p>The list of names -- compiled, but not published, by American intelligence agencies -- includes members of Mr. Hussein's inner circle who sit atop a hierarchy of 2,000 members of the Iraqi elite.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Chechnya's voters turned out en masse today to vote on a disputed new constitution, putting a first stamp of legitimacy on a proposal to bind their republic to Russia forever -- and, the Kremlin says, to hasten peace after 42 months of unusually brutal war.</p> <p>But even as the constitution's pro-Russian backers predicted its easy approval, it remained unclear how that might translate into an end to war with Islamic guerrillas who show no signs of giving up their fight.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>As several American ''big birds'' flew in from the West to airfields in the zone we protect in Iraqi Kurdistan, a freedom fighter turned to a Kurdish friend: ''I have been a pesh merga for 25 years,'' he said. ''I always dreaded the sight of aircraft because they brought death to our people. This is the first time I have seen an air force on our side.''</p> <p>The transports arriving at the rate of four a day carry U.S. forces as well as loads of weapons to enable Kurds to follow up on our air and missile strikes at Ansar and Qaeda terrorists. Together with the 70,000 Kurdish warriors who call themselves the pesh merga, ''those who face death,'' the U.S. troops being inserted daily are early elements of what will become the northern front.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A delegation of the New York-based National Council of Churches met with Russian officials as part of an effort by the council to spread its message against a war with Iraq. Representatives of the ecumenical group, which unites 36 Protestant and Orthodox Christian denominations, have met with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Pope John Paul II, as well as French Foreign Ministry officials.</p>
['medicine and health', 'books and literature', 'biographical information', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Fifty years after Stalin died, felled by a brain hemorrhage at his dacha, an exhaustive study of long-secret Soviet records lends new weight to an old theory that he was actually poisoned, perhaps to avert a looming war with the United States.</p> <p>That war may well have been closer than anyone outside the Kremlin suspected at the time, say the authors of a new book based on the records.</p>
['terrorism', 'finances']	<p>The United States designated three rebel groups in Chechnya today as ''terrorist organizations'' linked to Al Qaeda and imposed a freeze on their American assets. The groups were described as having been involved in the seizure of a Moscow theater last October in which 129 people died.</p> <p>The administration's action, announced by the State Department, was in response to a longstanding request from Russia and reflected support for President Vladimir V. Putin at a time when the United States is seeking Russian backing for a possible war against Iraq.</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Once again and with fervor, President Vladimir V. Putin today rebuffed American calls to support a possible military campaign in Iraq, arguing in an interview that war could throw the Islamic world into turmoil and that ''a crisis of this kind should be solved by exclusively peaceful means.''</p> <p>But with equal fervor, the United States now appears to be pulling out all its diplomatic stops in a drive to win a crucial swing vote in the Iraq standoff in the United Nations.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The White House said today that the only way to prevent war in Iraq would be to disarm the country and depose Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>At the same time, Russia's foreign minister threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution that says Iraq has missed its last chance of avoiding war.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Diplomats who had failed for the last two months to agree on a unified approach to the Iraq crisis met here today, with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia offering angry post-mortems on the diplomatic debacle and arguing that the planned American-led invasion to disarm Iraq and oust Saddam Hussein had no basis in international law.</p> <p>Speaking of various Security Council resolutions on the Iraq crisis, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said ''not one of these decisions authorizes the right to use force against Iraq outside the United Nations charter.'' Like his counterparts from France and Germany, he continued to argue that the inspections process had achieved results in disarming Iraq.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>I have a confession to make. Right after 9/11, I was given a CD by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which included its rendition of ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' I put it in my car's CD player and played that song over and over, often singing along as I drove. It wasn't only the patriotism it evoked that stirred me, but the sense of national unity. That song was what the choir sang at the close of the memorial service at the National Cathedral right after 9/11. Even though that was such a wrenching moment for our nation, I look back on it now with a certain longing and nostalgia. For it was such a moment of American solidarity, with people rallying to people and everyone rallying to the president.</p> <p>And that is what makes me so sad about this moment. It appears we are on the verge of going to war in a way that will burst all the national solidarity and good will that followed 9/11, within our own country and the world.</p>
['taxation', 'reform and reorganization']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin abolished Russia's border guards, its tax police and a clutch of other agencies today and handed their duties to cabinet-level departments, apparently in a move to streamline and get a firmer grip on his labyrinthine bureaucracy.</p> <p>He also announced the creation of a new independent agency to combat illegal narcotics, saying that ''we cannot claim or consider that government bodies are acting effectively enough and in a coordinated manner in this very important sphere.''</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Although war seemed only days or even hours away, European leaders made last-ditch calls today for a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis, saying that they wanted to do everything possible to avert a war.</p> <p>Few, however, entertained strong hopes that efforts to avert a war had much chance of succeeding.</p>

['foreign aid', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States is battling France, Russia and others in Europe over American efforts to try to curb the role of the United Nations in governing and rebuilding a postwar Iraq, and once again Britain, Washington's staunchest ally in the drive toward Baghdad and the diplomatic war that preceded it, is trying to play the role of mediator.</p> <p>The British prime minister, Tony Blair, who arrived here this evening for meetings with President Bush, has said he wants to use this trip to press Washington to accept some kind of United Nations blessing for the occupation, even though the Security Council failed to approve a resolution on the war this month.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>France and Russia made clear today that they were ready to use their veto power to block passage of a new Security Council resolution authorizing force against Iraq, but Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the United States would go to war without United Nations backing if necessary.</p> <p>Meeting in Paris, the foreign ministers of France, Russia and Germany issued a statement saying they would not ''let a proposed resolution pass that would authorize the use of force.'' [Text, Page A16.]</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The declaration issued today by Germany, Russia and France against war in Iraq now -- with its implicit threat of veto -- may go down as the loudest ''No!'' shouted across the Atlantic in a half century or more.</p> <p>The nine-paragraph statement may not have slowed the seemingly inexorable drive by the Bush administration to commence military operations as early as next week.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Following is the text of a joint statement by Foreign Ministers Dominique de Villepin of France, Ivan S. Ivanov of Russia and Joschka Fischer of Germany, as translated by the French Foreign Ministry:</p> <p>Our common objective remains the full and effective disarmament of Iraq, in compliance with Resolution 1441.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The White House said today that Russian companies were supplying Iraq with sophisticated military equipment for use against the United States and that President Bush had pressed President Vladimir V. Putin during a phone call this morning to crack down on them immediately.</p> <p>Administration officials said the United States had been pressuring Russia for almost a year to end what American intelligence has identified as sales of three types of equipment to Iraq: night vision goggles, antitank guided missiles and devices that can jam satellite-based navigation systems used to guide weapons to their targets.</p>
['law and legislation', 'elections', 'computers and the internet', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A new Constitution that affirms Chechnya'a status as a part of the Russian federation was approved by almost 96 percent of voters in a referendum on Sunday, based on partial returns, Chechnya officials said today.</p> <p>The returns, from 255 of Chechnya's 416 polling places, were hailed by President Vladimir V. Putin as proof that civilians in the breakaway Russian republic overwhelmingly support ending a 43-month-old war for independence led by Islamic separatist guerrillas.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>France has promised to veto the U.S.-British-Spanish resolution to end Saddam Hussein's manipulation of the U.N. Two other veto-bearing members of the Security Council, Russia and China, are expected to join in protecting Iraq from being forced to disarm.</p> <p>President Bush has made it clear he will call for the vote that will expose the council as unwilling to protect the world from blackmail by terrorist states with ultimate weapons.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told a large group of American supporters of Israel tonight that Israel faced ''difficult choices'' in making peace and that as terrorism by Palestinians subsided, Jewish ''settlement activity'' in the West Bank and Gaza must end.</p> <p>Speaking to an annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as Aipac, Mr. Powell also gave a vigorous defense of the Bush administration's support for a peace plan drafted over the past year by the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>I never made it higher than corporal, but it doesn't take a military genius to figure out the strategy when you have air supremacy: break the back of the enemy's armor and its infantry before your big ground assault. A month's bombing worked in the last gulf war and a couple of weeks should ''degrade'' the Iraqi Army again.</p> <p>Here is a baker's dozen of my snap judgments about this war:</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>In a sharp rebuff to European allies, Russia and the United Nations, the Bush administration has decided not to put forth a plan for a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians until after the crisis in Iraq is resolved, administration officials say.</p> <p>Negotiations aimed at drafting a three-year-long, step by step ''road map'' leading to the creation of a Palestinian state have been under way between the United States and these partners for nearly a year, but the administration has come under increasing pressure of late to adopt and publish the plan formally as the likelihood of a war with Iraq has risen.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>''Relevance'' has become the buzzword of the Iraqi crisis. From the president on down, leading Bush administration officials have declared that if the United Nations, as it approaches the age of 58, cannot decide to make its authority felt on Iraq, it may as well resign itself to being a debating society, albeit one with a $1.45 billion annual budget.</p> <p>Even ardent internationalists worry that the institution finds itself in a lose-lose situation -- ridiculed as a puppet if American pressure forces a reluctant Security Council majority to support a war against Saddam Hussein, or reduced once more to a self-absorbed cipher if France, Russia and Germany lead the Security Council to thumb its nose at the world's superpower.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Iraq today resumed destroying its short-range Al Samoud 2 missiles and, apparently in a further attempt to exploit the deep divisions among the world's powers over war, issued a defiant list of demands to the United Nations.</p> <p>Glossing over the negative aspects of the latest report by the weapons inspectors, a government statement issued from a meeting presided over by Saddam Hussein and editorials in the government-controlled press all reached the same conclusion: that Iraq had been declared sufficiently free of weapons of mass destruction to warrant the cancellation of sanctions imposed after the 1991 Persian Gulf war.</p>
['children and youth']	<p>As women walked with bouquets of flowers, gifts from the men in their lives on this Women's Day, a small group of friends here in Russia's northern industrial and cultural center were celebrating in a different way.</p> <p>Two were sitting in a smoke-filled art-scene cafe watching the film ''I Shot Andy Warhol,'' about the radical American feminist Valerie Solanis. Another was home with her children. Still another was painting banners for a demonstration to remind residents what the Russian observance of International Women's Day -- a national holiday here since Soviet times -- is really about.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'treaties']	<p>The Senate unanimously approved a treaty with Russia today that requires both countries to reduce their arsenals of deployed strategic nuclear weapons to below 2,200 warheads each over the next 10 years.</p> <p>The pact now goes to President Bush, who planned to sign it, according to the White House. The Russian Parliament has yet to act on the treaty.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>President Bush prepared the country tonight for possibly imminent military action against Iraq, declaring that Saddam Hussein posed a direct threat to the security of the United States and insisting ''we really don't need anybody's permission'' to defend the United States.</p> <p>He said that only days remained for a diplomatic solution and vowed that he would press for a vote on a new resolution at the United Nations in the next few days, even if it appeared that he could not muster a majority 9 of the 15 votes on the Security Council, and despite a French and Russian threat of veto. A defeat would not deter him, he said, from disarming Mr. Hussein.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>When President Bush stepped up to his White House lectern tonight, it was the first time in 18 months, and the second time in his presidency, that he had held a prime-time news conference in the classical splendor of the East Room.</p> <p>The timing was no accident: Mr. Bush agreed to the news conference this morning, 24 hours after the French and Russian foreign ministers declared that they were ready to use their vetoes in the United Nations Security Council to stop an American-led attack on Iraq.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>After Russia's abrupt pledge on Wednesday to veto any United Nations authorization to invade Iraq, experts and politicians here are saying the White House fundamentally misread its ability to pressure the Kremlin into backing a war it fears will be ruinous to its own interests.</p> <p>Some cast that misreading as a consequence of American ''arrogance,'' a word suddenly much in vogue here. They also suggested that the United States was overdue a comeuppance after years of steamrolling Russian objections to things like the NATO air war against Yugoslavia, the junking of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the expansion of NATO and the basic tenets of a nuclear-weapons pact Russia grudgingly signed in May.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin responded to American concerns about alleged sales by Russian companies of sophisticated military equipment to Iraq, calling the accusations ''unsubstantiated.'' Mr. Putin dismissed the concerns, which had been expressed in a telephone call between him and President Bush on Monday, and said they were ''capable of inflicting damage on relations between the two countries,'' Mr. Gromov said. Bush administration officials have said they have been pressing Russia to end what American intelligence has said were sales to Iraq of night-vision goggles, antitank guided missiles and devices that can jam satellite-based navigation systems by Russian companies. The Kremlin raised concerns of its own: Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov, at a briefing at a Russian nuclear site on Monday, said Russian intelligence had found that a British-Dutch company called Urenco had sold uranium-enriching equipment to Iran.</p> <p>Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)</p>
['frauds and swindling']	<p>The British police said today that they had arrested the self-exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky to start legal proceedings that could lead to his eventual extradition to Moscow to face fraud charges brought by the Russian authorities.</p> <p>The arrest illuminated the change in Mr. Berezovsky's fortunes since the 1990's, when he ranked among the most influential of so-called oligarchs at the Kremlin, engineering the destiny of presidents.</p>

['public opinion', 'russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush's ultimatum to Saddam Hussein drew stinging criticism from France and Germany today, with President Jacques Chirac denouncing the decision to resort to war as illegal and wrongheaded.</p> <p>In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered an impassioned defense of his alliance with Mr. Bush but faced a major revolt in his Labor Party as Parliament engaged in a daylong debate over going to war with Iraq.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A Russian news Web site has published a report claiming that two former top Soviet military officers visited Iraq less than two weeks before the start of war to advise the Iraqi military leadership.</p> <p>The report, posted Wednesday on the www.gazeta.ru Internet site, showed three photographs of the two former Soviet generals receiving an award from Iraq's defense minister, Sultan Hashem Ahmed.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'foreign aid', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Nine days after President Bush presented Congress with the first bill for the war in Iraq, the House and Senate approved the cost tonight, voting to spend nearly $79 billion on the war and related needs for foreign aid and domestic security. The Senate's vote was unanimous; the House vote was 414 to 12.</p> <p>The broad consensus on finding money for the Iraq campaign, however, did not extend to supporting the administration's plans for domestic security and foreign aid. The votes were delayed into the evening by testy debates on aid to Turkey, which was opposed by a vocal group of conservative Republicans in the House, and on Democratic proposals to spend billions more on security aid to states and cities.</p>

['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>France has embarked on a two-track strategy to adjust to the harsh reality that it will have to pay a steep price for opposing the war against Iraq, French officials and analysts say.</p> <p>The severity of the long-term damage to relations with the United States is only beginning to be grasped. Senior French officials visiting Washington on non-Iraq issues in recent weeks said they were stunned when their American counterparts informed them of official ''resentment and anger'' against France, one official said. A French official was told bluntly by a White House official, ''I have instructions to tell you that our relations have been degraded.''</p>

['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>The Security Council today stepped back from a potential standoff over North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty that prohibits it from developing nuclear weapons, as China signaled its openness to ''promote political dialogue'' and the United States eased off its pursuit of a formal statement of condemnation.</p> <p>Both the Chinese and American actions represented discreet pullbacks from earlier positions taken after the International Atomic Energy Agency referred the question of North Korea's nuclear program to the Security Council two months ago.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>It is almost certain that the toppling yesterday of Saddam Hussein's giant statue in the center of Baghdad will be considered in retrospect as one of the iconic images of the present war in Iraq. As I watched this scene unfolding on television, similar episodes from the not-so-distant yet already faintly hazy past, sprang to my mind.</p> <p>First, of course, there was the 1989 demolition of the Berlin Wall, which for years divided Germany into the socialist East and the capitalist West. Watching that evening unfold on TV, one could feel the almost palpable physical excitement as youthful drunks madly clawed and hammered away at the hated symbol of this enforced division.</p>

If lawmakers approve, the international peace plan is expected to be formally introduced by the United States a day or so later.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>A meeting of the leaders of Russia and Germany planned for this weekend acquired a sudden new cast late today when President Jacques Chirac of France said he would attend the session, and suggested that the situation in postwar Iraq would top the agenda.</p> <p>The announcement raised the prospect of another bitter split over Iraq among the three nations and the United States and Britain, this time centering on whether the United Nations should take the lead in governing and rebuilding the country once the war has ended.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Nearly two dozen Russian diplomats and journalists, including Russia's ambassador to Iraq, came under attack twice today as they were leaving Baghdad in an automobile convoy, Russian and American officials said.</p> <p>At least five were wounded, and some Russian and Arab broadcast reports tonight said that the Russian ambassador to Iraq, Vladimir Titorenko, was among them. None of the injuries were life-threatening, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The clash between American and North Korean negotiators this week reminded me of another push to get rid of nuclear weapons: not the 1994 talks with North Korea, which did not succeed in the end, but those with Ukraine, which did. After months at the table with Russia and the United States, the Ukrainians let their 1,900 warheads go to Russia for destruction.</p> <p>Although no one expected this week's talks to go smoothly, I sometimes hear that the Ukrainian accord is irrelevant to North Korea because it was a cakewalk. But as an architect of the Ukraine accord, I don't remember it that way. At the time, the Ukrainian Parliament was full of deputies who were determined to hold on to the country's leftover Soviet weapons, to protect themselves from Russia. Former Soviet Rocket Forces officers were swearing allegiance to their new country and claiming they could run an independent nuclear arsenal.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>''The best defense is a good offense.'' That favorite saying of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey gets a half-million hits on Google, including George Washington in 1799: ''Offensive operations, often times, is the surest, if not the only means of defence.''</p> <p>That's the essence of our new policy of pre-emption as a last resort. If threatened by a regime harboring terrorists or likely to provide them with mass-murder weaponry, the U.S. will not wait to gain world sympathy as the victim, but will defend itself by striking first.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Bush administration plans to ask the United Nations to lift international penalties against Iraq in phases, retaining United Nations supervision of Iraq's oil sales for now but transferring other parts of its economy to a new Iraqi authority in coming months, administration officials said today.</p> <p>The officials said that instead of a single Security Council resolution to lift sanctions on Iraq, the United States would seek three or four resolutions over several months, gradually turning over parts of the economy to an Iraqi authority assembled with American guidance.</p>
['foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>The United States and the six other major industrial nations that make up the Group of 7 called today for a new United Nations Security Council resolution that would give approval for international institutions and other governments to help rebuild Iraq.</p> <p>As the size and scope of the task becomes clear, the Bush administration has solicited both money and expertise from wealthy nations and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for the reconstruction of Iraq, and asked creditor nations to forgive the country's debts.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>BY the Bush administration's reckoning last month, the cost of waging the war against Iraq will run about $62 billion. By contrast, the cost of rebuilding that country afterward is estimated at only $3.6 billion.</p> <p>For those who argue that the United States is either being stingy or unrealistic about the postwar costs, administration officials have invoked an analogy of the supply-side economic philosophy that they are using to sell tax cuts at home.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Why do you suppose France and Russia  nations that for years urged the lifting of sanctions on oil production of Saddam's Iraq -- are now preventing an end to those U.N. sanctions on free Iraq?</p> <p>Answer: the Chirac-Putin bedfellowship wants to maintain control of the U.N.'s oil-for-food program, under which Iraq was permitted to sell oil and ostensibly use the proceeds to buy food and medicine for its people. (In reality, Saddam skimmed a huge bundle and socked it away in Swiss, French and Asian banks.)</p>
['russia-international relations-us', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>President Bush's national security adviser met with President Vladimir V.

['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Vladimir V. Putin talked here for two hours today about postwar Iraq, but the session ended with Mr. Putin seemingly still far from London and Washington on the crucial question of the United Nations' role in rebuilding the country.</p> <p>At a sometimes terse news conference after the meeting, Mr. Putin repeated his earlier insistence that United Nations sanctions against Iraq could not be lifted until the country had been certified free of unconventional weapons. Only United Nations weapons inspectors could reliably certify that, he added.</p>

Boucher, the State Department spokesman. He said that in every instance cited by Mr. Gingrich, the department ''is here to carry out the president's policy.''</p>

Chirac and his new ally, Vladimir Putin, let it be known they would refuse to lift U.N. sanctions on the sale of Iraqi oil.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush's national security adviser said today that the American-led alliance had shed ''life and blood'' in the Iraq war and would reserve for itself -- and not the United Nations -- the lead role in creating a new Iraqi government.</p> <p>In declaring that the United Nations would have a secondary role in reconstructing Iraq and leading the country toward eventual elections, the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, seemed certain to fuel the latest trans-Atlantic dispute between the Bush administration and its traditional allies.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>As part of a sweeping crackdown on organized crime after the assassination of the country's prime minister on March 12, Serbian authorities said today that they would issue an arrest warrant for Mirjana Markovic, the wife of former President Slobodan Milosevic.</p> <p>Mrs. Markovic, who is thought to be hiding in Russia, was a political power in her own right, and is the leader of the iconoclastic Yugoslav Left political party. She is suspected of ordering the killing in August 2000 of a Communist-era Serbian president, Ivan Stambolic, a onetime political rival of her husband.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Heads of the three nations that led opposition to the war in Iraq called today for a broad effort under United Nations control to rebuild the shattered country but warned that the immediate tasks of quelling anarchy and preventing a civil catastrophe fell on the United States and Britain.</p> <p>Speaking after a meeting here, the leaders of Russia, Germany and France largely sought to fill in their deep split with Washington and London over the war, acknowledging that the apparent downfall of Saddam Hussein was, taken alone, good for Iraq.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>A top Russian diplomat said today that a nuclear-armed North Korea was against Russian national interests and that the Kremlin would re-evaluate its opposition to international penalties should the North Koreans develop nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The statements, by Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov, who was the Kremlin's emissary to North Korea during a diplomatic mission in January, amounted to a warning to North Korea that patience was ebbing in one of the few nations that has offered it sympathy during a five-month nuclear crisis with the United States.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Administration officials are turning to a gathering of the world's financial ministers to help pay for the rebuilding of Iraq. But they are discovering that without a stamp of approval from the United Nations, they are fighting an uphill battle.</p> <p>While the pleas for aid have been greeted positively, the administration is running into a familiar problem. Foreign institutions and foreign governments say they may need approval from the United Nations Security Council before they give or lend money to Iraq while it is under military occupation.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Bush's call to lift economic sanctions against Iraq could mean the end of the United Nations oil-for-food program, which has overseen the country's oil sales since 1996. Not only are France and Russia likely to object, but they may well support efforts by Secretary General Kofi Annan to modify the oil-for-food system, which is due to expire on May 12, and give it a large role in rebuilding the country. Whatever Mr. Annan's reasons for wanting to reincarnate the operation, before he makes his case there's something he needs to do: open the books.</p> <p>The oil-for-food program is no ordinary relief effort. Not only does it involve astronomical amounts of money, it also operates with alarming secrecy. Intended to ease the human cost of economic sanctions by letting Iraq sell oil and use the profits for staples like milk and medicine, the program has morphed into big business. Since its inception, the program has overseen more than $100 billion in contracts for oil exports and relief imports combined.</p>

['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Dropping its previous opposition, the Russian government gave a green light today to plans for a privately owned oil pipeline to Murmansk that would carry oil bound for the United States.</p> <p>Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told his government to begin preparing a feasibility study for the $4.5 billion project, which also involves building a new loading terminal at Murmansk, a port on the Barents Sea formerly reserved largely for military use. The energy minister, Igor Yusufov, said flatly that the government would not oppose full private ownership of the pipeline, an aspect that officials had balked at just a few months ago.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Israel will propose more than a dozen changes to a Middle East peace initiative, and is prepared to walk away from negotiations if the amendments are rejected, a top aide to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said today.</p> <p>The aide, Dov Weisglass, said most of Israel's concerns centered on ending Palestinian attacks and establishing Palestinian security forces committed to halting violence.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'public opinion', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>It is fitting that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is welcoming President Bush to his hometown of St. Petersburg. An imperial backdrop makes sense for two men creating empires of the 21st century. When Peter the Great built his city 300 years ago, he had two somewhat contradictory purposes in mind. He wanted to showcase Russia's world-power status, but he also wanted to create a ''window to Europe.'' (Europe's hand would poke through, pulling Russia into a more modern era.) The question is which of the two St. Petersburgs Mr. Bush will focus on: the gold-encrusted imperial capital, or the portal to the West and its values of human rights and liberal democracy.</p> <p>My guess is that he'll pick the first, because that's the one President Putin wants him to see. Gone are the days when American presidents stood up to their Russian counterparts and openly pressed them to bring about democratic reform. Now relations at the top are largely about personal friendship. Diplomacy is tied to personality. Bill Clinton related to Russia largely in terms of his relationship with Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Bush has followed suit, making American policy a hostage to his personal attachment to Mr. Putin.</p>
['elections', 'social conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'ethics', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>When President Vladimir V. Putin meets President Bush in St. Petersburg on Saturday, more than a few questions will be asked about how Russia's steely leader opposed a hyperpower over the war in Iraq and came away unscathed.</p> <p>The answer lies somewhere between Mr. Bush's evident personal regard for the Russian leader and Mr. Putin's skill in playing his hand on the world stage. Yet for all his stature abroad, Mr. Putin is looking increasingly vulnerable at home, facing growing fears that his dominance of the state machinery has peaked.</p>
['russia-international relations-us']	<p>Last month Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain traveled to Moscow to discuss postwar Iraq with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Although the war was effectively over, Mr. Putin remained skeptical of its aims. ''Where is Saddam?'' Mr. Putin asked at a press conference after the meeting. Where, he continued, were the weapons of mass destruction, ''if they really existed?''</p> <p>This weekend, President Bush is scheduled to meet with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg. He might face a similarly rude awakening.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The final American concessions on the resolution to end nearly 13 years of sanctions against Iraq won the support of France, Russia and Germany today, ensuring the overwhelming approval of the measure, which is set for a vote on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The measure grants the United States and Britain an extraordinary amount of authority over Iraq's political and economic affairs until a representative, internationally recognized government is installed. The resolution would give a limited but independent role to a United Nations special representative to help the occupying powers and Iraqi groups create a new government.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'medicine and health']	<p>Russia urged its airlines today to halt flights to and from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan and crimped entries along the 2,624-mile Chinese border after the authorities said they had tentatively logged the nation's first known case of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.</p> <p>But conflicting orders from federal and local officials made it difficult to determine how vigorously Russia was moving to curtail the spread of the illness, or even whether a coordinated effort existed.</p>
['medicine and health', 'foreign aid']	<p>President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will have much to discuss when they sit down in St. Petersburg today: Iraq, terrorism, nuclear arsenals, NATO expansion. It is vital, however, that they also address Russia's mounting health crisis.</p> <p>As Mr. Putin has pointed out in two of his four state of the union messages, Russia faces shocking demographic trends. For every 10 babies born, 17 Russians die. The government predicts that the population will decrease 30 percent to 40 percent by 2050. And even these dismal figures may be too optimistic, as they are based on Western European models of public health and not the Russian reality of widespread substance abuse and tuberculosis and pending AIDS epidemics.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today outlined an unusually bleak vision of a country mired in poverty, strangled by bureaucracy and facing ominous threats from inside and out. Going into election season here, he offered, as an answer, an unusually ambitious platform of economic expansion, governmental reforms and military modernization, including the development of new nuclear weapons.</p> <p>Delivering his third annual address to lawmakers in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin portrayed Russia as standing at a crossroads, past the tumultuous transition to capitalism but still unable to compete against the ''highly developed'' nations which ''we see around us.''</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Moving away from Germany's near-total opposition to American policy on Iraq, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder said today that he wanted to reach an agreement on the Security Council resolution being pressed by Britain and the United States.</p> <p>The resolution would lift economic sanctions on Iraq and give the United States and Britain broad authority to administer the country in the aftermath of the war.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>For Poland, these have been heady times. Not since this country liberated itself from Soviet control has it adopted so visible a role on the world stage, or one so defiant of the wishes of its most powerful future partners in the European Union, which Poland is scheduled to join next year.</p> <p>Last week produced the historically arresting spectacle of a Polish defense minister, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, inviting his German counterpart, Peter Struck, to contribute troops to the Polish-led force that the United States foresees guaranteeing security in Iraq. It was an invitation that the Germans summarily, even angrily, dismissed.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>After months of cold war with the United Nations, the United States put forth a draft resolution last week to give the international body oversight of efforts to rebuild Iraq. Although this might help the United Nations gain back some credibility, Washington's effort was clearly intended as a peace offering to its former ''Old Europe'' allies. While the offer is certainly genuine, it is unlikely to thaw relations with Russia, France, Germany and Turkey. The problem is that the Bush administration, while ostensibly trying to get its traditional friends on board, continues to dissemble about where the train is headed.</p> <p>To understand the problem, one has to consider what the Europeans were presented with in the build-up to war. Beyond polemics and misgivings, the basic problem was that Washington's stated war goals were not logically coherent, and its more intellectually compelling arguments were usually played down or denied.</p>
['elections', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'law and legislation', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>As the death toll from a truck bombing in Chechnya on Monday rose steadily higher, President Vladimir V. Putin drew a direct parallel today between that attack and those that occurred in Saudi Arabia only hours later.</p> <p>While Mr. Putin has previously accused international terrorist groups of fueling Chechnya's separatist movement, he used the timing of the attacks -- and the occasion of a meeting with NATO ambassadors here today -- to portray Russia's war in Chechnya as part of a global war against terrorism.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'public opinion', 'elections', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>May Day would not be May Day without revelry and political marches on the streets of Russia's capital. But how to account for the upside-down, inside-out scene that played out in downtown Moscow today?</p> <p>In sunlit Pushkin Square, thousands gathered to hear a leading figure of the Kremlin's wholly owned-and-operated political party, United Russia, denounce President Vladimir V. Putin's government as a tool of business moguls and its economic and social policies as ''a disgrace.''</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'crime and criminals', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>President Bush declared tonight that the military phase of the battle to topple Saddam Hussein's government was ''one victory in a war on terror that began on Sept. 11th, 2001, and still goes on.''</p> <p>Speaking from the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln before thousands of uniformed sailors and aviators as the ship approached San Diego Harbor, he argued that by vanquishing Mr. Hussein's government, he had removed ''an ally of Al Qaeda,'' and he vowed to continue to search for banned weapons in Iraq -- a search that so far has been largely unsuccessful -- and to confront any other nations that use such weapons to threaten the United States or could sell them to terrorists.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, seeking to heal relations bruised by the war in Iraq, has written to President Bush seeking cooperation ''on all levels,'' a senior Russian official said today.</p> <p>The letter, delivered by Defense Minister Sergei B.

['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The United States and Britain won an international mandate today to occupy and rebuild Iraq, as the Security Council voted to end nearly 13 years of sanctions. It was a significant diplomatic victory for the Bush administration, as France, Germany and Russia, the principal opponents of the American-led war, lined up in support of the measure.</p> <p>The resolution passed by a 14-to-0 vote this morning while the chair set aside for Syria, the lone Arab nation on the Council, remained empty. This afternoon, the Syrian chargé d'affaires, Fayssal Mekdad, said at a later Council meeting that his government would have voted for the measure had it more time to deliberate.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>After weeks of pointed Russian protests over the war in Iraq, President Vladimir V. Putin and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell declared today that Russia and the United States had overcome their recent differences. They then met in the Kremlin and failed to resolve some of the most contentious of those, involving the future of Iraq.</p> <p>Mr. Powell, emerging from the meeting tonight with the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said the two countries still had ''outstanding issues'' over Iraq. Those included the return of international weapons inspectors and the terms of a new United Nations resolution giving the United States and its allies broad control to govern postwar Iraq.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>When President Bush travels to St. Petersburg early next month, he will again urge President Vladimir Putin to stop supplying Iran with the means to develop nuclear weapons. Putin will insist, as usual, that his dangerous trade is all for peaceful purposes.</p> <p>Bush will seem to tolerate that. Further, he will pretend to forget the Russian's last-ditch support in the U.N. of Saddam's tyranny. That's what passes for diplomacy.</p>
['terrorism', 'elections']	<p>The long-deferred publication today of a plan to create a Palestinian state side-by-side with Israel plunges President Bush back into direct involvement in the Middle East peace effort -- and into some tough choices that his aides admit he has avoided for at least a year.</p> <p>In engaging himself again in trying to settle the often intractable conflict, Mr. Bush must address the opposing demands of Arab leaders and of his own political base, which includes evangelical Christians and politically conservative Jews. Supporters of the Palestinians want more pressure on Israel, while many of Mr. Bush's conservative backers do not want him to beat up on Israel as an election approaches.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Following is the text of a peace plan for the Middle East by the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, as provided yesterday by the State Department:</p> <p>The following is a performance-based and goal-driven road map, with clear phases, timelines, target dates and benchmarks aiming at progress through reciprocal steps by the two parties in the political, security, economic, humanitarian and institution-building fields, under the auspices of the Quartet. The destination is a final and comprehensive settlement of the Israel-Palestinian conflict by 2005, as presented in President Bush's speech of June 24, and welcomed by the E.U., Russia, and the U.N. in the July 16 and Sept. 17 Quartet ministerial statements.</p>

['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Where are Iraq's weapons of mass destruction? It's a good question, and unfortunately we don't yet have a good answer. There is hope that the capture of Abid Hamid Mahmoud al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's closest aide, will provide the first solid clues. In any event, the mystery will be solved in good time; the search for Iraq's nonconvential weapons program has only just begun.</p> <p>In the meantime, accusations are mounting that the Bush administration made up the whole Iraqi weapons threat to justify an invasion. That is just not the case -- America and its allies had plenty of evidence before the war, and before President Bush took office, indicating that Iraq was retaining its illegal weapons programs.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>When President Bush and the other Group of 8 leaders gather to discuss the world's problems on Sunday and Monday, they will no doubt be hoping that this trim spa on the shores of Lake Geneva will be the source of something more than just cold bubbling spring water.</p> <p>Their host, President Jacques Chirac of France, will press them to turn their attention from terrorism, Iraq and the Middle East to restarting a process of helping less developed regions of the world, most notably Africa.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush's aerobic seven-day, six-nation trip, which ended today with a visit to American troops here, took him from the concentration camp sites of Poland to the czars' palaces of St. Petersburg, a global economic conference in the French Alps and Middle East peacemaking on the edge of the Red Sea. For a president who does not love to travel, the trip was Clintonian -- two countries nearly every day and a new bed to sleep in most nights.</p> <p>By the time Mr. Bush rallied the troops this morning at the United States Central Command forward headquarters in the 115-degree moonscape here, the victor in the war on Iraq was clearly on a high, pumped up by the palpable sense in both Europe and the Middle East that the American president had new powers to wield.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>A woman blew up a bus carrying military workers to a Russian air base west of Chechnya early today as it paused at a railroad crossing, killing at least 18 people, many of them women, and herself. The attack wounded perhaps 15 more.</p> <p>It was the third suicide bombing in the region in just over three weeks, as well as the third in which a woman was either the bomber or a participant. The bombings have belied Russian officials' efforts to portray Chechnya as settling into a more peaceful state following a Moscow-run referendum on March 23 in which most voters were said by the Kremlin to have approved a political structure that would firmly deny Chechnya the independence sought by rebels.</p>
['foreign aid', 'foreign investments', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that they had put their differences over Iraq behind them, and they pointed to new energy deals that will make Britain the world's largest foreign investor in Russia.</p> <p>In a joint news conference capping a four-day state visit to Britain by the Russian leader, the two men traded assurances that their public disagreements about the war were a thing of the past and would not undermine future cooperation.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>For months, local residents say, the group of 15 Arab and Central Asian fighters lived quietly in a two-story house here, among the hundreds of guerrillas who had turned this wooded vale near the Russian border into a burgeoning center of Islamic militancy.</p> <p>Like many of those who gathered here, the fighters had come over the snowy passes from Chechnya, where they had been helping their fellow Muslims in their struggle to break with the Russian republic. They exercised to stay in shape and went into the woods to practice shooting. Some of the militants departed, presumably for Russia, while new ones came to prepare for the fight.</p>
['news and news media', 'elections', 'ethics', 'law and legislation']	<p>With a new election season approaching, Russia's politicians have opened a pre-emptive attack on the rollicking, aggressive and, truthfully, at times corrupt political coverage by the nation's newspapers and television and radio stations.</p> <p>Complaining that salacious and dishonest journalism threatened to pervert the democratic process, the lower house of Parliament, the Duma, voted overwhelmingly last week to amend Russia's campaign laws to allow the authorities to shut down news organizations for campaign coverage deemed to be biased.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The big handshake between the trans-Atlantic odd couple, President Bush and President Jacques Chirac of France, finally happened here this hot and muggy Sunday afternoon on the shores of Lake Geneva. It was, in the end, both a dramatic letdown and a diplomatic success: decorous, accompanied by polite chatter, but with no glimpse into the feelings of two emotional men.</p> <p>What was far more telling was watching Mr. Bush on a flower-filled terrace of the 19th-century Hôtel Royal -- as Mr. Chirac stayed by his side -- working the room of fellow global power brokers.</p>
['elections']	<p>As the Kremlin inches toward elections in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, the Moscow-appointed head of the government there has proposed giving Chechnya what it has always wanted -- more autonomy.</p> <p>Many Chechens interpreted the move as a way for the local leader, Akhmad Kadyrov, to improve his standing ahead of elections, which the newly created Chechen State Council has set for October.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>The longtime main goal for Paul Werner Wagner, who was 5 years old in 1953 when he marched beside his father in the first workers' uprising in Soviet-controlled Central Europe, has been to make sure that the men and women who suffered and went to prison at that time not be forgotten.</p> <p>''At 17,'' he recalled today, ''I founded a party. It was the Progressive German Freedom Party. We published a 14-point program that was inspired by the 10-point program of June 17, 1953. For that, I spent a year and a half in the Red Ox Prison in Halle.</p>
['espionage', 'crime and criminals']	<p>When Moscow revealed last week that a Russian intelligence officer who had settled in the United States had been lured back home and arrested, the news was the talk of American and Russian veterans of the intelligence battles of the cold war, who viewed the incident as evidence that an old-fashioned spy war has quietly flared anew.</p> <p>Aleksandr Zaporozhsky, a former colonel in the S.V.R., Russia's foreign intelligence service, has been sentenced to 18 years in jail for spying for the United States, Russian officials disclosed last week. Mr. Zaporozhsky had been living in Maryland but in November 2001 was somehow induced to return to Moscow, where he was quietly arrested and jailed.</p>
['public opinion', 'crime and criminals', 'elections', 'television', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'ethics']	<p>State television today featured majestic shots of a compound of brick dachas, an all-weather tennis court and an azure swimming pool -- all built by police colonels with official salaries of about $300 a month.</p> <p>It's election season, cynics say, which means it's time for a televised anticorruption campaign.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'elections']	<p>A truck exploded near a government complex in Chechnya today in what officials said was the fourth suicide bombing in or near the republic in five weeks. At least two people, believed to be suicide bombers, died and several more were wounded, the officials said.</p> <p>The attack occurred this afternoon in the Staropromyslovksy district of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, not far from police headquarters and a regional office of Russia's Interior Ministry.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>With his hands full in Iraq, President Bush has now given nearly identical warnings to Iran and North Korea -- that their efforts to build nuclear weapons will ''not be tolerated'' by the United States -- even while he is pursuing very different strategies to stop them.</p> <p>While the countries are often discussed in tandem as Mr. Bush's most urgent proliferation threats, they present different challenges. Despite Mr. Bush's declaration that the United States would never abide a nuclear North Korea, American intelligence agencies say they believe the country already possesses two weapons, and for the first time it is boasting about its capacity to produce many more. It has rejected the nuclear treaties it once had signed.</p>
['foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin appears to be off to a strong start on his newly announced capitalist plan to double Russia's economy in a decade.</p> <p>In the first five months of this year, Russia's gross domestic product rose 7.1 percent, about double the rate of the comparable period last year. Oil and gas production, the locomotive of modern Russia's economy, is up 11.5 percent. Russia, which exports more oil than any nation except Saudi Arabia, is increasing its oil output this year for the fifth consecutive year.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Polar bears that traverse the floating ice between the Russian Arctic and Alaska are being shot in rising numbers by poachers on Russian shores, according to a new report by federal wildlife biologists in the United States, and the killing could greatly diminish the bear population if it is not slowed.</p> <p>The findings were released as the United States and Russia consider ratifying a treaty they signed in 2000 to protect the shared population of about 4,000 bears. The treaty would allow limited hunting by native populations but would clamp down on poaching under a management plan developed by scientists and representatives of native communities.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>With Iran facing growing pressure to be more forthcoming about its nuclear program, the United Nations top nuclear weapons inspector, the Russian foreign minister and a group of European Union ministers today urged it to sign a protocol that would give inspectors the right to conduct more intrusive examinations of its facilities.</p> <p>The calls came after the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is meeting in Vienna, formally reviewed a recent report that gave new details about Iranian plans for a heavy water research reactor, which could be used in the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Leaders of the major industrialized countries managed to put aside their differences over the American-led war on Iraq today, saying they shared a common interest in rebuilding the nation into a stable democracy.</p> <p>''Our shared objective is a fully sovereign, stable and democratic Iraq, at peace with its neighbors and firmly on the road to progress,'' they said in a statement today.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'ethics', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>A Russian court issued warrants today for the arrest of two men suspected of killing an opposition member of Parliament. It was the second set of arrests this week in the politically charged case.</p> <p>The Russian police had already detained the two men -- Mikhail Kodanev, a member of the Liberal Russia party of the Russian mogul Boris A. Berezovsky, and Mr. Berezovsky's aide, Aleksandr Vinnik -- on Thursday in Kudymkar near Perm, a city in the Ural Mountains. The police say they suspect that the two men organized the killing.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>United States military commanders say foreign fighters are being actively recruited by loyalists to Saddam Hussein to join the resistance against American forces in Iraq, posing a new challenge to efforts to stabilize the country.</p> <p>Military officials say that American troops in Iraq have had to contend with Syrians, Saudis, Yemenis, Algerians, Lebanese and even Chechens.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>At first, investors shrugged off the series of raids on the periphery of the empire of Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, as just a passing unpleasantness. Now, as the wrangle drags into its fourth week, investors are starting to worry.</p> <p>Russian authorities began a series of investigations against allies and companies of Mr. Khodorkovsky in the three weeks beginning July 2. The charges include fraud, tax evasion and even murder.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>China and Russia sought today to delay a Security Council condemnation of North Korea's nuclear arms program, a day after a top North Korean general said any sanctions or blockades initiated by the United States would be considered a ''complete breach'' of the truce that ended hostilities on the peninsula 50 years ago.</p> <p>The letter added that if the United States took such actions, the North Korean army would ''immediately take strong and merciless retaliatory measures'' and promised that ''horrible disasters'' would befall the South Korean population.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In the quiet of the Russian summer, a noisy political brawl is rewriting the rules of Russian politics.</p> <p>During the past two weeks, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man and one of its most powerful, has watched as federal prosecutors hit his oil company and his allies with a flurry of criminal charges, including theft of state property, tax evasion and even murder. In a piece of Russian-style police theatrics, masked officers toting automatic weapons raided his office archives.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In a political wrangle of a kind not seen in Russia since the early days of Vladimir V. Putin's presidency, the authorities have arrested a top executive at the financial group that owns Russia's largest oil company.</p> <p>The executive, Platon Lebedev, chairman of Menatep, the company that owns 61 percent of the Yukos Oil Company, was arrested on Wednesday. The general prosecutor's office suspects him of embezzling from a state company in 1994, a charge he denies. Mr. Lebedev was convalescing in a hospital when arrested and was led out in handcuffs, a Yukos executive said.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Dr. David Kelly, the British microbiologist who committed suicide last week while caught up in a dispute about whether the British government doctored intelligence reports on Iraq's weapons programs, played a key role in Western efforts to uncover biological warfare programs in the former Soviet Union and Iraq.</p> <p>A Oxford-educated scientist who took pride in his status as a civil servant, Dr. Kelly was Britain's leading specialist on biological weapons.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The Bush administration, which spurned the United Nations in its drive to depose Saddam Hussein in Iraq, is finding itself forced back into the arms of the international body because other nations are refusing to contribute peacekeeping troops or reconstruction money without United Nations approval.</p> <p>With the costs of stabilizing Iraq hovering at $4 billion a month and with American troops being killed at a steady rate, administration officials acknowledge that they are rethinking their strategy and may seek a United Nations resolution for help that would placate other nations, like India, France and Germany.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>The day after two suicide bombers killed themselves and at least 13 others at a Moscow rock festival, President Vladimir V. Putin today canceled a planned trip abroad, and his interior minister pledged that those behind the attack ''will be brought to justice and punished.''</p> <p>Mr. Putin's aides insisted that such violence would not derail plans to bring a popularly elected government and a workable peace to Chechnya, the southwestern province whose four-year separatist war appears almost certainly to be tied to the bombings on Saturday.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'finances']	<p>In a closed session today, the Moscow City Court denied bail to a business partner of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man and one of its most powerful.</p> <p>The court rejected an appeal to release the man, Platon Lebedev, on bail. Mr. Lebedev was arrested on July 2 and accused of violating a 1994 privatization program, a charge he denies.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'finances', 'suits and litigation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Yukos Oil Company, Russia's biggest oil producer, today shrugged off legal action against its owners that had cast a cloud over the company. Executives announced strong financial results for the quarter ended March 31 and said they were pushing ahead with plans for a major acquisition.</p> <p>Last week, officers from Russia's general prosecutor's office arrested Platon Lebedev, the chairman of Menatep, the financial group that owns 61 percent of Yukos, in connection with an inquiry into a 1994 privatization deal. Mr. Lebedev is a close ally of the Yukos chief executive, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.</p>
['terrorism', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>It is the one Afghan reconstruction project that President Hamid Karzai did not want to touch. When officials put papers in front of him last year to authorize the refurbishment of Pul-i-Charkhi prison, on the eastern edge of Kabul, he said he could not bring himself to do it and told them to get someone else to sign.</p> <p>Pul-i-Charkhi is one of the blackest holes in the last quarter-century of Afghanistan's war-torn history. During the years of Soviet and Communist control, hundreds of thousands of prisoners passed through the solid stone walls and into the dark concrete cells, and unknown thousands never came out alive, victims of nightly executions on the military range beyond the prison walls.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>Today is the 50th anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the Korean War. The division of the peninsula by two ''liberation'' armies -- both of which seemed to hold it in no special favor -- was an unwelcome gift thrust upon the Korean people, still dazed by the emotions of liberation from Japan in 1945. The intense nuclear anxieties on the Korean Peninsula now demonstrate the lingering effects of this gift.</p> <p>The regimes imposed by the Soviet Union and the United States on North and South Korea at the end of the Second World War evolved quite differently -- and not necessarily in the way Americans assume they did.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov sought to calm anxiety in his country's business community today by publicly stating that Russia would not review the origins of the fortunes made in its much-questioned privatization program.</p> <p>Mr. Kasyanov is the first senior official to publicly address the issue of whether the Kremlin will seek to wrest the fortunes from rich Russians who made their money in a lawless program of state-asset sales in the mid-1990's.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>North Korea declared today that it saw no purpose in continuing nuclear talks with the five nations it met in Beijing this week and was left with no choice but to strengthen its nuclear deterrent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, American officials, responding to the threats North Korea made on Thursday to conduct a nuclear test, said that if the country exploded a nuclear device, President Bush would be forced to press for an economic quarantine, a step North Korea has said would be an act of war.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'bombs and explosives', 'foreign aid']	<p>Using the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad as a rallying cry, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sought today to build support for a new Security Council resolution that would persuade other major nations to contribute more troops and aid to secure and rebuild Iraq under the aegis of the American-led occupation.</p> <p>His appeal was not rejected out of hand by any Council members, but it met with a wary response from Germany and Russia and an icy rebuke from France.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>The United States and North Korea had their first face-to-face meeting in four months here this afternoon as part of six-nation negotiations on how to end North Korea's nuclear program, but diplomats played down prospects for an early breakthrough.</p> <p>James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state, and Kim Yong Il, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, met on the sidelines of formal discussions, breaking a freeze on direct dialogue that began after a stormy meeting in April in which North Korea warned that it was moving quickly to develop and deploy nuclear arms.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Sharp differences emerged today between the top American administrator in Iraq and the country's interim government as the United States sought to calm a city unnerved by the truck bomb that killed 20 people in the United Nations headquarters.</p> <p>Iraqi officials described a tense meeting between L. Paul Bremer III and the Iraqi Governing Council. Mr. Bremer, they said, demanded that the 25-member Council exert more authority, condemn the bombing strongly and communicate better with the Iraqi people.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>Will billions of dollars in aid in exchange for North Korea ending its nuclear weapons program accelerate or reverse grudging free market moves by the world's most Communist nation?</p> <p>As envoys from the United States and Japan, the world's two largest economies, prepare for talks next week with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, economists debate the depth of commitment to market reform in a country that once planned to ban cash.</p>
['accidents and safety']	<p>A helicopter carrying the governor and other senior officials of the Pacific region of Sakhalin disappeared today while flying toward the Kurile Islands. An airborne search for the helicopter was suspended at nightfall, dimming hopes that the helicopter and those aboard would be found safe.</p> <p>There were conflicting reports on the number of people on the helicopter, but a spokeswoman for Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry said tonight that as many as 18 passengers and 3 crew members were believed to have boarded before it took off from an airport on the Kamchatka Peninsula at 2:45 p.m.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Amid signs of growing diplomatic and military isolation, North Korea lashed out at the United States, South Korea and Japan today, barely a week before the scheduled start of international talks on North Korea's nuclear program.</p> <p>Russia, traditionally an ally of North Korea, embarked today on a 10-day maritime exercise, partly in waters near North Korea, that will involve Japan and South Korea, two traditional enemies of the North. The exercise is the first time that warships from those three countries have conducted joint maneuvers.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>I got my car stuck in the mud of a so-called road here. Way back in the 1920's, it was a smooth highway, but it has now disintegrated into a rough path -- and when a bridge collapsed recently, motorists were left to forge through a muddy bog as embracing as quicksand.</p> <p>That's the special accomplishment of the former Soviet Union: it not only repressed and impoverished its citizens in its seven decades, but continues to do so today, posthumously.</p>
['public opinion', 'economic conditions and trends', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>To hear Russian officials, what's happening in Chechnya is not a war: it is a phase in an antiterrorism operation that has reached such a point of ''normalization'' that control was switched last week from the Federal Security Bureau, which handles war operations, to the Interior Ministry. After all, the Russians say, the Chechen people rebuffed the Islamic separatists by voting overwhelmingly in March to remain part of Russia, and they will vote again in October, this time for a Chechen president.</p> <p>Chechens agree -- but in their own way. ''What's happening in this country is not a war,'' they say. ''It is much worse than a war, with many more civilian casualties.'' I hear this repeatedly on buses, in markets and during conversations wherever I travel in this tiny, battered republic. For them, the switch to the Interior Ministry is merely cosmetic -- the soldiers and checkpoints remain -- and the coming election won't be a fair one.</p>
['frauds and swindling']	<p>Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the Russian media baron who has lived in self-exile since fleeing fraud charges here in 2000, has been arrested in Greece and could face extradition to Russia, officials in Greece said today.</p> <p>Mr. Gusinsky, who lost control of the independent NTV network in a corporate takeover two years ago that he said was engineered by the Kremlin to silence political critics, was arrested when he arrived on Thursday at the new international airport east of Athens on a flight from Tel Aviv.</p>
['terrorism', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances', 'biographical information']	<p>Anyone who says America's European allies have no stomach for action has never flown with Norway's defense minister, Kristin Krohn Devold. I might give her this compliment, if only the helicopter we're in weren't plummeting backward.</p> <p>Moments later, we are racing at treetop level toward a Norwegian military base, from which a contingent of mine-clearing troops is about to be dispatched to Iraq, and Devold encourages her pilots to show me what they can do. The chopper banks wildly, veering to the right and left, so that in one instant I am looking straight down at the ground and, in the next, straight up at the sky. The trees are never more than a few yards beneath us.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>North Korea told diplomats from five other nations on Thursday that it planned to declare formally that it has become a nuclear power and may test an atomic bomb in the near future to prove it, according to senior Bush administration officials.</p> <p>The statement by Kim Yong Il, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, appeared to sharply contradict the spirit of the six-party talks organized by China, North Korea's closest ally and leading aid donor, and may buttress the contention of hard-liners in the Bush administration that the reclusive Communist government has no intention of reaching a verifiable agreement to dismantle its nuclear program.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'public opinion', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>President Roh Moo Hyun's approval rating is plummeting, his private secretary has resigned because of a bar hostess scandal, and prosecutors are questioning the president of his party about bribery allegations. But Mr. Roh says he has identified the real problem: the press.</p> <p>''What does it mean, 'engaging reporters?' '' Mr. Roh shouted when a press aide suggested recently that he reach out to the nation's newspapers and broadcasters.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Even though the six nations that gathered for talks here this week have yet to agree on how to stop North Korea's nuclear program, at least one breakthrough was evident: the emergence of China as a more assertive diplomatic power.</p> <p>China cajoled and badgered the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia to join negotiations on how to resolve the Korea arms crisis. It succeeded in pressing participants to commit to another round, despite obvious tensions between the United States and North Korea.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States, North Korea and four other nations ended three days of sometimes fiery negotiations here on Friday and decided to keep talking, as Bush administration officials concluded that the diplomatic track still offered the best hope of resolving the Korean nuclear crisis.</p> <p>Though North Korea repeatedly threatened to test and deploy nuclear weapons if its demands for a nonaggression pact were not met in full, several senior administration officials said the six-party negotiations had in some respects ''exceeded our expectations,'' persuading them to push for a new round soon.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>North Korea and the United States announced today that they had agreed to hold regional talks over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, in a victory for the Bush administration, which resisted 10 months of pressure to hold one-on-one talks with the North.</p> <p>By guaranteeing seats at the table to North Korea's neighbors -- China, Russia, Japan and South Korea -- Washington hopes to draw regional players into a pact that would verify the dismantlement of the North's nuclear weapons program, probably in return for international economic aid and an American promise not to attack North Korea militarily.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'treaties']	<p>Now that the United States and North Korea have finally agreed to talk, the issue is what to talk about. A priority of the Bush administration, as well as its predecessors, has long been the dismantling of the North's nuclear-weapons program. This goal is realistic, but only if the United States is prepared to engage North Korea on a wide range of issues -- especially its failed economy.</p> <p>The structure of the talks -- scheduled for next month, they will include China, Russia, South Korea and Japan -- ensures that the major regional players will be able to emphasize to Pyongyang that its nuclear weapons program must first be frozen and then dismantled entirely. Unfortunately, North Korea probably won't listen to a proposal that requires it to make all the initial concessions. It already had something close to the deal Mr. Bush is now proposing under President Bill Clinton -- but then Pyongyang willfully ignored it and began a secret nuclear program in the late 1990's.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The news that North Korea has agreed to multilateral talks has been greeted with relief and hope from Moscow to Beijing to Washington. The United States has consistently insisted on multilateral talks with the North, while North Korea had been calling for talks only between the United States and North Korea. Now that North Korea has agreed to talks that will include Japan, China, Russia and South Korea, the Bush administration is focusing on the need to dismantle the North's nuclear-weapons program.</p> <p>However, the issue of multilateral versus bilateral talks is only peripheral to the nuclear crisis, and the prospect for resolving the yearlong standoff between the United States and North Korea remains dim. If the United States offers nothing but a demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear program, the meetings will be useless. If there is nothing to discuss, why even meet?</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>North Korea will come under intense diplomatic pressure to scrap its nuclear weapons program on Wednesday as the United States, North Korea and its four neighbors begin unusual six-party negotiations on how to resolve the Korean arms crisis.</p> <p>The talks, scheduled to take place over three days here in the Chinese capital, are the most concerted diplomatic push on North Korea since President Bush took office. They pose a difficult challenge to the administration as it seeks to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions without directly rewarding it for doing so, which Mr. Bush said would be like succumbing to blackmail.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'russia-international relations-us']	<p>International inspectors have found traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian facility, according to a new confidential report distributed today. The traces could be an indication that Tehran has already produced weapons-grade nuclear materials.</p> <p>Iran denied producing nuclear materials, said the report, by the International Atomic Energy Association, the conclusions of which were obtained by The New York Times. The report added, ''Additional work is also required to enable the agency to arrive at conclusions about Iran's statements that there have been no uranium enrichment activities in Iran involving nuclear material.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>The Bush administration said today that North Korea appeared ready to agree to proposed multiparty talks to resolve the impasse over the North's refusal to dismantle its accelerating nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>Administration officials and Asian diplomats said that while no formal word had been received in Washington, there were several indications that months of pressure had been successful in getting North Korea to meet the American demand for talks to include South Korea, Japan and possibly Russia. China took part in discussions with the United States and the North in April.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>Anna N. Aldukhova, 19, stood on a corner of Uprising Square wearing a blue cap and windbreaker that bore the name of the front-runner in this city's approaching gubernatorial runoff. She passed out leaflets promising a better quality of life. No one paid much attention.</p> <p>For a campaign volunteer, she hardly seemed enthusiastic herself. ''People are a little bit tired of promises -- and don't believe any of them anymore,'' she said as men and women bustled by, most of them ignoring her outstretched hand.</p>
['treaties', 'taxation', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The Bush administration announced a trade agreement with Moscow today that could increase American poultry and meat exports to Russia as well as remove some of the obstacles blocking Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization.</p> <p>Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, held a news conference today to trumpet the first piece of good trade news since the breakup this month of world trade talks in Cancún, Mexico.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>For White House planners, the image had to be picture perfect: the first lady, the American flag and the Eiffel Tower all in the same photo frame.</p> <p>So when Laura Bush raised the American flag today to signal the return of the United States to Unesco after a 19-year boycott, there was nothing subtle about the symbols.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'accidents and safety', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'atomic energy']	<p>On Aug. 30, the K-159, a Russian November-class nuclear submarine, sank during bad weather in the Barents Sea, taking with it nine sailors. The K-159, which had been decommissioned by the Russian Navy in 1989, broke loose as it was being towed to the Nerpa dismantling site near Murmansk.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the K-159 accident is symptomatic of a larger malaise plaguing the Russian Navy. More than 30 of Russia's first-generation nuclear submarines are deteriorating, with the most typical problems including hull leaks and the failure of safety systems.</p>

Rapture, they said, awaited those who perished.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>The resurgent Taliban has embarked on a strategy of small guerrilla attacks intended to frustrate and steadily bleed American forces in Afghanistan and to force the United States to expend billions of dollars in military costs, according to two Taliban officials interviewed recently.</p> <p>Hajji Ibrahim, who identified himself as a Taliban commander, said the group's goal was to tie down the United States in Afghanistan and force it to spend huge sums responding to limited attacks that draw American forces ''here to there, here to there.'' He confidently predicted that the United States, sapped by a slow, costly and grinding conflict, would abandon Afghanistan after two to three years, and repeatedly compared the current situation to the defeat of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'elections', 'war and revolution']	<p>It was a surprise the other day in this raw and bleeding city to come across a rock band on the back of a flatbed truck, its loud music echoing through acres of empty, shattered buildings.</p> <p>A cluster of unsmiling men listened patiently in the central plaza. Dozens of soldiers with automatic rifles stood on alert around them.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, pressed by France and by some Iraqis to agree to a speedier timetable toward self-government in Iraq, cautioned here today that the process of restoring sovereignty had to be carried out in stages and that it might not be seen as legitimate if it went too rapidly.</p> <p>Speaking after meetings with leaders of the American-led occupation and with the 25-member Iraqi Governing Council, which was handpicked by American authorities, Mr. Powell also said he had found that more progress was being made in securing and rebuilding Iraq than had been emphasized in news reports, mentioning for example new parent-teacher groups at local schools.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>The United States joined senior envoys from the United Nations, the European Union and Russia today to try to salvage the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. They plan renewed appeals to the Palestinians to stop suicide bombings and other attacks, and to Israel to exercise restraint in cracking down on terrorist groups.</p> <p>Diplomats said the envoys agreed to have the European Union make an urgent new push to press Yasir Arafat to ensure that the designated Palestinian prime minister, Ahmed Qurei, can crack down on Hamas and other groups responsible for bus bombings and other attacks.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Bush welcomed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to Camp David today for another meeting intended to show the two as problem-solvers who work best in informal settings, even as they appear still divided on Iraq and on Russia's continued insistence that its sales of nuclear technology to Iran are benign.</p> <p>The meeting came during a week when the International Atomic Energy Agency has found new evidence that Iran is enriching uranium. Mr. Putin, who expressed doubts two years ago that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons, has begun to concede that Tehran may be doing exactly that -- even while denying that Russian technology is contributing to the effort.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The moment was a small but sweet victory for the Russian oil baron Vagit Y. Alekperov: the Getty gas station he bought in Manhattan three years ago was renamed yesterday after his own huge oil company, Lukoil, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was on hand to ring in the change, coffee cup in one hand and Krispy Kreme doughnut in the other.</p> <p>Mr. Alekperov wanted American consumers to understand that they need Russian oil and that companies like his are ready to provide it. For the last two years, oil has become an increasingly powerful bond between the United States, the world's largest consumer, and Russia, among the largest producers.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The United States needs natural gas. Developing countries many thousands of miles away are willing to supply it. This sleepy beachfront town and other communities along the Gulf of Mexico are likely to become the links between producers and consumers.</p> <p>Altogether, energy companies are planning to spend more than $100 billion in the next decade to bring gas from developing countries to rich nations, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. The only way to do it is to supercool the gas so that it condenses into a liquid, which is then compact enough to load onto tankers and send across oceans.</p>
['budgets and budgeting', 'elections', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Bush administration, seeking new avenues to induce skeptical countries to contribute troops and money in Iraq, circulated a draft Security Council resolution today that would create a multinational force led by the United States and authorized by the United Nations.</p> <p>The proposed draft would also invite the Iraqi Governing Council to develop a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections, ideally leading to the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and the withdrawal of all American and other foreign forces.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'frauds and swindling']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has portrayed the investigations swirling around Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, as an isolated criminal matter that do not signal a wholesale review of the country's privatization of state assets in the 1990's.</p> <p>Making his first direct remarks on the Yukos affair since it erupted in July with the arrest of a major stockholder, Mr. Putin said in an interview with American journalists on Saturday evening that as president he could not interfere with the independence of prosecutors, who he said were simply upholding the law.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that he would send ''a clear but respectful signal to Iran'' that it must comply with international inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons program. But he told President Bush that Russia would go forward with its plans to help Iran build a nuclear reactor.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's statement this morning that he would not terminate Russia's $800 million commercial nuclear contract with Iran came as a brief, and almost cryptic, aside in response to a question at a news conference with Mr. Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp David.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is to go to Geneva this weekend to discuss the American resolution to broaden international involvement in Iraq with Security Council members. Three of them announced today their own proposals to accelerate the transfer of civil authority to Iraqis.</p> <p>The proposed amendments by France, Germany and Russia would expand the United Nations mandate, giving the organization, in cooperation with the interim administration, supervision over when and how Iraqis regain sovereignty.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'religion and churches', 'crime and criminals', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>Last month four senior American government officials traveled to Saudi Arabia to revisit the troubled topic of the desert kingdom's antiterrorism efforts. Unsure of what to expect, the American delegation was pleasantly surprised when a pro forma appointment with Crown Prince Abdullah went on for more than two hours.</p> <p>During the trip the Saudis also committed themselves to carrying out a series of measures to combat terrorism, United States law enforcement and intelligence officials said. Among the actions, Saudi officials said, were a ban on cash contributions in local mosques and the removal of donation boxes for charities from shopping malls. American officials believe that Saudi mosques and charitable organizations are crucial pipelines for terrorist financing.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>As President Bush meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia today and tomorrow at Camp David, he should take the opportunity to chart a new course for Russian-American relations. The logic for such a change is compelling, especially regarding United States interests in Iraq, and it is clear to Russian officials in both government and industry.</p> <p>This new thinking is the product of several factors involving the common experience of Russia and the United States as victims of terrorism and a common interest in nurturing greater stability in the Middle East. The countries' complementary capacities could accelerate the rebuilding of Iraq and help to end the violence there.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'freedom and human rights', 'war and revolution']	<p>Arjan Erkel, a humanitarian aid worker in Dagestan, a Russian republic that borders Chechnya, was kidnapped on the night of Aug. 12, 2002.</p> <p>Mr. Erkel, a 33-year-old Dutch citizen who was leading an effort to provide medical services and other assistance in a region ravaged by war and terror, was seized and driven away by three gunmen. It was later learned that he was also being followed by members of the Russian Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. The agents tailing him did not intervene to prevent the abduction.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The leaders of France, Germany and Britain failed today to make any apparent progress toward a common position on the American draft of a Security Council resolution, which would authorize countries to contribute money and troops in the rebuilding of Iraq.</p> <p>The three held a much anticipated meeting here and agreed afterward that sovereignty should be transferred to an Iraqi civilian authority as soon as possible and that the United Nations should have a key role in that process.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>The Bush administration, incensed by France's demands for greater United Nations oversight in Iraq, is working to isolate France and win a majority at the United Nations Security Council for the American approach, administration officials said today.</p> <p>In an echo of a tactic the administration tried earlier this year, without notable success, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is stepping up his efforts to enlist the support of Russia, Germany and other nations for American control over the occupation and transition to self-rule in Iraq, even though many of them sided with France in opposing the war.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'biographical information']	<p>ELENA NEMIROVSKAYA had a lot of reasons to hate the Soviet Union. It sent her father to a labor camp and forced her mother, an enemy of the state by association, out of her factory job. She survived, in part, by sewing mittens. It mangled her young daughter's health. It terrorized her husband with interrogations.</p> <p>She emerged from Soviet life filled not with hate, but with a ferocious desire to tear the Soviet heart out of the new Russia. Ms. Nemirovskaya, a former art historian, chose to take on one of Russian society's biggest post-Soviet deficiencies: its lack of civic life.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'news and news media']	<p>''The City of Dead Journalists,'' a Moscow newspaper has called this automobile capital on the Volga. Freedom of speech, it seems, is under the gun.</p> <p>For the second time in 18 months, the staff of The Togliatti Review, a newspaper known for muckraking about the deadly post-Soviet intersection of politics, business and organized crime, gathered at a cemetery on Friday to honor an editor in chief who was killed the week before.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>The word here is that Russia's publishing industry is back on its feet, after languishing for years amid the country's economic collapse and political dislocation. But more interesting than that bit of news, perhaps, is that Russia chose the Frankfurt Book Fair, which opened Tuesday, to trumpet its literary comeback.</p> <p>Indeed, the timing and the place are rich in symbolism. The nearly 100 Russian authors who are flocking to this mammoth gathering of agents, publishers and booksellers follow on the heels of political leaders who have cultivated closer ties between Russia and Germany.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Reports that President Vladimir V. Putin's powerful chief of staff resigned in protest over the arrest of the country's richest businessman heightened concern on Wednesday that the Kremlin had gone a step too far in cracking down on him and his oil company, risking capital flight and political instability.</p> <p>Aleksandr S. Voloshin, a quiet but influential figure known as Mr. Putin's ''gray cardinal,'' submitted his resignation on Saturday, the day that masked agents arrested the tycoon, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky aboard his private jet in Siberia, according to published reports and an analyst with ties to the Kremlin.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>In the predawn Siberian darkness five days ago, agents of the Russian security agency stormed the private jet of Russia's richest man. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the chief executive and principal owner of Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, was arrested and charged with tax evasion, fraud, forgery and embezzlement.</p> <p>Mr. Khodorkovsky now awaits his fate in a Moscow prison, where prosecutors can hold him for up to two months while they decide whether to pursue a trial. But his arrest has already raised profound questions for post-Soviet Russia. It has exposed the complex and deep divisions within the elite and the public alike about the nature of state control over the economy, the role of big business in politics and the influence of personal wealth in what still is a poor society.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A vast and remote expanse of green in the heart of Siberia is part of the largest wetland on earth. It produces oxygen at a rate rivaled only by the Amazon. It contains ancient forests, endangered species of beavers and Siberian sturgeon.</p> <p>It also holds oil, lots of it, and environmentalists are warning that a sudden splurge of hurried extraction, along with a virtual absence of government oversight, is changing the face of this delicate wilderness.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid']	<p>China and Russia offered their support on Wednesday for the latest version of the draft Security Council resolution on Iraq's future, putting heavy pressure on Germany and France to vote in favor of the measure, rather than join Syria in abstaining, Council diplomats said.</p> <p>Washington agreed late on Wednesday to postpone the vote until Thursday to give the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, time to try to persuade the French president, Jacques Chirac, and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, to accept the draft, diplomats here said. Mr. Putin was traveling to Kuala Lumpur for a summit meeting of Muslim countries.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush presented President Hu Jintao of China with a new, if still vague, American plan here on Sunday that would provide a five-nation security guarantee to North Korea -- but not a formal nonaggression treaty -- if the North dismantles all of its nuclear weapons programs.</p> <p>Mr. Bush's decision to find a way to provide assurances to North Korea -- over the objections of those in his administration who have made it clear that they do not believe the United States should be negotiating with the North at all -- is a subtle but important shift in his approach to the North Korean nuclear crisis.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'credit', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Following are remarks by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from an interview on Saturday, as transcribed and translated by The New York Times. A more complete version of his remarks is online at nytimes.com/world.</p> <p>I. On the need for an international mandate for the American-led occupation of Iraq:</p> <p>MR. PUTIN -- We think that Iraq's problems can be efficiently solved only with involvement of the Iraqi people themselves. This task has to be solved with their participation and by their hands. But so that it would be efficient they have to believe in our serious intentions, in our desire to restore sovereignty. This is why we think that the U.N.'s role has to be increased -- not because we would like to diminish the significance of the United States, but in order to change the situation in Iraq itself.</p>
['elections']	<p>The Kremlin's hand-picked candidate for president of Chechnya, Ahmad Kadyrov, has secured victory, the election commission chief said Monday. His stage-managed election followed a campaign consisting of threats, violence and manipulation.</p> <p>Speaking as the ballots were still being counted from the vote on Sunday, the commission chief, Abdul-Karim Arsakhanov, said Mr. Kadyrov had already gained more than half the votes, the Interfax news agency reported.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'credit', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'finances', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says the United States now faces in Iraq the possibility of a prolonged, violent and ultimately futile war like the one that mired the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.</p> <p>In an expansive interview on Saturday evening, Mr. Putin warned that Iraq could ''become a new center, a new magnet for all destructive elements.'' He added, without naming them, that ''a great number of members of different terrorist organizations'' have been drawn into the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein. [Excerpts, Page A8.]</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign investments', 'economic conditions and trends', 'crime and criminals', 'stocks and bonds', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>The arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the head of Yukos, the largest oil company in Russia, and the country's richest man, is bound to unnerve even the most stolid of investors in Russia, bankers and market observers say.</p> <p>''Two words,'' predicted one investment banker in Moscow, when asked how he thought investors would react. ''Capital flight.''</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Bush administration is virtually assured of gaining Security Council approval of a revised United Nations resolution on Iraq's future, diplomats here said Tuesday, but it remains unclear whether the measure will be adopted overwhelmingly or in a less convincing, abstention-riddled vote.</p> <p>The resolution, however it passes, will mark an important step in the administration's attempt to gain broader international backing both for the occupation forces in Iraq and the reconstruction of the country.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'elections']	<p>It is a touching scene, on huge posters all around the city: the eager, respectful son, his hand on his chin, listening to the wisdom of his father, President Heydar Aliyev, the man who has held Azerbaijan in his grip for the past three decades.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the young man, Ilham Aliyev, 42, is expected to receive this former Soviet republic as a gift from his father in a strong-arm election that illustrates the failure of democracy and political freedom to take root throughout most of the old Soviet Union.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>France and Germany decided to join Russia in support of the United Nations resolution on the future of Iraq not because they had been won over by new provisions, officials said Thursday, but out of concern over a spiral of violence in the Middle East coupled with a sense that few new concessions could be wrung from the Bush administration.</p> <p>''We all see a spiral of violence and terror that is growing in Iraq,'' the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, told reporters on Thursday at a summit meeting of European leaders. Noting the deterioration of the situation ''in the Middle East as a whole,'' he said it was ''important to send a message to the Iraqi people that we also want the best conditions for the reconstruction of Iraq.''</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Security Council unanimously approved Thursday an American and British resolution authorizing an American-led multinational force in Iraq. The measure also set a Dec. 15 deadline for the Iraqi Governing Council to lay out a timetable for creating a constitution and democratic government.</p> <p>The international unity on display in the Security Council chamber when all 15 ambassadors raised their hands in assent was something of a diplomatic triumph for the Bush administration after months of apparent isolation here.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Bush administration officials reacted with dismay on Friday to Secretary General Kofi Annan's reluctance to play a supporting role in the Iraqi political transition. His position emboldened critics of the United States' approach and jeopardized the draft of a Security Council resolution on Iraq's future.</p> <p>Mr. Annan spoke once Friday with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and twice with John D. Negroponte, the United States envoy here.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'freedom and human rights', 'war and revolution', 'elections']	<p>Late at night, when the Russian soldiers have retreated for safety from the dark and empty streets, somebody is going around the city tearing down election posters that show the main candidate for president of Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov.</p> <p>''We don't need an ass for president,'' someone has scrawled on one tattered portrait.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'biographical information']	<p>There is a question that irritates President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and it is the one about his past as a foreign intelligence operative of the K.G.B.</p> <p>''They cannot forget about that agency,'' he replied, seemingly to his aides, when asked a version of it in an expansive interview at his wooded presidential estate outside of Moscow. He chuckled, but not warmly.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances', 'banks and banking', 'stocks and bonds']	<p>Prosecutors on Thursday froze stock worth billions of dollars in Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, raising the stakes in their investigation of its imprisoned chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.</p> <p>The move came as the Kremlin announced that President Vladimir V. Putin had removed his chief of staff, Aleksandr S. Voloshin, who had already submitted his resignation to protest Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest. Mr. Putin replaced him with Dmitri A. Medvedev, 38, a lawyer who had been Mr. Voloshin's deputy.</p>
['news and news media', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia's Constitutional Court on Thursday overturned a crucial section of a sweeping law that had severely restricted news coverage of election campaigns, and had even prompted some news organizations to avoid election coverage altogether for fear of being accused of bias and electioneering.</p> <p>''Elections are free only when the right to information and freedom of expression of opinions are truly guaranteed,'' said Valery D. Zorkin, the chairman of the court, who read out the decision.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov of Russia said Thursday that his government expected the American military to withdraw from bases in two former Soviet republics in Central Asia once the mission in Afghanistan was completed.</p> <p>On a day spent reassuring NATO defense ministers that Russia seeks broader cooperation with the Atlantic alliance and has no plans to announce a policy of nuclear pre-emption, Mr. Ivanov also said Russia reserved the right to intervene militarily in former Soviet states if the human rights of ethnic Russians were violated. That forceful restatement of Moscow's concern for ethnic Russians in former Soviet republics comes as NATO prepares to expand beyond former Warsaw Pact nations to include three of those former Soviet states: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'stocks and bonds', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Russia lurched toward a political and economic crisis on Monday as the country's stocks, bonds and currency plummeted after the weekend arrest of Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin, speaking publicly about the arrest for the first time, called for an end to ''hysteria and speculations,'' which reached a new fervor in the two days since masked agents seized Mr. Khodorkovsky, the chairman of Yukos Oil, aboard his corporate jet during a refueling stop in Siberia.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'taxation']	<p>Russia's richest man, the oil baron Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, was seized at gunpoint on Saturday by government security agents and jailed on charges of fraud and tax evasion.</p> <p>The aggressive move against Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, heightens longstanding tensions between the government of President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia's superrich oligarchs, some of whom have fled the country.</p>
['elections']	<p>Election officials confirmed on Monday that the Kremlin's candidate for president of Chechnya, Akhmad Kadyrov, had won overwhelmingly in an election held on Sunday, a result that had never been in doubt in the carefully managed campaign.</p> <p>The officials estimated that Mr. Kadyrov, who has been the acting president, had won well over 80 percent of the vote in a seven-candidate field, although official figures will not be announced until later in the week.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>''We never asked Russia to not build the plant at Bushehr,'' Secretary of State Colin Powell said last month. That's strange. When I was in the Clinton administration, we told the Russians, and more than once, not to build that nuclear power plant in Iran. When they persisted, we pushed them to narrow the scope of their cooperation. In this we succeeded.</p> <p>At the United States' urging, the Russians insisted that the Iranians purchase the nuclear fuel from Russian companies and return the spent fuel to Russia for disposal. Now Russia has almost finished building a reactor at Bushehr, but because of the spent-fuel arrangement the Iranians will not be able to get material for nuclear weapons from it.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'banks and banking', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'suits and litigation', 'taxation']	<p>Yukos, Russia's No.1 oil company, reported a 26 percent surge in quarterly profit on Monday as the company's battle with political authorities at home continued to escalate.</p> <p>Second-quarter profit jumped to $955 million, from $758 million in the period a year earlier. Sales soared 49 percent, to $3.83 billion, which the company attributed to higher production volumes and oil prices. Operating expenses also increased, rising 40 percent, to $494 million, from a year ago.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'frauds and swindling', 'taxation']	<p>The Russian government went on a charm offensive Thursday, with liberal Kremlin aides and international financial aid officials saying the country was not headed toward a reversal on privatized property after the arrest of the country's wealthiest businessman.</p> <p>''The president underlined that there would be no deprivatization,'' Andrei N. Illarionov, a senior Kremlin economic adviser, told the Interfax news agency Thursday. Mr. Illarionov, who is widely viewed as a liberal economic sounding board for President Vladimir V. Putin, said the arrest last month of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the richest of Russia's billionaires, did not reflect selective justice. ''There is no basis to suppose that the use of laws is selective or will be selective,'' Mr. Illarionov said, as reported by Interfax news agency.</p>
['ethics']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday cast the arrest of the country's richest man almost two weeks ago as part of a law and order campaign aimed at Russia's hugely wealthy oligarchs.</p> <p>Speaking heatedly at a news conference in Rome, he said: ''People earned billions, I repeat billions, of dollars in the space of five or six years. This would not have been possible in any Western European nation.''</p>
['terrorism', 'medicine and health', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>American law enforcement officials are investigating the deadly takeover of a Moscow theater last year by Chechen rebels to determine whether Al Qaeda was involved and whether criminal charges should be brought in the United States, officials have said.</p> <p>The death of an American citizen from Oklahoma City who was held hostage in the theater attack in October 2002 has allowed federal prosecutors to consider charges in the United States against Chechen organizers who they suspect may be linked to Al Qaeda, officials said.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>Cranes, eagles and puffins have no trouble crossing a 20-mile-wide finger of the Sea of Okhotsk that separates two national parks, one Russian and one Japanese. But the channel has long been a scary barrier for humans.</p> <p>Now, in an exercise of green diplomacy, environmentalists from both sides are proposing something untested in Asia, a cross-border park.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky resigned as chief executive of Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, on Monday even as he defiantly vowed to continue a public -- and possibly a political -- campaign ''to build an open and truly democratic society in Russia.''</p> <p>Mr. Khodorkovsky, imprisoned since Oct. 25 on charges of embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion, said in a statement that he was stepping aside to shield the company from what he and others have called a politically motivated prosecution.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In the two weeks since Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky was arrested and his oil company's assets were impounded in Russia, President Bush and other top American officials have offered little public criticism of what many in the administration acknowledge has been an extremely worrisome development.</p> <p>Instead, administration officials say that Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and some others have raised American concerns in private, avoiding any public comments that might anger President Vladimir V. Putin or jeopardize cooperation on a range of issues.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>THE battle between President Vladimir V. Putin and a Russian oil tycoon has spread fears that Western companies will shy away from investing in the country's vast energy industry.</p> <p>The good news for the industry is, that probably won't happen. Analysts, economists and investors who follow Russia and its energy sector, the world's largest, say they are not worried that the arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and the state seizure of his multibillion-dollar stake in Yukos Oil herald an eventual renationalization of the oil industry and a withdrawal of civil liberties and property rights.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'frauds and swindling', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin's new chief of staff criticized prosecutors on Sunday for freezing shares in Yukos, the country's largest oil producer, describing the move as potentially reckless and counterproductive.</p> <p>The remarks by the chief of staff, Dmitri A. Medvedev, on state television, appeared to be part of an administration campaign of damage control over the freeze, which was done last week as part of a criminal inquiry. The freeze set off shock waves in Russia's financial markets, pushed Yukos share prices down by a third and raised questions about the country's political and economic direction.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Germany, France and Russia, three of the most vocal opponents of the war in Iraq, reunited in the Security Council on Friday to urge an international conference for the country, much like the conference for Afghanistan in 2001.</p> <p>The three countries also demanded that the United States and Britain ensure that the political transition in Iraq involve all nonviolent elements of Iraqi society, as well as neighboring countries, and that the United Nations be involved throughout.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>The board that administers the Pulitzer Prizes said yesterday that it had decided not to revoke the prize awarded in 1932 to Walter Duranty of The New York Times for a series of articles about the Soviet Union that were later discredited as too credulous of Soviet propaganda.</p> <p>Mr. Duranty's Pulitzer Prize, which was awarded for a series of 13 articles written in 1931, has become the subject of protests by Ukrainians and other groups angry over his failure to report the vast famine of 1932-33 in the Soviet Union.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>There were American flags flying in the crowds that forced Eduard A. Shevardnadze to resign the presidency four days ago, but the language many of the demonstrators were speaking was Russian.</p> <p>This is a former Soviet republic with Western aspirations -- a plum for both Moscow and Washington -- and it is the arena for a familiar and dangerous rivalry that evokes the atmosphere of the cold war.</p>
['television', 'finances']	<p>NTV, one of Russia's biggest national television networks, has been in discussions with Rupert Murdoch and the News Corporation regarding the sale of NTV's satellite business, said two people close to the negotiations.</p> <p>Such a sale would come as part of a broad restructuring by the television channel's parent company, Gazprom, a government-owned natural gas concern. This month, Gazprom will hold its annual board meeting, where it is likely to discuss the fate of its media holdings.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'frauds and swindling', 'ethics']	<p>In the new Russia, cozy ties to power have been the quickest way to riches. This was a maxim well understood by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the oil and banking tycoon -- until he landed in jail.</p> <p>Mr. Khodorkovsky was quick, many say ruthless, to seize on the opening of the Russian economy since the Communist days. That propelled him, at 40, to the status of a billionaire, and he became the wealthiest man in Russia.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'crime and criminals', 'suits and litigation', 'ethics']	<p>Anton V. Drel arrived at the grim Mastrosskaya Tishina prison here last Saturday and signed the papers declaring him the official counsel of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest tycoon. Then a prosecutor presented Mr. Drel with a summons to be questioned as a witness.</p> <p>''Even in the Soviet Union, that never happened,'' he said.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign investments', 'elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'taxation']	<p>As foreign oil companies watch the fight unfold over Russia's biggest oil concern, Yukos, they say it confirms what they have known for a decade, once the country embarked on its zigzag path to a market economy: Russia, for all its changes, is not like the West, and it will not be for some time to come.</p> <p>Investors in Russia's stock market may be tempted to scale back significantly. In the arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the chairman of Yukos, and the freezing of much of the company's stock, analysts may see a giant step back to authoritarianism. But international oil companies have been trying to negotiate the shifting attitudes of the Russian government toward foreign investment for years now.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Protesters in Georgia broke into Parliament on Saturday, forcing President Eduard A. Shevardnadze to flee the hall surrounded by bodyguards, according to reports from the capital, Tbilisi.</p> <p>Mr. Shevardnadze immediately declared a 30-day state of emergency and said he would not resign. He had been in the midst of opening a new session after a parliamentary election three weeks ago that was widely condemned as unfair.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Russia and Iran appeared to draw closer on Monday to an agreement that would clear the way for the completion of a nuclear power plant that Russians are building in Iran.</p> <p>On a visit here, Hassan Rowhani, leader of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said Iran had halted its uranium-enrichment program and was ready to sign a protocol that would be a safeguard against having Iran develop nuclear weapons.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A lawyer for the embattled Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky said Tuesday that a court in Moscow would decide Nov. 11 whether to release him on bail. Pressure on his company and others continued, with some top executives leaving the country and President Vladimir V. Putin publicly criticizing one businessman.</p> <p>In an interview with Italian journalists on the eve of a visit to Italy, Mr. Putin expressed blunt displeasure about what he called tax evasion that had been practiced by an unidentified executive connected with Mr. Khodorkovsky's company, Yukos Oil.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>Russia today is ruled by Vladimir Putin's siloviki, former K.G.B. men and military officers who have the nation by the throat. That power-hungry mafia (the Russian word is rooted in ''power'') brooks no opposition from either the small band of democratic reformers or the political leftovers from the Yeltsin regime.</p> <p>Only one power center posed a threat to the siloviki's domination of Russian life. This was the group of oligarchs, who became the super-rich by ripping off the old Soviet Union's natural resources when Communism collapsed.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In early 2001, as George W. Bush's administration moved into the White House, one of Russia's wealthiest men, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, sought a meeting with the new national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. According to a former staff member, National Security Council analysts were asked to perform a background check.</p> <p>Mr. Khodorkovsky did not get the meeting -- part of the tycoon's efforts to secure approval from the American establishment -- because of ''allegations of past business improprieties,'' the former staff member said, also noting that Mr. Khodorkovsky spent heavily in Washington to court the Capitol's inner circle.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'ethics', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations', 'law and legislation', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia, once acclaimed for his role in helping to end the cold war, resigned Sunday in the face of huge public protests over the corruption and economic collapse that have marked his nearly 12-year rule.</p> <p>''I'm going home now,'' Mr. Shevardnadze told reporters on live television after a final meeting with opposition leaders, and the streets of the capital erupted in celebration.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'ethics']	<p>Elena Collongues-Popova worked for years in silence, as the financial architect of parts of the early empire built by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who controls Yukos, the giant Russian oil company.</p> <p>But she has since turned on Mr. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, after French tax police fined her roughly $15 million over actions she said she undertook on behalf of his early business dealings.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'terrorism']	<p>With Saddam Hussein finally in custody and the future of Iraq looking a little more secure, we're hearing calls for President Bush to rip up the list of countries that the United States has deemed eligible to bid on prime contracts for rebuilding Iraq. Mr. Bush should stick to his guns; that list of 63 countries, all of whom helped the American-led coalition, was good policy. But it's important to be clear about why it is a good idea -- because in the piñata grab for the $18.6 billion in reconstruction contracts, some basic points have gotten lost.</p> <p>First, it is wrong of critics to frame inclusion on the list as a ''reward'' to our allies, or to say that countries left off it, like Russia, France and Germany, are being ''punished.'' Taxpayer-financed contracts should never be doled out as a reward -- that is precisely the kind of mind-set the United States needs to be trying to banish from Iraq, where the previous regime operated entirely ran on patronage.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>In a safe house in a village here, a North Korean mother sits on the floor, hunched over and crying silently, wiping away tears -- not because she is hungry or cold, but because she is warm and well fed.</p> <p>''Here we have enough food and clothes, in a way that is unimaginable in North Korea,'' she says. ''Whenever I eat and dress in new clothes, I feel guilty because of my family members still in North Korea.''</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>A Russian court on Tuesday extended the detention period for Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, to March 25, well after the scheduled date of Russia's presidential elections. Lawyers for Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former chief of the oil company Yukos, said they would appeal the court's decision.</p> <p>Mr. Khodorkovsky's custody had been scheduled to end on Dec. 30. No date has been set for his trial on charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion.</p>
['foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>Japan said Monday that it was prepared to forgive most of the billions of dollars of debts that Iraq owes Japan in order to help rebuild the economy, if other creditors did the same.</p> <p>The announcement, which came after Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi met with a United States envoy, James A. Baker III, brightened Washington's efforts to reduce Iraq's $120 billion debt to other nations.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The newly elected Russian Parliament convened Monday and after a quick bit of horse-trading, the bloc supporting President Vladimir V. Putin established a two-thirds majority, which will allow it to pass any laws or make any constitutional changes it wishes.</p> <p>''Instead of political confrontation, we have before us a constructive Parliament,'' Mr. Putin said, addressing the chamber for the first time since his own election as president four years ago.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'television', 'legislatures and parliaments']	<p>Russians voted convincingly for a party loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin in parliamentary elections on Sunday, expanding his already dominant political control in the first electoral test of his leadership since he became president nearly four years ago.</p> <p>With 80 percent of the ballots counted by early Monday, United Russia, an alliance of politicians, ministers and businessmen united less by ideology than by their support of Mr. Putin, had collected 36.7 percent of the vote, more than double that of any other party.</p>
['elections']	<p>In America the relationship between big business and politics may often be cozy; in Russia it is fast becoming intimate.</p> <p>The nation's largest businesses, from oil giants to banks to manufacturers, have not only poured money into the parliamentary elections to be held on Sunday, but have also filled party tickets with dozens of their own executives.</p>
['foreign investments', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Russia has offered to forgive more than half of Iraq's $8 billion debt to Russia, officials of Iraq's interim government said here on Monday, after the Iraqis signaled that Russia would have the chance to revive oil contracts signed during the Saddam Hussein era.</p> <p>Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the current president of the American-backed Iraqi Governing Council, said President Vladimir V. Putin proposed in talks with the Iraqis to wipe out 65 percent of Iraq's Soviet-era debts to Russia in return for favorable treatment of Russian oil and other companies.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>Russia, France, Germany, Canada and other countries barred by the Pentagon from bidding for $18.6 billion worth of prime reconstruction contracts in Iraq reacted angrily Wednesday, saying that the move was all the more astonishing given recent appeals by Washington for help in postwar Iraq.</p> <p>Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, immediately ruled out any write-off of Iraq's $120 billion debt, a project that just last week President Bush appointed former Secretary of State James A. Baker III to oversee. ''Iraq's debt to the Russia Federation comes to $8 billion, and as far as the Russian government's position on this, it is not planning'' any forgiveness of those arrears, he told the Interfax news agency. ''Iraq is not a poor country.''</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'foreign aid', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>President Bush found himself in the awkward position on Wednesday of calling the leaders of France, Germany and Russia to ask them to forgive Iraq's debts, just a day after the Pentagon excluded those countries and others from $18 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects.</p> <p>White House officials were fuming about the timing and the tone of the Pentagon's directive, even while conceding that they had approved the Pentagon policy of limiting contracts to 63 countries that have given the United States political or military aid in Iraq.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>While the Bush administration wants to freeze economic ties with North Korea until the country puts its nuclear program under international controls, Russia's Far East is aggressively repairing and expanding its relationship with North Korea.</p> <p>Invited by the North Korean government, teams of Russian engineers have in recent weeks inspected the cargo port of Najin, the oil refinery at the port and a stretch of railway that crosses the two countries' short common border at the Tumen River. All three facilities, built by the Soviet Union, have been in mothballs or lightly used in recent years.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism', 'elections']	<p>A suicide bomber set off a devastating explosion inside a crowded commuter train in southern Russia on Friday, killing at least 42 passengers, officials said. President Vladimir V. Putin denounced the bombing as a terrorist act intended to disrupt parliamentary elections here this weekend.</p> <p>The explosion, which occurred at 7:42 a.m., wrenched apart the second carriage of the train only moments after it left the station in Yessentuki, near the foothills of the Caucasus, not far from Chechnya.</p>
['terrorism', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>James A. Baker III briefed President Bush on Friday on his five-nation trip to reduce Iraq's foreign debt, and administration officials said Mr. Baker was planning to travel to other countries in the coming weeks.</p> <p>But administration officials would not identify the countries, or confirm that one of them might be Japan. They also provided no account of the conversation between Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker, who has kept an unusually low profile as the president's personal envoy sent to negotiate the reduction of more than $100 billion in Iraqi foreign debt.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>The morning starts with 100 push-ups for Constant Olivier Diboi Kath as he prepares for the most dangerous moment of his day -- his subway ride to chemistry class on the other side of town.</p> <p>Mr. Diboi Kath, 23, is an exchange student from Cameroon, and like many other African college students in Russia he says he feels threatened by racist thugs every time he leaves his dormitory.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'finances', 'credit']	<p>President Bush on Thursday defended his policy of barring France, Germany, Russia and other nations from $18.6 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects. But despite the anger the policy has aroused in foreign capitals, he said his personal envoy, James A. Baker III, would still meet with the leaders of several of those nations to ask that they forgive debts they are owed by Iraq.</p> <p>The president's argument was that only those nations that contributed militarily to the American effort in Iraq should reap the benefits of the $18.6 billion that Congress approved last month for reconstruction.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>James Baker sets off to negotiate Iraqi debt forgiveness with our estranged allies. And at that very moment the deputy secretary of defense releases a ''Determination and Findings'' on reconstruction contracts that not only excludes those allies from bidding, but does so with highly offensive language. What's going on?</p> <p>Maybe I'm giving Paul Wolfowitz too much credit, but I don't think this was mere incompetence. I think the administration's hard-liners are deliberately sabotaging reconciliation.</p>
['children and youth', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Outside, arctic darkness envelops the mountains, but inside, a video of a bikini-clad Beyoncé blasts on a big screen in this northern Russian mining town, and members of the New Civilization youth movement are discussing their latest project.</p> <p>They are working up an MTV-style public service announcement on the benefits of the Internet. Previously they made an antismoking commercial.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'ethics']	<p>Only months before it cements its place in Europe by joining NATO and the European Union, Lithuania has plunged into a political scandal involving allegations of corruption, organized crime and shadowy dealings with its neighbor, Russia.</p> <p>Lithuania's Parliament has begun the formal process of impeaching the president, Rolandas Paksas, a self-described populist who has held office only since February. This week Parliament formed a 12-member commission to investigate accusations that he abused his oath, including by aiding a campaign contributor of Russian and Lithuanian background, and leaking secret details of a criminal investigation. In an interview, he denied the accusations.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'elections']	<p>A suicide bomber blew herself up outside a historic hotel in the center of Moscow on Tuesday, officials said, killing at least 5 others and seriously wounding 13 several hundred feet from the Kremlin, Red Square and Parliament.</p> <p>The bomb exploded just before 11 on a cold, snowy morning, leaving a scene of chaos and carnage.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin spoke out pre-emptively on Tuesday against those who, he said, hoped to turn the results of the parliamentary elections on Sunday into a mandate to amend Russia's still young Constitution.</p> <p>''The Constitution has become the basis of stability in society,'' Mr. Putin said in televised remarks to regional lawmakers at the Kremlin. ''And our task is to stop all talk about the necessity of changing the Constitution and to concentrate our attention on something different: how to preserve the Constitution within the framework in which we live.''</p>
['elections', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'legislatures and parliaments', 'ethics']	<p>By taking over the mass media and seizing the political opposition's source of funds, Vladimir Putin and his K.G.B. cohort have brought back one-party rule to Russia.</p> <p>This week's corrupted Russian election put in place the siloviki -- the hot political word means ''power'' -- and paved the way for Putin's takeover next spring as president-for-life. Russia's short-lived experiment with democracy is all but dead.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Pentagon has barred French, German and Russian companies from competing for $18.6 billion in contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq, saying it was acting to protect ''the essential security interests of the United States.''</p> <p>The directive, issued Friday by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, represents the most substantive retaliation to date by the Bush administration against American allies who opposed its decision to go to war in Iraq.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'public opinion']	<p>''By their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans,'' President Vladimir V. Putin said in an interview this fall, addressing the centuries-old choice here between East and West.</p> <p>The real question, however, is whether Russia is -- or even wants to be -- part of today's Europe.</p>
['treaties']	<p>A senior Kremlin official declared Tuesday that Russia would not ratify the international treaty requiring cuts in the emissions of gases linked to global warming, delivering what could be a fatal blow to years of diplomatic efforts.</p> <p>The official, Andrei N. Illarionov, said in remarks to reporters and in a subsequent interview that President Vladimir V. Putin had told a group of European businessmen on Tuesday that the treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, ran counter to Russia's national interests.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'bombs and explosives', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell embarked on a five-nation, four-day tour on Tuesday, hoping to mend fences with Europeans upset by the American strategy in Iraq and to stiffen the resolve of North African nations rattled by terror attacks to continue to fight Islamic militants.</p> <p>As he jetted from the Netherlands to Tunisia to Morocco, Mr. Powell carried a message that American success in Iraq and in the broader fight against terrorism would require allies, partnerships and the cooperation of international organizations, including the United Nations and NATO.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'freedom and human rights', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>International observers on Monday criticized Russia's parliamentary elections as a step backward in the country's democratic transition, only moments after President Vladimir V. Putin described them as ''free, honest, open and democratic.''</p> <p>United Russia, the party defined almost entirely by its fealty to Mr. Putin, swept to overwhelming victory on Sunday after benefiting, the observers said, from fawning coverage on state television and official support at all levels of government. Mr. Putin's party crushed the Communists and ousted all but a handful of liberal democrats from Parliament, capturing the most votes of any party in any election since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia's future will be defined as much by geology as by ideology. Unfortunately, while leaders can pick their ideology, they don't have much of a choice when it comes to geology.</p> <p>Russia has a lot of oil, and this inescapable geological fact will determine many of the policy choices available to it. Oil and gas now account for roughly 20 percent of Russia's economy, 55 percent of all its export earnings and 40 percent of its total tax revenues. Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and its subsoil contains about 30 percent of the world's gas reserves. It already supplies 30 percent of Europe's gas needs. And Russia's oil and gas industry will only become more important. No other sector has the potential to be as internationally competitive, or as profitable.</p>
['treaties', 'law and legislation']	<p>Since it was negotiated in Japan in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol, the first treaty that would require countries to curb emissions linked to global warming, has lingered in an indeterminate state, between enactment and outright rejection.</p> <p>On Tuesday its prospects were dealt what may have been a fatal blow when a top Russian official said his country would not ratify it. But some experts on climate and diplomacy say that the fate of the Kyoto treaty itself is rapidly becoming less important than the longer-term processes it set in motion.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>In a bulging metropolis peopled by the elite and the destitute, a billionaire businessman is waging a come-from-behind campaign for mayor. Running against a wildly popular incumbent, the challenger is calling for an end to corruption and saying he will run the city as a transparent business and end the chokehold of bureaucracy.</p> <p>On Sunday, Muscovites will elect a mayor, and Aleksandr Lebedev, 43, is startlingly optimistic -- for a man lagging in the polls. As a long-shot candidate with no political experience but deep pockets, he likes to compare himself to New York City's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, although he notes that ''Bloomberg had much more time than me to catch up.''</p>
['television']	<p>Surprisingly, President Vladimir V. Putin stumbled a bit over several questions during a well-prepared three-hour television call-in program on Thursday.</p> <p>Is he a strict parent? What kind of music does he like? How are his newborn puppies doing? Has he had a tough year?</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>The Kremlin announced Thursday night that Russia would join negotiations to reduce Iraq's crushing foreign debt but emphasized that the talks would have to address the interests of Russian companies that signed contracts with the former Iraqi government.</p> <p>The Russian agreement capped three days of meetings among European leaders and James A. Baker III, the special envoy appointed by President Bush to persuade skeptical nations to support the administration's call to cut Iraq's debt.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>A political party that did not exist in Russia's last election, that offered only the vaguest prescriptions for the country's ills and that did not bother to take part in debates against its rivals appears headed to a resounding victory in the parliamentary race on Sunday on the basis of nothing more -- and nothing less -- than the power and popularity of President Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>The party, United Russia, through a coalition with smaller parties and independent lawmakers loyal to Mr. Putin, already controls a slight majority of the 450 seats in Russia's lower house of Parliament, or Duma.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Here in Slavyanka, or Slavic village, a European outpost 50 miles north of the North Korean border, the Slavic population implosion is as clear as roadside meadows where cows graze among the concrete shells of abandoned houses.</p> <p>But the demographic transformation of Russia's Far East, local politicians say, could have a silver lining of global importance: providing new homes for refugees from North Korea.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution', 'ethics']	<p>Pledging to end corruption and seek an end to his nation's long-running wars of secession, Mikhail Saakashvili took office as president of Georgia on Sunday in ceremonies that accorded special honors to the United States and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of Georgians applauded Mr. Saakashvili, a 36-year-old former city council president who studied and practiced law in the United States in the 1990's, at the faded yellow stone Parliament building where two months ago he led a successful uprising to oust President Eduard A. Shevardnadze.</p>
['elections']	<p>Such is the state of politics in Russia today that perhaps the most prominent challenger of Vladimir V. Putin in this year's presidential election accepted his party's nomination with an impassioned endorsement of the incumbent.</p> <p>''When a leader who is trusted goes into battle, he must not be left alone,'' Sergei M. Mironov, chairman of the upper house of Parliament and leader of the Russian Party of Life, said of Mr. Putin after the party's nominating congress on Sunday. ''One must stand beside him.''</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sought to assure Russians on Tuesday that despite American plans to redeploy some troops to former Soviet bloc nations in Eastern Europe, the United States had no intention of encircling or threatening their country.</p> <p>Interviewed on a Moscow radio station, Mr. Powell said that while the level of American forces in Europe was falling to fewer than 100,000 from more than 300,000, the Bush administration has been looking at the possibility of putting ''temporary facilities'' in Eastern Europe for training or use as air bases. Forces based in these areas might be sent in emergencies to the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Central Asia, he said.</p>
['frauds and swindling']	<p>Russia's prosecution of Yukos Oil is becoming an international manhunt.</p> <p>Yuri S. Biryukov, the first deputy prosecutor general, said Tuesday that a court had placed 10 of the company's shareholders or employees on international wanted lists, including some senior executives who have sought asylum in Israel.</p>
['finances', 'credit']	<p>Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III has secured pledges from four Persian Gulf nations to reduce their holdings of Iraq's debt, a senior State Department official said Wednesday.</p> <p>The official said negotiations with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar had been far more difficult than earlier discussions with Russia, France, Germany, Japan and other large creditor nations in Europe and Asia.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'immigration and refugees']	<p>A week before Christmas, a green BMW rolled up to the Canadian border near Buffalo. As the driver, Alexandre Konanykhine, a Russian seeking political asylum in Canada, paid a bridge toll to leave the United States about a dozen armed federal agents surrounded his car and arrested him, Mr. Konanykhine said.</p> <p>American authorities then whisked him to a local airport and on to the Russian Embassy in Washington, Mr. Konanykhine said, where they unsuccessfully attempted to enforce a federal order that he be deported to Russia. Mr. Konanykhine, an ex-banker, now sits in an Arlington, Va., jail awaiting a federal court hearing next week.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'finances', 'credit', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia is hoping to leverage its plans for debt relief for Iraq to win the revival of oil development projects signed under Saddam Hussein and suspended by the occupation authorities, Bush administration officials say.</p> <p>The administration, which is formally taking a hands-off approach that would leave decisions on contracts to a future Iraqi government, is giving tentative approval to Moscow's approach, which could mean billions for Russian companies.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, arriving in Georgia for the inauguration of its new president, asserted that Russia had no reason to be concerned about the United States desire for friendship with this troubled region, which Russians consider within their sphere of influence.</p> <p>Only two months after a popular revolt forced the resignation of Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Georgia's president, Mr. Powell was here to support the efforts of the newly elected president, Mikhail Saakashvili, to gain control of a country widely described as fractured, impoverished and hobbled by corruption.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'news and news media', 'elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell criticized curbs on free elections and the news media, as well as the Russian military campaign in Chechnya, in meetings with the Russian president on Monday and in an essay in a Russian newspaper. His words were the toughest public stance to date by a Bush administration official.</p> <p>''Certain developments in Russian politics and foreign policy in recent months have given us pause,'' Mr. Powell said in his essay, published Monday in the newspaper Izvestia. Mr. Powell said he raised those concerns in seven hours of meetings with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and other officials at the Kremlin.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>The Bush administration, trying to rescue its troubled plan to restore sovereignty to Iraq, is joining Iraqi leaders to press the United Nations to play a role in choosing an interim government in Baghdad, administration officials said Thursday.</p> <p>L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Baghdad, and an Iraqi delegation led by Adnan Pachachi, the current chairman of the Iraqi Governing Council, will make an urgent appeal on Monday for greater United Nations involvement, the officials said.</p>
['elections', 'finances']	<p>A Moscow court rejected an appeal on Thursday by the jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky that he be freed on bail pending trial. No court date has been set.</p> <p>The Moscow City Court's ruling upheld a decision by a lower court and said that Mr. Khodorkovsky must remain jailed until at least March 25, with many more extensions possible. Thus Russia's richest man will remain behind bars through the March 14 presidential elections, which the highly popular incumbent Vladimir V. Putin is expected to sweep.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>What passes for Russia's presidential contest is progressing smartly.</p> <p>One candidate has been refused a spot on the ballot, while two others, both businessmen, abruptly withdrew this week with as little fanfare -- and clear explanation -- as when they entered the race.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'finances']	<p>Despite needle-prick winds, numbing cold and winter days that crawl into constant darkness, miners seldom stop hollowing out the hills surrounding this Arctic town.</p> <p>Few of the workers, it seems, want to stay. But even fewer have better options. In a country where a quarter of the population lives in poverty and the average wage is $190 a month, a steady job is a good job.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'ethics']	<p>The collision between Russia's most powerful politician, President Vladimir V. Putin, and its richest businessman, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, had been brewing for months when Mr. Khodorkovsky took the step that more than any other landed him in prison -- trying to sell a major stake in his oil company, Yukos, to ExxonMobil.</p> <p>As recounted by associates and analysts, Mr. Khodorkovsky failed to consult the Kremlin adequately about a deal that would cede substantial control over a strategic Russian resource to a foreign company, and an American one at that.</p>
['espionage', 'computers and the internet']	<p>Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of ''the Farewell dossier'': how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia -- all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss -- helped us win the cold war.</p> <p>Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president -- détente notwithstanding -- to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the U.S.S.R.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States and North Korea said Saturday that they were committed to deepening negotiations over the North's nuclear weapons program, ending four days of inconclusive discussions with an unusual show of conciliation.</p> <p>Senior Bush administration officials and Kim Kye Kwan, North Korea's top negotiator at the six-nation talks here, said that while their main differences remained unresolved, the talks had proved useful. They pledged to meet in smaller working groups soon and hold another formal session before the end of June.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'ethics', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In its final years in power, Saddam Hussein's government systematically extracted billions of dollars in kickbacks from companies doing business with Iraq, funneling most of the illicit funds through a network of foreign bank accounts in violation of United Nations sanctions.</p> <p>Millions of Iraqis were struggling to survive on rations of food and medicine. Yet the government's hidden slush funds were being fed by suppliers and oil traders from around the world who sometimes lugged suitcases full of cash to ministry offices, said Iraqi officials who supervised the skimming operation.</p>
['elections']	<p>Just as bizarrely as he disappeared on Thursday, a Russian presidential candidate reappeared Tuesday alive and well, if obviously wan and confused about the fuss he had caused.</p> <p>''I decided last week to take a break from all the bustle around me,'' the politician, Ivan P. Rybkin, told the Interfax news agency from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, by way of explaining his disappearance, which terrified his family and his campaign aides and prompted a police manhunt.</p>
['bombs and explosives']	<p>Qatar has arrested two Russian secret agents and charged them in the killing of an exiled Chechen leader there, prompting a sharply worded rebuke from Russia on Thursday that accused Qatari authorities of violating international law.</p> <p>In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry denied any Russian involvement in the death of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, the former president of the Chechen republic, who was killed Feb. 13 when a bomb destroyed his car in Doha, the capital of Qatar.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>The United States, North Korea and four other nations on Thursday discussed freezing North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for energy aid. But the continuing talks here also exposed stark disagreements that left diplomats wondering whether they could emerge with much more than a commitment to keep negotiating.</p> <p>Both the United States and North Korea appeared to make modest concessions at the talks, several participants said, and the tone was described as constructive and lacking the invective that often punctuates discussions with North Korea. The two had private meetings during each of the first two days as well as participating in group discussions.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Russian Parliament on Thursday unexpectedly scheduled a vote this month on a long-ignored bill that would extend the presidential term to seven years, even though President Vladimir V. Putin has publicly opposed such constitutional changes.</p> <p>The legislation was introduced by a group of regional lawmakers in 2002 but languished. As written, it could allow Mr. Putin to run for two new terms, conceivably keeping him in power until 2018.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Inspectors have found evidence that some of the highly enriched uranium found on nuclear machinery in Iran came from Russia, European diplomats and American experts said Friday. The nuclear fuel appears to have come through the global black market, the experts added, and not with the blessings of Moscow.</p> <p>With the findings, Russia emerges as a new and unexpected foreign source of supply to Iran's nuclear efforts. Recent revelations had shown that the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan had provided Iran with some sophisticated centrifuge technology that could be used to refine weapons-grade uranium through his hidden nuclear trading network, according to international nuclear officials and Dr. Khan's own testimony.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States, North Korea and four other nations were due to issue a statement Saturday pledging to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, but they left almost all major disputes about the North's nuclear program unresolved, officials and news reports said.</p> <p>In a joint statement that China, the host of the six-nation talks, was scrambling to finalize Saturday afternoon, the participants also agreed to meet again by June and to establish working groups that would tackle some of the most contentious issues about nuclear disarmament before then, according to Bush administration officials.</p>
['elections']	<p>The mystery over the disappearance of a presidential candidate deepened Monday.</p> <p>Moscow's prosecutor's office announced that it had opened a murder investigation in the case of the candidate, Ivan P. Rybkin, only to have federal prosecutors overrule them and close the case within an hour, saying there was no evidence yet to suggest foul play.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>On Japan's northern edge, the long-running threat from Russia was as real as the debris on the beaches in 1983 from the Korean passenger plane shot down by a Soviet fighter jet from Sakhalin, a dagger-shaped island 26 miles north of here.</p> <p>In this windblown settlement, people have watched Sakhalin tossed back and forth by tides of war. Japan won the southern half of Sakhalin in the Russo-Japanese War, a grinding conflict that broke out 100 years ago, on Feb. 8, 1904. In the closing days of World War II, it was Russia's turn as Stalin's troops drove the Japanese across the narrow strait, turning this port into a fearful, refugee-clogged city.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'news and news media', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>A small bomb exploded on Monday outside the apartment of a journalist who has created a political sensation with a behind-the-scenes account of the Kremlin during President Vladimir V. Putin's rise to power.</p> <p>The journalist, Yelena Tregubova, was not injured, but she said in an interview that she feared that the bombing was an attempt on her life. The bomb exploded moments before she left her apartment for a taxi that was waiting downstairs, she said.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'gas (fuel)', 'energy and power']	<p>On North Korea's desolate eastern coast, 600 miles directly across the Sea of Japan from here, soldiers guard an abandoned construction site where two light-water nuclear reactors were to be built.</p> <p>North Korea is desperately short of energy, and agreed in 1994 to halt its nuclear weapons program in exchange for help from its capitalist neighbors and the United States in building nuclear power plants. But work at the site was halted on Dec. 1 because the United States said North Korea had violated the 1994 agreement by pursuing nuclear weapons anyway. On Friday, the State Department said the civilian nuclear power program had ''no future.'' In retaliation, North Korea is holding hostage the construction equipment at the site belonging to contractors from South Korea, which has sunk almost $1 billion into the project.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>This city is no longer the venue of appeasement.</p> <p>At an annual security conference here on the eve of NATO's seven-state expansion, Moscow's neo-imperialist defense minister threatened to back out of an agreement limiting the size of his armed forces on Russia's European front.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections']	<p>One of Vladimir V. Putin's challengers in the presidential election next month is missing, and the police and security services announced Sunday that they had begun a search for him.</p> <p>Ivan P. Rybkin, a former Parliament speaker and national security adviser under Boris N. Yeltsin, has not been seen or heard from since Thursday evening, raising fears among his family and campaign aides that something dire has happened to him.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States and North Korea have agreed to resume six-party talks later this month over the North's nuclear weapons program, the State Department said Tuesday.</p> <p>The negotiations, scheduled to start in Beijing on Feb. 25, are likely to focus on North Korea's offer to suspend its nuclear programs in return for a security guarantee and other concessions.</p>
['television', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>It was a few minutes before 5 on a recent night and the deadline was approaching for the nightly news of the Russian state. The anchor of Vesti, Mikhail Antonov, still without makeup, his hair tousled, had to decide whether to trim the report on protests in Latvia or a train wreck in Chicago.</p> <p>It was out of the question to trim what almost always tops the news, whether interesting or not. ''If there is no obvious breaking news, we start with the president,'' said Mr. Antonov, whose program appears on the state channel Rossiya, or Russia.</p>
['books and literature', 'biographical information']	<p>While most Americans were celebrating Presidents' Day yesterday, a very different holiday was being honored in Princeton, N.J. George F. Kennan, who formulated the policy of ''containment'' of the Soviet Union during the early cold war, turned 100. Surrounded by his wife and four children the frail Mr. Kennan -- diplomat, historian and sometimes Cassandra -- had reached a birthday he never imagined.</p> <p>''The last thing he ever expected was to live so long,'' said his biographer, John Lewis Gaddis, a professor of history and political science at Yale. ''As a young man he was often sick. During his freshman year at Princeton he had scarlet fever and was forced to drop out. He never felt himself to be healthy. Ulcers were a constant problem.''</p>
['elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin abruptly dismissed Russia's prime minister and his cabinet on Tuesday, announcing that he would appoint a new government in a surprise shuffling of ministers on the eve of an election Mr. Putin is sure to win.</p> <p>Mr. Putin, who announced his decision in a brief, emotionless address on state television, did not directly criticize the work of the prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, but said the country's voters deserved to know the shape of the new government before casting their ballots on March 14. But Mr. Putin did not explain exactly what shape the new government would take. Nor did he make any immediate announcement of a replacement, though he did install one of Mr. Kasyanov's deputies, Viktor B. Khristenko, as acting prime minister.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Can people who have been taught only submission for generations, who are strangers to democracy, be trusted to govern themselves?</p> <p>That's the question facing us in Iraq today.

['missiles and missile defense systems', 'elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin oversaw one of Russia's largest strategic military exercises in years for a second day on Wednesday, and, for a second day, something went wrong.</p> <p>An intercontinental ballistic missile fired from the nuclear submarine Karelia in the Barents Sea veered wildly off course 98 seconds after the launching and self-destructed, a navy spokesman, Capt. Igor V. Dygalo, said. The cause of the malfunction, he said, would be investigated.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Everybody was shoving, but Vasily Mandazhe held his ground. ''They won't let us in,'' he shouted. ''When are they going to let us in?''</p> <p>The names of Mr. Mandazhe's sons, Sergei and Ivan, were on a list of the wounded taped to the hospital door. But that was all the information anybody was going to get about the victims of a bombing in the Moscow subway on Friday morning, in which officials said at least 39 people died and 130 were wounded.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>A bomb exploded inside a crowded subway train during the morning rush on Friday, killing at least 39 people and wounding more than 130. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing though senior government officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, said they suspected that it was the latest in a series of terrorist attacks linked to the war in Chechnya.</p> <p>The bomb, said to have been hidden in a backpack or bag, ravaged the second car of the train as it left the Avtozavodskaya station in southeast Moscow and headed toward the city's center at 8:45 a.m. The blast shattered the train's windows, rent its metal seats and bars and hurled bodies and body parts from the train.</p>
['books and literature']	<p>It was a heady moment. Liberation was at hand. The world's most powerful totalitarian state had been defeated. World-historical struggles had come to an end.</p> <p>Such was the situation after the Soviet Union collapsed. And the sense of triumph was palpable. In an essay reprinted in ''The Norman Podhoretz Reader'' (Free Press), Mr. Podhoretz wrote a ''Eulogy'' for neo-conservatism -- the political and cultural movement with which he and the magazine he edited, Commentary, had been so closely identified. It was a eulogy that proclaimed satisfaction and closure. For two decades, Commentary had advocated unrelenting challenges to Soviet power, and while the downfall had never been seen as imminent, it had always been hoped for.</p>
['books and literature', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>To unravel our intelligence failures in Iraq, it helps to look back at what was once one of the most secret and scary chapters in U.S.-Soviet relations. An intelligence failure risked nuclear war in the 1980's -- but this was a mistake by the K.G.B.</p> <p>In 1981, we now know, the K.G.B. chairman said at a secret conference that President Ronald Reagan was planning to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. The Soviets became consumed with the U.S. threat, just as the Bush administration became obsessed with the Iraq threat. The K.G.B. ordered all its offices in NATO countries to seek evidence of Mr. Reagan's plans for a pre-emptive nuclear strike, and they code-named the effort RYAN.</p>

There was a challenge in her eyes and a bit of fun too. There is no shilly-shallying around Irina M. Khakamada. This is a 48-year-old woman who tried three husbands before she found the one she liked.</p>
['elections']	<p>Ivan P. Rybkin, the Russian presidential candidate who disappeared for five days before resurfacing in Ukraine this week, appeared in London on Friday and offered yet another explanation for his bizarre absence, saying he had been drugged and kidnapped.</p> <p>None of Mr. Rybkin's remarks could be corroborated, and his new version contradicted statements he made after returning to Moscow on Tuesday night and in a rambling radio interview the next day.</p>
['elections']	<p>Vladimir Putin, who will be handily re-elected president of Russia today, is never going to become a Western-style, liberal-democratic politician, no matter how much we wish it. He is a quintessentially Russian leader, with very traditional aspirations and interests, and until the West gets used to it, he will continue to be a tantalizing source of frustration and disappointment.</p> <p>When Mr. Putin diverges from the democratic path -- as when he abruptly dismissed his prime minister and entire cabinet last month -- Western observers tend to either criticize his authoritarianism or simply declare him ''an enigma'' (the traditional cop-out for pundits when they do not understand Russian leaders). And we pose the familiar questions: is Mr. Putin a reformer or a hard-liner? Is he his own man or is he controlled by the dreaded siloviki, the former security officials who have become the powers in the Kremlin? Was it the president or the siloviki who arrested the oil mogul Mikhail Khodorkovsky, seized control of the news media from private owners, purged and re-purged the benighted dystopia of Chechnya?</p>
['elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Central Intelligence Agency is warning of a ''greater assertiveness'' on the part of Russia if President Vladimir V. Putin wins re-election as expected on Sunday.</p> <p>A new C.I.A. assessment made public this week says that assertiveness by Russia is likely to be evident both at home and abroad, with its tough stance in the war on Chechnya unlikely to soften and with a more robust approach toward neighboring countries like Georgia and Ukraine backed up by the increasing stakes taken by Russian companies in those countries' energy industries.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'news and news media', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Even by Russian standards of democracy, it was a little much to refuse to let patients check into the hospital unless they could prove they had their absentee ballots for Sunday's presidential election.</p> <p>That is what the health committee in Khabarovsk in Russia's Far East ordered beginning March 1 to try to increase voter turnout, about the only drama in an election that President Vladimir V. Putin is all but certain to win.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Almost two weeks after North Korea agreed to new, supposedly more intimate ''working groups'' to discuss its nuclear weapons program, Bush administration officials say that the agenda for the talks remains unclear and that the discussions may not occur until April or May.</p> <p>The idea of trying to resolve disagreements over North Korea's nuclear programs in one or more working groups came up in the last round of talks in Beijing at the end of February. Besides the United States and North Korea, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan took part.</p>
['elections']	<p>This city and the rest of Russia will vote in presidential elections tomorrow, but most Westerners would be baffled by the campaign that has led up to the voting. In his re-election bid, President Vladimir Putin refused to participate in any debates, make any policy statements, respond to his few timid detractors or explain his plans for Russia's future.</p> <p>And Russians think that's just fine. ''An election campaign? What for?'' said Stepan Kirichiuk, 54, who is the mayor of Tyumen, the capital of Western Siberia.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Although most independent observers agree that last week's presidential election in Russia was unfair, there is little doubt that Vladimir V. Putin would have won re-election by a landslide even in an honest election. That's because a campaign slogan used to great effect in America 12 years ago -- ''It's the economy, stupid'' -- also holds true in Russia.</p> <p>An economic record similar to Mr. Putin's would assure the incumbent's re-election in almost any democratic country. By almost any measure, the record is outstanding.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'elections']	<p>There is almost no sign of a presidential election campaign here in the Russian heartland, but apparently there is very little desire for one.</p> <p>From shoemaker to shopkeeper to hunter to teacher, it seems that almost everyone is backing the same candidate, the incumbent president, Vladimir V.

['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'atomic energy']	<p>North Korean radio on Saturday explicitly rejected the formula the United States has put forward as its bottom-line position in talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programs, raising doubts about whether the fitful negotiations are making even limited progress.</p> <p>The statement carried by Radio Pyongyang and monitored by news agencies in South Korea came just after a visit to North Korea by China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, and shortly before a visit to the region by Vice President Dick Cheney that is planned for April. It used typically unrestrained language in accusing the United States of secretly planning a war.</p>

In most races it attracts a few percent of contrary votes. Here in this faded industrial city on the Volga, it won. Twice.</p> <p>In the December parliamentary election, voters of District 181 threw out not only the incumbent, a retired general, but the rest of the pack as well. ''Against all,'' the box at the bottom of the ballot, received nearly 20 percent of the votes, more than double what any of the 14 actual candidates won.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Saudi Arabian officials said on Sunday that they were seeking to strengthen ties with China and Russia after allowing energy companies from those countries to be among the first foreign businesses to explore Saudi natural gas reserves in more than three decades.</p> <p>The Saudi contracts are with Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil companies, and Sinopec, a large Chinese oil and gas producer. They were signed here on Sunday after protracted talks with several large American energy companies had collapsed over differences on terms and amid perceptions of a more distant relationship between Riyadh and Washington.</p>

But any such work on Iraq's banned missiles would have violated United Nations sanctions, even as the Security Council sought to enforce them.</p>
['elections']	<p>International election observers on Monday criticized Russia's presidential election for falling short of basic democratic standards, even as President Vladimir V. Putin accepted congratulatory telephone calls from presidents and prime ministers of the world's leading democracies.</p> <p>The observers -- representing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe -- cited the misuse of government resources, bias in state news media and even instances of ballot stuffing on Election Day.</p>

The blast flattened 1,850 homes and damaged 6,350 more, and rained debris for miles around. The official casualty toll, which is expected to climb over the weekend, was 54 dead and 1,249 injured as of Friday, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Beijing.

['books and literature', 'biographical information']	<p>IN a century when so much new music failed to speak to listeners, Dmitri Shostakovich thundered. His music expressed with lacerating wit and scorching emotional power the tragic Soviet history he lived through. In his time, premieres of his works could provoke ovations of tidal force. Today his 15 symphonies provide a harrowing index of a nation's collective memory; his 15 string quartets probe the private depths of a ruthlessly public era. Taken as a whole, his music grips contemporary audiences like that of no other modern composer. But for all its fantastic ability to communicate, what exactly does the music say?</p> <p>That question leads straight into the fiercest controversy in classical music today, a debate that has lasted almost a quarter century and is about to flare up again with the publication of two books. At its core has been an argument over Shostakovich's true identity. Was he a faithful servant of the Soviet regime, as his public behavior and official pronouncements might suggest? Or was he a secret dissident who expressed with musical signs and subtexts all the protest he could not make in words? Or did he live and work, like so many Soviet citizens, in a complicated gray area between those extremes?</p>

['books and literature']	<p>Stalin was undoubtedly a man of good taste. Like the composer Dmitri Shostakovich, he was said to have so loved one Chekhov story that he practically knew it by heart. Like Shostakovich, too, he admired Pushkin. And he was an avid fan of opera and ballet. A recording of a Mozart piano concerto may even have been playing by his bed when he died.</p> <p>So perhaps he should also be given some credit as a music critic. In fact one of his reviews, ''Muddle Instead of Music,'' which was published in 1936 in the party newspaper, Pravda, and left unsigned, succeeded in shedding unexpected light on an individual work while also making such forceful points that it altered a composer's career.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'religion and churches', 'crime and criminals', 'books and literature', 'terrorism', 'world trade center (nyc)']	<p>In the varied explanations for the 9/11 attacks and the rise in terrorism, two themes keep recurring. One is that Islamic culture itself is to blame, leading to a clash of civilizations, or, as more nuanced versions have it, a struggle between secular-minded and fundamentalist Muslims that has resulted in extremist violence against the West. The second is that terrorism is a feature of the post-cold-war landscape, belonging to an era in which international relations are no longer defined by the titanic confrontation between two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>But in the eyes of Mahmood Mamdani, a Uganda-born political scientist and cultural anthropologist at Columbia University, both those assumptions are wrong. Not only does he argue that terrorism does not necessarily have anything to do with Islamic culture; he also insists that the spread of terror as a tactic is largely an outgrowth of American cold war foreign policy. After Vietnam, he argues, the American government shifted from a strategy of direct intervention in the fight against global Communism to one of supporting new forms of low-level insurgency by private armed groups.</p>
['treaties']	<p>The European Union and Russia agreed Tuesday to extend their economic and political relationship to the union's 10 new members, most of them former Soviet republics or satellites.</p> <p>The agreement averted what could have become a conflict when the 10 countries officially join the European Union on Saturday.</p>
['airlines and airplanes']	<p>The fighter jets that landed this week at the airfield northwest of here do not pose much of a threat, but their arrival at what was once one of the Soviet Union's largest bases underlined in bold the new borders being drawn between Europe and Russia.</p> <p>The jets -- four Belgian F-16's supported by 100 Belgian, Danish and Norwegian troops -- have come to police the skies over the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, former Soviet republics that officially joined NATO on Monday along with Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>NATO formally welcomed seven new members into the alliance on Friday, stretching its security umbrella to the borders of Russia and prompting Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to reassure Moscow that it should not feel threatened.</p> <p>The NATO ministers also issued a statement calling for greater coordination against terrorism, and the new members expressed enthusiastic support for deeper NATO involvement in Iraq.</p>
['treaties', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Russia, with the last big economy outside the World Trade Organization, won support for membership in the group from the European Union on Friday and subsequently said it would support the environmental treaty on emissions known as the Kyoto Protocol.</p> <p>Russia signed a trade deal with officials representing the 25-nation European Union, Russia's biggest trading partner. The deal, after six years of negotiations, is a political victory for President Vladimir V. Putin. Russia's last remaining major hurdle to joining the 147-trade body is an agreement with the United States.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations', 'bombs and explosives', 'law and legislation', 'terrorism', 'war and revolution']	<p>A bomb exploded in a stadium in Chechnya's capital on Sunday, killing the republic's president and delivering a severe blow to President Vladimir V. Putin's efforts to end the long, deadly conflict in the region.</p> <p>As many as 13 others were killed, two officials there said, while more than 50 were reported wounded, including the Russian military commander for the region. There was no immediate claim of responsiblity.</p>
['energy and power', 'suits and litigation']	<p>Russia's largest hydroelectric dam harnesses the great Yenisei River here where the Sayan Mountains melt into Siberian steppe.</p> <p>It was once a showcase of Soviet engineering prowess, then of an emerging free market, generating power for a vast region that stretches 3,000 miles from Omsk to Chita. It is now the subject of a legal struggle at the shadowy intersection where power, property and politics in Russia collide.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>A recurring fear haunts the West's increasingly tense confrontation with Iran: Is its work on civilian nuclear power actually a ruse for making a deadly atomic arsenal, as has been the case with other countries?</p> <p>Next month, the United Nations plans to take up that question at a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna. The diplomatic backdrop includes possible sanctions and even the threat of war.</p>
['foreign investments', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Almost three years after the Sept. 11 attacks, America is still seeking sources of energy besides the Middle East, and Russia has plenty of oil to sell.</p> <p>But after numerous meetings and high-level talks, the once-promising United States-Russia energy dialogue is sputtering, say government officials and foreign and Russian energy companies.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'immigration and refugees']	<p>Senior envoys of the United States, Europe, Russia and the United Nations gave a qualified endorsement on Tuesday to the stated intention of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to withdraw from Gaza and parts of the West Bank in spite of the rejection of that plan by his own Likud Party.</p> <p>But the envoys, who were meeting at the United Nations to try to revive peace negotiations in the Middle East, stopped short of outright approval of the Israeli withdrawal plans, instead emphasizing the need for Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians and not to confront them with unilateral steps.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'elections', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Issuing a new broadside against President Bush's national security policy, Senator John Kerry said that Mr. Bush's ''almost myopic'' focus on Iraq had made Americans ''less safe'' by giving North Korea and Iran the time and opportunity to speed toward the construction of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>In an hourlong interview Friday on foreign policy, Mr. Kerry covered pre-emptive military strikes and a range of other issues. He termed the administration's approach to remaking Iraq a ''crapshoot.'' And Mr. Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, touched on a series of proposals he will make next week to limit the spread of nuclear materials, arguing all the while that Mr. Bush's assessments of threats to America were riddled with misjudgments.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>Vladimir V. Putin inaugurated his second term as president on Friday with a pledge to give Russians ''a real, tangible increase in their prosperity'' and to nurture political and social freedoms that his critics say he has gradually eroded.</p> <p>''Only free people in a free country can be genuinely successful,'' Mr. Putin said in a brief speech at the Kremlin after taking the oath of office, his right hand on a red-bound copy of the Russian Constitution. ''This is the foundation for economic growth and political stability in Russia.''</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>As patients waited in a crowded corridor outside, Dr. Zoya Mumayeva sat slumped in her tiny office, a living ruin like the bombed and vacant buildings that form the backdrop of her life.</p> <p>''It's like a fog in my head,'' she said, trying to describe her feelings. ''All I know is that I'm tired. It's been 10 years and I'm tired. It's just emptiness inside.''</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin said Wednesday that foreign ''political, economic and media pressure'' was being used in an attempt to weaken Russia's chances of competing globally.</p> <p>In a televised state of the nation speech -- his first since his re-election by an overwhelming majority in March -- Mr. Putin singled out private groups in Russia that he said claimed to support the welfare of the people but were in fact serving other foreign and domestic masters for pay.</p>

['economic conditions and trends', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations', 'social conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>In a rare visit to a war zone that has become Russia's quagmire, President Vladimir V. Putin made a quick trip on Tuesday to Chechnya, and said its bombed and battered capital, Grozny, looked ''horrible.''</p> <p>His visit, two days after the assassination of his hand-picked president for the region, Akhmad Kadyrov, was an acknowledgment that the conflict from which he has tried to distance himself remained a critical problem for the Kremlin.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>When he said goodbye to the country during his last public appearance at the 1992 convention, Ronald Reagan said he wanted to be remembered as someone who ''appealed to your greatest hopes, not your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts.''</p> <p>A modest request for The Great Communicator, but Reagan believed that if he could accomplish that feat for free people anywhere, particularly in America, he had changed the world. That's how powerful he understood basic human liberties, respect for human life and democracy to be. The Reagan creed -- freedom with optimism -- was an unstoppable force.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>As the shooting erupted here in the capital of the southern Russian region of Ingushetia on Monday night, Senior Lt. Abuyazid Kostoyev gathered four officers at the central police barracks, hurried them to a police car and sped toward the chaos they could hear outside.</p> <p>Almost immediately they came under fire. Lieutenant Kostoyev scrambled out of the car and was struck in the abdomen by a rifle bullet. He took shelter in a bakery, his only weapon a pistol against a crescendo of fire.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>A year and a half ago, Nikolai M. Girenko wrote a booklet to guide prosecutors and police officers investigating the explosion of ethnically motivated crimes by skinheads, neo-Nazis and other hate groups. It may be needed to solve his killing.</p> <p>On June 19, two young men came to his apartment here and rang the doorbell. When his daughter Katerina asked from the other side of the door what they wanted, they asked for him by name. When he approached, they shot him through the wooden door. He slumped to the floor of the apartment's small foyer and died within minutes. He was 64.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin said Friday that Russia gave intelligence reports to the Bush administration suggesting that Saddam Hussein's government was preparing terrorist attacks in the United States or against American targets overseas.</p> <p>But officials at the State Department expressed surprise, saying they knew of no such information from Russia, Reuters reported.</p>
['taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A day after President Vladimir V. Putin said his government did not want to bankrupt Yukos, an appellate court in Moscow on Friday postponed a ruling on a looming $3.4 billion tax bill that the company's executives have warned could do exactly that.</p> <p>A series of decisions by the appeals board of the Moscow Arbitration Court initially went against Yukos, the largest oil company in Russia. The court rejected efforts by Yukos to postpone hearings not only on the tax ministry's claim but also on an appeal of a ruling that the company would have to pay the bill immediately.</p>
['accidents and safety']	<p>The United States signed an agreement yesterday to protect the Titanic from admirers and would-be scavengers whose dives more than two miles into the icy abyss of the North Atlantic are damaging the increasingly fragile remains of the world's most famous shipwreck.</p> <p>Federal and private experts said the agreement, if backed by Congress, would set a legal precedent that in time could help protect thousands of other lost ships. But critics denounced it as clumsy meddling that could hurt international commerce in sunken artifacts.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The foreign minister of the new Iraqi interim government told the Security Council on Thursday that the resolution it is now considering must give Iraq full sovereignty, but he combined the appeal with a plea for the continued presence of foreign forces.</p> <p>''I stress that any premature departure of international forces would lead to chaos and the real possibility of a civil war in Iraq,'' said the official, Hoshyar Zebari.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'television', 'news and news media', 'taxation']	<p>With the oil company he founded facing bankruptcy and much of his own wealth frozen by prosecutors, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky went on trial on Wednesday on charges of fraud and tax evasion in a case that lies at the murky intersection of Russia's politics, business and law.</p> <p>Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former chairman of Yukos Oil and still Russia's richest man, appeared for the first time in an open court hearing as teams of lawyers and a lone prosecutor debated a flurry of motions in the initial stages of the country's most prominent trial since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals']	<p>An appellate court in Moscow on Wednesday upheld a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in the city, a ruling the group's leaders said reflected mounting pressure on some faiths in Russia.</p> <p>The decision culminated six years of legal proceedings. Prosecutors sought to halt the group's activities on the ground that they posed a threat to Russian society.</p>
['taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia's tax ministry and the Yukos Oil Company may try to negotiate a settlement of a $3.4 billion tax claim, a top Kremlin official said on Monday, while expressing confidence that Yukos had the ability to pay the bill.</p> <p>''As far as I know, Yukos has offered to cooperate with the tax ministry on settling the claims that have been made,'' the finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, told news agencies on Monday. ''Cooperation on the possible settlement of the claims is under way. I think Yukos has enough funds to pay its liabilities.''</p>
['medicine and health', 'books and literature']	<p>Whispers have circulated for decades that Lenin, founder of the Bolshevik Party and the totalitarian Soviet state it ushered to power, was afflicted with syphilis throughout his career. Now a new study turns that speculation into a retrospective diagnosis.</p> <p>In an article this month in The European Journal of Neurology, three Israeli physicians sift through historical references to build what they regard as a probable diagnosis that Lenin contracted the sexually transmitted disease in Europe years before he led the October Revolution in 1917. Not long after the socialists' victory, the authors write, the illness strengthened its grip, leading to an agonizing decline and, in 1924, his death.</p>

['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>At this week's NATO summit conference in Istanbul, it will be in the political interest of America's European adversaries -- France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schröder -- to appear to cooperate with the coalition helping Iraq complete its liberation.</p> <p>At the same time, it is in the political interest of George W. Bush and Britain's Tony Blair to appear to be delighted with whatever safe and cheap aid that the Chirac-Schröder bloc allows NATO to offer instead of supplying alliance troops.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Surrounded by world leaders who sounded eager to put their bitter divisions on Iraq behind them, President Bush on Tuesday welcomed the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Iraq and said the nation was solidly on the road to democracy.</p> <p>''The vote today in the United Nations Security Council was a great victory for the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Bush said as he sat with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at this seaside resort off the Georgia coast, which has been sealed off for summit talks that began here Tuesday night.

Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. $50, hardback; $24.95, paperback.</p> <p>Even though post-Communist Russia is no longer a superpower, its fate remains of great concern to the rest of the world if only because its location in the heartland of the global land mass directly affects three major regions: Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. ''Between Dictatorship and Democracy,'' sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, addresses the question of whether Russia is moving toward democracy and openness or reverting again to its autocratic traditions.</p>

['united states armament and defense']	<p>Almost everywhere in the press one reads that President Bush sounds an awful lot like Ronald Reagan. Commentators and politicians alike have drawn the comparison between Mr. Bush's ''muscular'' foreign policy and the Reagan doctrine. However macho and aggressive Mr. Bush's foreign policy may be, when it came to the Soviet Union, Mr. Reagan's was anything but.</p> <p>In 1985, Mr. Reagan sent a long handwritten letter to Mikhail Gorbachev assuring him that he was prepared ''to cooperate in any reasonable way to facilitate such a withdrawal'' of the Soviets from Afghanistan. ''Neither of us,'' he added, ''wants to see offensive weapons, particularly weapons of mass destruction, deployed in space.'' Mr. Reagan eagerly sought to work with Mr. Gorbachev to rid the world of such weapons and to help the Soviet Union effect peaceful change in Eastern Europe.</p>

['foreign aid', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush has authorized a team of American negotiators to offer North Korea, in talks in Beijing on Thursday, a new but highly conditional set of incentives to give up its nuclear weapons programs the way Libya did late last year, according to senior administration officials.</p> <p>The proposal would be the first significant, detailed overture to North Korea since Mr. Bush took office three years ago.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A Russian court on Wednesday lifted an injunction that prevented tax authorities from seizing the assets of Yukos in payment of back taxes, moving the company one step closer to a judgment on the substance of the government's $3.4 billion tax claim.</p> <p>Yukos, the oil giant built by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, does not immediately have to pay the $3.4 billion the government is seeking. Rather, the decision on Wednesday is a procedural move in the case, which the Russian Tax Ministry filed in December.</p>
['elections']	<p>The leading candidate for the presidency of Chechnya emerged Tuesday when President Vladimir V. Putin signaled support for Maj. Gen. Alu Alkhanov, the Russian republic's top police official, a man who until now was little known to the public.</p> <p>In an appearance at the Kremlin, General Alu Alkhanov, the interior minister of Chechnya, sat with Mr. Putin and said he would campaign for the office left vacant by the assassination last month of the president, Akhmad Kadyrov.</p>

Boucher, the State Department spokesman.</p> <p>Mr. Powell and the foreign minister, Paek Nam-Sun, along with their delegations, met for about 20 minutes, Mr. Boucher said, and tried to clarify their positions on proposals advanced last month, in the last round of six-party talks on North Korea.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>When Russia's Communist Party convened what might have been its grand party congress this weekend, the setting could hardly have been more bleak. The concert hall booked for the occasion was nearly half empty.

['frauds and swindling', 'taxation']	<p>Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to charges of tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement.</p> <p>''I understand the accusations presented,'' Mr. Khodorkovsky, 41, told the court. ''I do not consider myself guilty on any count.'' It was the first time he had spoken out about the charges since he was jailed last October.</p>

Lawyers for Yukos said afterward that a replacement judge would be named on Tuesday.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Moving to quell a feud for control of the Russian military and simultaneously reacting to a stinging military setback last month near Chechnya, President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday dismissed four senior military and security officers.</p> <p>Mr. Putin has rarely wanted for a dramatic gesture, and the dismissals demonstrated that point once more. Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of Russia's general staff, a rough equivalent of the Pentagon's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, topped the list of those dismissed.</p>

He faces 10 years in prison on criminal charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion related to his creation of Yukos.

['frauds and swindling']	<p>A Moscow court issued an arrest warrant on Monday for one of the top shareholders in the Russian oil company Yukos as prosecutors charged him with murder and attempted murder.</p> <p>The shareholder, Leonid B.

['taxation', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A thousand miles away in the power corridors of Moscow, the company is on the ropes. But in the swampy oil fields of Western Siberia where it makes its living, Yukos is still a world-beater.</p> <p>None of the clanking obsolescence of the Soviet-era oil industry was in sight this week when Steven M. Theede, the American chief executive of Yukos, flew to Nizhnevartovsk, near Tomsk, to cut the ribbon on a new power plant, part of the company's relentless drive to capture as much value as it can from its immense operations. Yukos built the plant to make productive use of the methane gas that occurs naturally in its oil wells, and would otherwise have to be burnt off in huge flares.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Two weeks ago, China's largest copper company signed a letter of intent to study investing in Mongolia's largest mining project.

Next month, zinc production is to start at a new $50 million Chinese mine in eastern Mongolia.</p> <p>To link it all together, Chinese aid is paying for Chinese crews this summer to pave major roads across Mongolia's grassy steppes. More may come from a $300 million loan offered by China's president when he stopped here last year.</p>

The radio cited witnesses who said he was shot by a bearded man who had stepped from a car.</p>
['taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russian authorities made further piecemeal moves on Friday to enforce a $3.4 billion tax claim against the Russian oil giant Yukos, but they also took steps not to disrupt its production of crude oil.</p> <p>Court bailiffs removed computer servers from the offices of Yukos's registrar, M-Reestr, Yukos representatives said, as investigators sought information on Yukos's three largest oil production subsidiaries: Yuganskneftegas, Yukos's largest such company, based in western Siberia; Tomskneft, which also operates in western Siberia; and Samaraneftegas, the smallest of the three, based in Samara southeast of Moscow. But bailiffs still have not made any moves to sell Yukos's biggest assets, like the three large production subsidiaries.</p>

My favorite is from August 1998 when, with Bill Clinton just three days away from a trip to Moscow, the Central Intelligence Agency reported that President Boris Yeltsin of Russia was dead.</p> <p>In 1998 the news that Mr. Yeltsin had died was, of course, no more surprising than the news, in 2003, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. It matched what we knew of his health and habits, and the secretive handling of his earlier illnesses. Nor was anyone puzzled by the lack of an announcement. Russia's financial crash 10 days earlier had set off a political crisis, and we assumed a fierce Kremlin succession struggle was raging behind the scenes.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Russian government took steps on Tuesday to seize and sell -- at a hefty discount, some feared -- the prize oil asset of Yukos, as payment for the company's back tax bill.</p> <p>Investors were dismayed to learn that the government planned to seize Yuganskneftegaz, which produces roughly 60 percent of all Yukos oil, or about as much as Indonesia.</p>
['biographical information', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Pity, if you can, the richest man in Russia. With a fortune estimated at $15 billion, Mikhail Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion and faces a 10-year jail term. His oil company, Yukos, has been hit with a tax bill of $3.4 billion, and the government is threatening to seize its most valuable assets. Although many nations, including America, tend to err on the side of courtesy to wealthy defendants, Russia does not: denied bail since his arrest in October, Khodorkovsky has not been allowed to prepare for trial from the comfort of one of his mansions, and when he is brought to court, he is placed in a metal cage.</p> <p>In today's Russia, wealth attracts trouble. President Vladimir Putin, eager to punish billionaires who oppose his rule, has chosen to make an example of Khodorkovsky, though Khodorkovsky is not the first to face Putin's selective wrath. Not long ago, Boris Berezovsky, a billionaire power broker in Moscow in the 1990's, chose exile in London to the metal cage that might have been his fate if he stayed in Russia. Vladimir Gusinsky, a media baron, was next up: forced to sell his empire at fire-sale prices, Gusinsky must now content himself with exile in Israel.</p>

['terrorism', 'religion and churches']	<p>On Monday, against the backdrop of the terrorist attack in Beslan, President Vladimir Putin of Russia held a remarkable four-hour discussion with a small group of American and Western European journalists and analysts at his official residence at Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow.

Instead, President Putin turned it into a very personal exercise in public diplomacy.</p> <p>Why did he meet with a group of foreigners at this critical juncture? Clearly, he was sending a message that he needs the United States and Europe to pay careful attention as he responds to the massacre. More specifically, he was saying three things: first, the situation in the North Caucasus is no longer just about Chechnya but involves dozens of potential ethnic and religious conflicts across the region; second, the West must stop simply criticizing me for the war in Chechnya without offering me any realistic solutions; and third, some things you are doing are making it much more difficult for me to resolve the situation.</p>

Duelfer, adds considerable detail to revelations of impropriety in the oil-for-food program disclosed by Congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office. Mr. Duelfer's report describes how Iraq created a global bribery network, directing lucrative oil vouchers to Russia, France, Belarus and other countries ''on a lavish and almost indiscriminate scale.'' The vouchers allowed the recipients to buy oil from Iraq and resell it at a profit, a lucrative opportunity to benefit from acting as middlemen. They were doled out by Iraq in part to build opposition to United Nations restrictions imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait.</p>

Putin said Monday that international terrorists in Iraq hoped their attacks would unseat President Bush in the election next month, and that such an outcome might embolden their efforts and lead to more terrorist acts.</p> <p>Mr. Putin spoke at a news conference at a regional meeting in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. A transcript was provided here by the Kremlin. He was asked how the war in Iraq would influence the election, and which candidate -- President Bush or Senator John Kerry -- would be better for him personally.</p>

['terrorism', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin may have cowed Russia's national political leadership with his plan to concentrate still more power in the Kremlin, but in regions of the country that stand to lose the most, he has inflamed fierce popular discontent.</p> <p>People in this region along the Volga denounced Mr. Putin's proposal to end direct elections of governors and other regional leaders as unconstitutional and potentially destabilizing. They fear that the Kremlin is planning further steps to recreate a Soviet-like power over the people.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'biographical information', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>As New York and Washington were under attack on Sept. 11, 2001, a film crew happened to come upon John Kerry leaving the Capitol. The brief moment of footage, included in a BBC documentary called ''Clear the Skies,'' tells us something, perhaps, about Kerry in a crisis. The camera captures Congressional aides and visitors, clearly distraught and holding onto one another, streaming down the back steps of the Capitol building in near panic, following the bellowed instructions of anxious police. Off to one side of the screen, there is Kerry, alone, his long legs carrying him calmly down the steps, his neck craning toward the sky, as if he were watching a gathering rainstorm. His face and demeanor appear unworried. Kerry could be a man lost in his thoughts who just happens to have wandered onto the set of a disaster film.</p> <p>''I remember looking up at the sky as I walked down the steps,'' Kerry told me recently, when I asked him about the film clip. He said that he and other members of the Senate's Democratic leadership had just watched on television as the second plane hit the World Trade Center, and shortly after that they heard the sonic boom of an explosion and saw, through a large window, the black smoke rise from the Pentagon. ''We'd had some warning that there was some airplane in the sky. And I remember seeing a great big plane -- I think it was a 747 or something -- up there, but it wasn't moving in a way that, you know, I was particularly concerned. I remember feeling a rage, a huge anger, and I remember turning to somebody and saying, 'This is war.' I said, 'This is an act of war.'''</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'biological and chemical warfare', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Saddam Hussein saw his life as an unfolding epic narrative, with retreats and advances, but always the same ending. He would go down in history as the glorious Arab leader, as the Saladin of his day. One thousand years from now, schoolchildren would look back and marvel at the life of The Struggler, the great leader whose life was one of incessant strife, but who restored the greatness of the Arab nation.</p> <p>They would look back and see the man who lived by his saying: ''We will never lower our heads as long as we live, even if we have to destroy everybody.'' Charles Duelfer opened his report on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction with those words. For a humiliated people, Saddam would restore pride by any means.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>The Security Council unanimously passed a Russian-initiated antiterror resolution on Friday that declared all intentional acts of violence against civilians unjustifiable by any political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic or religious considerations.</p> <p>''This statement is clear, and it doesn't have loopholes,'' said John C. Danforth, the American ambassador to the United Nations. ''The resolution which we have adopted states very simply that the deliberate massacre of innocents is never justifiable in any cause. Never.''</p>
['treaties']	<p>The long-delayed Kyoto Protocol on global warming overcame its last critical hurdle to taking effect around the world on Thursday when Russia's cabinet endorsed the treaty and sent it to Parliament. The treaty, the first to require cuts in emissions linked to global warming, would take effect 90 days after Parliament's approval, a formality that was widely expected.</p> <p>The United States has rejected the treaty and will not be bound by its restrictions. But the treaty, which has already been ratified by 120 countries will take effect if supporters include nations accounting for at least 55 percent of all industrialized countries' 1990-level emissions. The only way for it to cross that threshold was with ratification by Russia. In 1990, the United States accounted for 36.1 percent of emissions from industrialized countries, and Russia 17.4 percent.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'international trade and world market', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'ethics', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Congressional investigators say that France, Russia and China systematically sabotaged the former United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq by preventing the United States and Britain from investigating whether Saddam Hussein was diverting billions of dollars.</p> <p>In a briefing paper given yesterday to members of the House subcommittee investigating the program, the investigators said their review of the minutes of a United Nations Security Council subcommittee meeting showed that the three nations ''continually refused to support the U.S. and U.K. efforts to maintain the integrity'' of the program.</p>

Duelfer, which was released Wednesday.</p>
['reform and reorganization']	<p>Russia's lower house of Parliament took its first step on Friday toward adopting President Vladimir V. Putin's overhaul of the country's political system, despite signs of popular dissent, particularly in regions distant from the capital.</p> <p>After demonstrators protested the changes at a second day of rallies in Moscow, the lower house voted overwhelmingly to accept a core part of Mr. Putin's proposals: replacing popular elections of governors and other leaders of Russia's 89 regions with Kremlin appointments.</p>
['treaties']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday signed Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the Kremlin announced, clearing the way for the international treaty aimed at reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases to take effect early next year.</p> <p>With Mr. Putin's signature, Russia became the 126th country to ratify the treaty, but one of the most important ones after the United States, Australia and others rejected it.</p>
['espionage']	<p>A jury in Siberia convicted a physicist on Friday of spying for China, overturning a previous jury's acquittal after a closed trial that highlighted flaws in Russia's judicial system.</p> <p>The jury rendered its verdict on the central espionage charge against the physicist, Valentin V. Danilov, even though the court's judges have yet to hold a hearing to decide whether the information he is accused of passing along is even secret, his lawyer said. That hearing is now scheduled for Wednesday.</p>

He repeated for emphasis his sharp response to Secretary General Kofi Annan's ''interfering with our ability to get information we need'' about the oil-for-food scandal.</p> <p>Judith Miller of The Times had revealed that the Minnesota Republican, joined by ranking Democrat Carl Levin, sent a letter noting Annan's four-month foot-dragging and that ''the U.N. is hindering our efforts to obtain relevant documents.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'budgets and budgeting', 'finances', 'elections']	<p>The crisis in Ukraine is seen primarily as a political split between east and west. But the worry is that an economic rift could emerge as well -- with the country's industry-heavy eastern half allied with Russia and the western half left to rely on trade with Europe.</p> <p>But analysts and experts say Ukraine's economy is more complicated -- that both regions have economic ties that can contrast sharply with its political ties and are dependent on both trading partners.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In a defeat for the Bush administration, the 35-country ruling board of the International Atomic Energy Agency passed a mildly worded resolution on Monday welcoming Iran's total freeze on a sensitive part of its nuclear program.</p> <p>The resolution, passed by consensus without a vote, removes the possibility that the group will drag Iran before the United Nations Security Council for possible censure or even sanctions.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'foreign investments', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'finances', 'suits and litigation', 'taxation']	<p>The American chief executive of Yukos, the embattled oil producer whose top executives left Russia a week ago because they feared government prosecution, said yesterday that he ''fully intends'' to return to Moscow next month to run the company.</p> <p>Steven M. Theede, a longtime ConocoPhillips executive who has been Yukos's chief since June, also said that Russia's treatment of the company -- which sits at the eye of a political and financial storm there -- will send a message that Western investment in Russia is riskier than is widely believed. The government says Yukos owes it $24 billion in back taxes.</p>
['elections']	<p>On the Friday before the disputed Ukrainian election plunged the former Soviet republic into political crisis, President Bush asked Senator Richard G. Lugar to carry a letter to Ukraine's departing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, threatening consequences should there be improprieties in the voting.</p> <p>But just over a week later, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had declared the results of the election ''absolutely clear'' even as international monitors were reporting widespread fraud and abuse, Mr. Bush took a far more conciliatory position. Speaking near his ranch in Texas on Monday, he said he hoped the impasse would be resolved in a way that brought ''credit and confidence'' to a young democratic government that has been independent from the former Soviet Union for only 13 years.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>It seems as though building castles in the air and great utopias is a Russian specialty. Many Russians have long believed that we live in an ''improper'' country while the United States is a ''proper'' place, a nation with intelligent and decent government headed by a wise leader. I would like to think that the dashing of this myth in the last few years is an indicator of a certain degree of maturity.</p> <p>Little by little, we have begun to understand that the genius of today does not pursue politics; it manifests itself in other things: arts, science, etc. The world is ruled by ordinary people. There is nothing bad about that -- to the contrary, an ordinary person as a leader seems more befitting the spirit of democracy. By that light, John Kerry and George Bush seemed to me to be equals, ordinary men differing in style but not substance, a feeling that seems confirmed by Mr. Bush's small margin of victory.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia celebrated a holiday on Sunday that under the Julian calendar was in October, that commemorates the beginnings of a state that no longer exists. It used to be called the Day of the Great October Socialist Revolution, but is now the Day of Accord and Reconciliation or, sometimes, the reverse. Anyway, neither was much in evidence.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of Communists and their supporters marched in Moscow and other cities to honor the 87th anniversary of the revolution that swept the Bolsheviks to power. They were energized this year not only by revolutionary nostalgia and ideological zeal, but also by concern over a proposal to legislate away the holiday itself.</p>

''See that large building with the boarded-up windows?'' he says. ''It's going to be either a Four Seasons hotel, or maybe commercial office space.''</p> <p>In one of the minister's first privatizations in the former Soviet republic, the 330-room Iveria hotel was sold at auction to German investors in September. As part of the $2.3 million purchase price, the investors bought out more than 1,000 refugees from a civil war here in the early 1990's who were still living in the Iveria, in what was supposed to be temporary housing. Each of the 270 families was to receive $7,000 -- market price, but not in downtown Tbilisi -- for a new apartment.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'frauds and swindling', 'elections']	<p>Not since NATO's war in Kosovo, or perhaps the cold war itself, have the political differences between Russia and the West appeared so starkly as they have in Ukraine's disputed presidential election.</p> <p>It is not just that Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin himself have come out so strongly for the candidate promising closer relations with Moscow, Viktor F. Yanukovich, while Europe and the United States are supporting Viktor A. Yushchenko, albeit more subtly.</p>
['taxation', 'ethics', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Top executives at the Russian oil giant Yukos, including the company's American chief executive and chief financial officers, have left the country, saying they fear prosecution as part of the company's continuing power struggle with the Kremlin.</p> <p>All six members of Yukos's management committee have now left Russia, including the company's chief executive, Steven M. Theede, an American citizen. Mr. Theede will be traveling in Europe and the United States in the coming days, a Yukos spokesman said.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>President Bush increased the administration's pressure on Iran on Saturday, saying there were indications that the country was speeding forward in its production of a key ingredient for nuclear weapons fuel, a move he said was ''a very serious matter'' that undercut Iran's denials that it was seeking to build weapons.</p> <p>On the first day here of the annual gathering of Pacific Rim leaders, his first summit meeting since winning re-election, Mr. Bush also tried to re-establish a unified front against the other nuclear challenge facing his second term: North Korea.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell opened a new drive on Thursday to enlist Russia, China, South Korea and Japan to press North Korea to rejoin talks aimed at ending its nuclear arms program, but American officials said they could not be sure when the talks would resume.</p> <p>A senior administration official, briefing reporters after Mr. Powell met with the Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, said that recent indications from South Korea and others had been ''mildly encouraging'' that North Korea was committed to the regional talks but that no date for their resumption was in sight.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, on the second day of a mission to strengthen security ties across Central and South America, received an unambiguous promise on Friday that Nicaragua would destroy all of its portable antiaircraft missiles supplied by the Soviet Union and Cuba during the 1980's.</p> <p>More than 2,000 of the shoulder-fired SA-7 missiles remained in the Nicaraguan arsenal at the start of this year, a potent remnant of a time when the former Sandinista government here received military assistance from the Communist world.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin warned Russia's business elite on Tuesday to ''get used to paying taxes and observing the law,'' but he also sought to allay investor fears that the Kremlin might be preparing new attacks on Russian business.</p> <p>Speaking at the annual meeting of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Russia's main business lobby, Mr. Putin sought to counter the fallout from the Kremlin-backed attack on the oil giant Yukos, which has been severely weakened by the government's pursuit of $18.4 billion in back taxes. The Yukos affair has prompted capital flight and investor anxiety about the commitment to property rights in Russia.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'frauds and swindling', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>The government of Ukraine on Wednesday ignored reports of widespread government fraud in Sunday's election and certified the current prime minister as president-elect, moves Secretary of State Colin L. Powell swiftly condemned. With unrest growing on the streets here, the declared loser called for a general strike and a new election.</p> <p>''If the Ukrainian government does not act immediately and responsibly, there will be consequences for our relationship, for Ukraine's hopes for a Euro-Atlantic integration and for individuals responsible for perpetrating fraud,'' Mr. Powell said in Washington. ''We cannot accept this result as legitimate.'' [Page A14.]</p>
['terrorism', 'public opinion', 'elections']	<p>President Bush's electoral victory was greeted internationally on Wednesday with a mixture of praise, disappointment and pragmatic resignation as world leaders jostled to congratulate the president while seeking to influence his foreign policy agenda for the second term.</p> <p>From street corners, parliament halls and palaces, politicians and sidewalk pundits offered Mr. Bush unsolicited advice on how to strengthen America's effectiveness overseas by improving working relations with its allies and fulfilling a longstanding pledge to push for a permanent peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Voters in Ukraine waited in the early-morning hours on Monday for clear results of the runoff presidential election between two candidates who represent very different courses for a nation bridging Russia and the West.</p> <p>Polls closed Sunday at 8 p.m. after a mostly calm day in the capital. There were reports of scattered violence in outlying regions, and of supporters for both candidates claiming that voting had been marked by ballot-stuffing, falsification and efforts to intimidate and disenfranchise voters at the polls.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights', 'law and legislation']	<p>Ten days after President Bush signed into law a bill easing the way for North Koreans to win political asylum in the United States, a North Korean man jumped from a neighboring building onto the roof of the American Consulate in Vladivostok, Russia, entered the building and asked for asylum.</p> <p>''He's still here,'' an American consular official said by telephone on Friday, speaking of the man who entered the premises in late October. Citing federal privacy rules, the official added: ''We are working the case. There is not a resolution.''</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Here's a suggestion for President Bush from the protesters behind the democratic ''orange revolution'' here: Wear an orange tie.</p> <p>''If he wore an orange tie, people here would be crying,'' said Yuri Maluta, a protester from Lviv. ''It would show that the American president supports democracy here.''</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin waded deep into Ukraine's electoral crisis on Thursday, dismissing the challenger's demand for a repeat of the disputed presidential runoff election and criticizing European efforts to mediate.</p> <p>Mr. Putin made his remarks during a meeting with President Leonid D. Kuchma, who made an unexpected trip to Russia even as Ukrainian lawmakers wrangled over the details of holding new elections and the Supreme Court heard arguments to nullify the results of the vote on Nov. 21, which was tainted by allegations of widespread fraud.</p>
['public opinion', 'religion and churches', 'children and youth', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Muhammad Shahrour, a layman who writes extensively about Islam, sits in his engineering office in Damascus, Syria, arguing that Muslims will untangle their faith from the increasingly gory violence committed in its name only by reappraising their sacred texts.</p> <p>First, Mr. Shahrour brazenly tackles the Koran. The entire ninth chapter, The Sura of Repentance, he says, describes a failed attempt by the Prophet Muhammad to form a state on the Arabian Peninsula. He believes that as the source of most of the verses used to validate extremist attacks, with lines like ''slay the pagans where you find them,'' the chapter should be isolated to its original context.</p>
['ethics', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Bush administration said Thursday that it had faith in Secretary General Kofi Annan and did not want to see him leave office, its first show of support for the United Nations official since calls for his resignation last week.</p> <p>''We are expressing confidence in the secretary general and in his continuing in office,'' Ambassador John C. Danforth said to reporters who had been alerted by the United States mission that Mr. Danforth would be delivering an important message.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Ukraine's ''orange revolution'' was either a mass outpouring of popular will or the collapse of an enfeebled authoritarian power.</p> <p>Or maybe it was the political and judicial maturation of a teenage democracy. Or it was a Western plot concocted in the corridors of American power and carried out with cunning by subversive forces like the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. (The latter is the theory favored in parts north and east of here, particularly in the Kremlin.)</p>
['accidents and safety', 'elections', 'atomic energy']	<p>OUTSIDE, a hard winter's afternoon settles on the village, but inside their cottage Nikolai and Nastia lay out a spread: apples from their orchard, pickles from their garden, mushrooms from the woods around and full glasses of samogon, otherwise known as Ukrainian moonshine. Samogon, the locals say, offers protection from radioactivity, a consideration since we are in a ''black village'' written off for human occupation in 1986 after the explosion of Reactor 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power station a mere dozen miles away.</p> <p>''You grow your own food?'' a guest asks.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'elections', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin's steady accretion of power over Russian business, as over politics and society, hit another obstacle, this time in a courthouse in faraway Houston. This is fast becoming a trend.</p> <p>The United States Bankruptcy Court acted to restrain Russia's gas monopoly and its potential lenders from taking part in the auctioning of Yukos Oil's main subsidiary. That ruling, on Thursday, will probably not save the oil company from its state-orchestrated annihilation.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'foreign aid', 'elections']	<p>Russian leaders, many Ukrainians and even some members of Congress are asking whether the $58 million the United States spent to promote democracy in Ukraine over the past two years was actually intended to oust the government there.</p> <p>The Bush administration insists that its effort to influence the conduct of the Ukrainian election is nonpartisan. Government officials say the political training programs Washington has sponsored in Ukraine are no different from those in a dozen other countries in recent years.</p>
['foreign investments', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>It took less than six minutes on Sunday to drive Russia back in time.</p> <p>After successfully luring billions of dollars from foreign investors who believed that capitalism was finally making strides in Russia, Moscow switched directions on Sunday with a snap auction to dismantle the oil giant Yukos that set off criticism both at home and abroad.</p>
['finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>An oil company controlled by the Russian government, Rosneft, said yesterday that it had bought the company that had won Sunday's auction for the largest subsidiary of the oil giant Yukos.</p> <p>In turn, Rosneft is scheduled to merge sometime next year with Gazprom, Russia's natural gas monopoly, which had widely been thought to be the government's choice to win the auction in the first place.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'elections']	<p>The Kremlin's words reached a shrill peak on Wednesday over the election crisis in Ukraine, as Russian officials here dusted off cold war vocabulary and summoned bitter visions of lost imperial ambitions and fears of Western meddling in Russia's sphere of influence.</p> <p>The words began flowing in earnest over the weekend, as a Kremlin political strategist, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, voiced what many Russians fear is the true cause of the Ukrainian political crisis: that the West is using Ukraine as a testing ground for a ''revolution'' that may subsequently spread to Russia.</p>
['religion and churches', 'elections']	<p>THE election crisis unfolding in Ukraine is a foretaste of the problems the European Union will confront in coming decades at its eastern edge. To be sure, what is being played out in Kiev has little to do with the West. Ukraine's democratic revolution was delayed for 13 years by former Soviet bosses who recycled themselves as nationalist politicians, ''privatizing'' into their own hands the assets of the Communist state. For a decade, President Leonid Kuchma has enriched his family (and debased his country) by pursuing his ''Ukrainian way forward'': avoiding, as he explained back in 1995, ''blindly copying foreign experience.'' Many Ukrainians have finally had enough.</p> <p>But a more democratic Ukraine would pose a conundrum for Europe. Unlike Poland or the Czech Republic, Ukraine was not a captive satellite state: it was part of the Soviet Union itself. Its ties to Russia go back a very long way: it was Ukrainian villages that Potemkin spruced up for Catherine the Great on her 1787 tour of inspection. Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev were ethnic Russians from Ukraine (Russians today constitute about one-sixth of the national population, primarily in the southeast). The country's natural resources -- agriculture, coal, titanium -- were a vital element of the Soviet economy. While making up just 2.7 percent of the land area of the Soviet Union, Ukraine generated nearly 18 percent of its gross national product. Little wonder that President Vladimir Putin of Russia now feels no compunction about interfering in Ukrainian elections. This is not just another Central European state hoping to escape out of its history and into ''Europe'': this is Russia's (very) near west.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'war and revolution', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'elections']	<p>After weeks of deliberations, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, announced his new cabinet on Thursday night, offering a lineup largely free of wartime commanders and heavy on technocrats.</p> <p>Mr. Karzai, who indicated in recent comments that he wanted ministers who would not spend their time on politics, has largely purged the cabinet of so-called jihadis, regional military commanders who led forces of mujahedeen, or holy warriors, against the Soviet occupying army and then the Taliban.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday strongly defended Russia's takeover of the main subsidiary of the Yukos oil company by a state oil company. He also expressed deep irritation at the West's support for popular uprisings in post-Soviet states and what he described as Western double standards for elections.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's remarks, made at an annual holiday-season news conference in the Kremlin, amounted to a forceful restatement of widely known positions and a sometimes layered explanation of the views driving Russia in an increasingly autocratic direction this year. But even as Mr. Putin maintained a calm demeanor, at times speaking softly, his statements were notable for their sharp tone.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives', 'crime and criminals', 'elections']	<p>Tatyana and Alyona Morozov hired a former state security agent to represent their interests in the trial of two men accused of transporting explosives used in the bombing of a Moscow apartment in 1999 that killed dozens of people, including their mother. Now they are trying to get him out of jail.</p> <p>The former agent, Mikhail Trepashkin, who had worked for both the K.G.B. and its successor, the F.S.B., was sentenced in May to four years in prison for revealing state secrets during his investigation with liberal legislators of the apartment bombing and two others that killed 243 people in Moscow and southern Russia in 1999.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'atomic energy']	<p>Despite a renewed American effort to repair relations with Europe, a disagreement between the Bush administration and European leaders over how best to persuade Iran to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program has deepened in recent weeks, diplomats on both sides say.</p> <p>The diplomats said the disagreement focused on what Europeans maintained was the crucial next step in their drive to persuade Iran to move beyond its recently agreed voluntary suspension of uranium enrichment activities to the point of abandoning them outright.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'terrorism', 'news and news media', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia's lower house of Parliament overwhelmingly voted to give preliminary approval on Friday to a counterterrorism law that would hand the Kremlin broad powers to declare states of emergency, restrict free speech and clamp down on communications, organizations and the news media in cases of terrorist threats or attacks.</p> <p>Legislators voted 385 to 47 in favor of the law, which must pass two more readings in the lower house, the Duma, before being handed over to the upper chamber, the Federation Council. The main opposition came from the Communist Party and the handful of independent members of the Duma.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'public opinion', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The presidential candidate appeared for a hushed meeting an hour before midnight on Sept. 5, arriving in a black Mercedes-Benz at an exclusive dacha outside the capital here. He was accompanied by a campaign manager. He had left his bodyguards behind.</p> <p>Waiting for the candidate, Viktor A. Yushchenko, were two leaders of the Security Service of Ukraine, or S.B.U., the country's successor to the K.G.B., including Gen. Ihor P. Smeshko, its chairman. Mr. Yushchenko was leading in the presidential race. He had sought the meeting to discuss, among other things, death threats against him.</p>
['finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Russia dismantled its largest oil producer, Yukos, on Sunday by auctioning off the company's largest subsidiary to a little-known concern that registered as a last-minute bidder on Friday.</p> <p>Gazprom, the country's natural gas monopoly and the Kremlin-favored front-runner to buy the Yukos property, did not even make a bid.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>The man declared the winner of Ukraine's disputed presidential election, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, said Tuesday that he was prepared to accept a new vote and offered not to run again as long as his challenger also stepped aside.</p> <p>Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader who claims to have won the election on Nov. 21, immediately dismissed the proposal, along with Mr. Yanukovich's offer to appoint him as prime minister and consider amendments to the Constitution that would share power between the country's starkly divided blocs.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>The elder President Bush's most memorable foreign-policy blunder took place in Kiev in 1991, then under Communist rule. With the Soviet Union coming apart, the U.S. president -- badly advised by the stability-obsessed ''realist'' Brent Scowcroft -- made a speech urging Ukrainians yearning for independence to beware of ''suicidal nationalism.'' His speech, which he now insists meant only ''not so fast,'' was widely taken as advice to remain loyal to Moscow's empire.</p> <p>I dubbed this the ''Chicken Kiev'' speech. That so infuriated Bush, who mistakenly saw the phrase as imputing cowardice rather than charging colossal misjudgment, that he has not spoken to me since.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader, appeared headed for a resounding victory early Monday in a riveting presidential race marked by intrigue, charges of poisoning, fervent street demonstrations and widespread abuses of state power.</p> <p>There were no independent reports of the egregious election violations that had discredited the previous round of voting. Mr. Yushchenko, addressing supporters at this headquarters, predicted an end at last to an extended and bitter election season.</p>
['elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>With speculation running rampant in Ukraine over who was behind the mysterious dioxin poisoning of the presidential candidate Viktor A. Yushchenko, the use of poisons as a sinister tool of statecraft has again entered the public arena in a former Soviet republic. Some former officers of the Russian security services argue that it never left.</p> <p>On several occasions in the past decade, the successor agencies to the K.G.B. in Russia and other countries once in the Soviet sphere have come under suspicion of giving drugs or poisons to prominent critics. And while the authorities have repeatedly denied ordering such actions, the former intelligence officials say they find many of the allegations credible.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>In these long winter nights, a headless horseman is roaming Russia's ''near abroad,'' threatening independent countries and raising fears of a renewed cold war.</p> <p>This specter is Vladimir Putin. Let's hope he finds his head soon.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The United States and Russia are close to signing an agreement to help control the trafficking of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, a weapon highly prized by terrorists, the Russian defense minister said during a visit here on Tuesday.</p> <p>The minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said the deal had been negotiated rapidly during the past several months, and he predicted that ''this agreement is sure to be signed pretty soon.''</p>
['social conditions and trends', 'law and legislation']	<p>Facing an unusual wave of public protest, President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday pointedly criticized the government he had appointed for mishandling a new law replacing social benefits for retirees with cash payments that have been derided as meager.</p> <p>Meeting with his government ministers, Mr. Putin called for raising and accelerating an increase in pensions scheduled to take effect in April. He defended the new law, but said that the changes in social benefits, which his government pushed through Parliament over opposition protests last year, should not punish Russia's poorest citizens.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'united states armament and defense', 'elections']	<p>President Bush said Wednesday that the elections this weekend in Iraq would be ''a grand moment in Iraqi history'' that he described as part of a global march toward freedom. Yet he acknowledged that Iraqis themselves had not yet taken the initiative in defending their country and might doubt Washington's will to prevail against the insurgency.</p> <p>Mr. Bush's assessment, in the first news conference of his second term, was made on the deadliest day of the war for American forces.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>Viktor A. Yushchenko, still basking in the glow of the street protests that swept him to power in Ukraine, appeared here on Friday to ask for help in creating ''a prosperous Ukraine in a successful, united Europe.''</p> <p>''I'm addressing you as a president,'' Mr. Yushchenko told the World Economic Forum's gathering of high-powered business executives, men, world leaders and intellectuals here. ''Please help Ukraine, and quite shortly, you'll see a European, beautiful nation.''</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Viktor A. Yushchenko, his face disfigured by poison and his fate nearly undone by electoral fraud, took the oath of office as president of Ukraine on Sunday, vowing to unite a poor and deeply divided country and lead it into the mainstream of Europe.</p> <p>Speaking first in Parliament and then in Kiev's central square, Mr. Yushchenko declared Ukraine's freedom and independence in thinly veiled remarks aimed at the departing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, and at Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, who openly supported Mr. Yushchenko's opponent.</p>
['law and legislation', 'demonstrations and riots', 'finances', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Mikhail I. Yermakov, a retired engineer, has never before taken to the streets to protest -- not when the Soviet Union collapsed, the wars in Chechnya began, the ruble plummeted in 1998 or President Vladimir V. Putin last year ended his right to choose his governor.</p> <p>On Saturday, however, he joined hundreds of others in the central square of this gritty industrial city on the edge of Moscow in the latest of a weeklong wave of protests across Russia against a new law abolishing a wide range of social benefits for the country's 32 million pensioners, veterans and people with disabilities.</p>
['elections', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution', 'biological and chemical warfare']	<p>Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's nominee for secretary of state, refused Tuesday to set any timetable for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, but declared that the United States was making ''some progress'' in training Iraqi security forces.</p> <p>Under persistent bipartisan questioning at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ms. Rice also declared that beyond strengthening Iraq's fledgling police and military, the most urgent task facing Iraqis after the elections was to overcome differences among Sunni Arabs, Shiites, Kurds and others by seeking political reconciliation among themselves.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Ukraine's Parliament voted Thursday to inaugurate Viktor A. Yushchenko as the country's next president on Sunday, nearly three months after the first votes were cast.</p> <p>Mr. Yushchenko's inauguration -- only the country's third since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 -- will end an electoral crisis that prompted huge public demonstrations and behind-the-scenes intrigue, that deeply divided the country and that soured relations with Russia.</p>
['elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday abruptly reduced the responsibilities of a senior adviser who last week issued a sweeping criticism of the Kremlin's leadership and expressed deep misgivings about the direction in which Russia was headed.</p> <p>In a presidential decree released without further comment, Mr. Putin relieved the adviser, Andrei N. Illarionov, of his duties as Russia's envoy to the Group of 8, comprising the world's major industrialized nations and Russia. Mr. Putin reassigned those duties to a presidential aide who is seemingly a more loyal Kremlin insider, Igor I. Shuvalov.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>When the streets of the capital of Ukraine were filled with protesters a few weeks ago, the mayor of Gdansk, this battered, history-laden city on the Baltic, climbed up a ladder to drape a scarf in the Ukraine protest movement's trademark bright orange around the neck of a statue of Neptune, Gdansk's maritime symbol.</p> <p>''We remember when there was the Solidarity movement in Gdansk, and the people of the free world helped us here,'' Mayor Pawel Adamowicz said in his office this week. He was explaining what he called the emotional component of his gesture of identification with the Ukrainian orange revolution.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>The Russian woman in the cafe was in tears, her tea cooling, her potato salad untouched. She had just endured an hourlong interrogation by a South Korean investigator about her role in sheltering a North Korean defector.</p> <p>''I had no idea they could talk like that to a Russian citizen,'' said the woman, who asked only to be identified by her first name, Katia, the gold cross on her sweater flashing as she trembled from her ordeal at the South Korean Consulate here.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'atomic weapons', 'elections']	<p>President Bush expressed concern on Thursday night about Russia's commitment to democracy in a sometimes tense and awkward encounter with President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin, at times visibly uncomfortable, refused to yield.</p> <p>''Democracies have certain things in common -- a rule of law and protection of minorities and a free press and a viable political opposition,'' Mr. Bush said after a private meeting that lasted more than an hour, chiding Mr. Putin gently though more directly than ever before. ''I was able to share my concerns about Russia's commitment in fulfilling these universal principles.''</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>For all of the advance billing and anticipation, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia emerged from their private meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia on Thursday and chose to stand together and emphasize the narrowing areas where their nations could agree.</p> <p>Much was said gently, or avoided altogether, at least in public. The presidents focused their remarks after the meeting on personal trust and on commitments to fight terrorism and control the spread of weapons or materials terrorists might use. While raised, Western concerns about the decline in the development of democracy in Russia were muted after a period in which Mr. Bush heightened expectations with soaring language on the irresistible lure of freedom and democracy.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Following are excerpts from a transcript of the news conference of President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia yesterday in Bratislava, Slovakia, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Putin's remarks were provided through a translator. A full transcript is at nytimes.com/international.</p> <p>MR. BUSH: It's very important that we establish not only a working relationship, but that we understand that in the 21st century strong countries are built by developing strong democracies. And so we talked about democracy. Democracies always reflect a country's customs and culture, and I know that. Yet democracies have certain things in common; they have a rule of law and protection of minorities, a free press and a viable political opposition.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>One of the strangest kabuki dances of George W. Bush's presidency was his news conference last week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Bratislava, Slovakia. For 34 minutes, with bits of sweat on his upper lip, Mr. Bush had to contort himself into a public reprimand of Mr. Putin for Russia's slide from democracy while asserting that their relationship was just great.</p> <p>The body language suggested otherwise. To be in the room at the medieval Bratislava Castle overlooking the Danube was to be transfixed by the spectacle of a big, friendly Labrador retriever trying to cozy up to a cat. As the presidents stood side by side at their matching lecterns, Mr. Bush smiled and gestured and tried to warm up ''Vladimir,'' who stood in icy repose, refusing to be charmed.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution', 'law and legislation']	<p>WASHINGTON isn't exactly short of foreign policy priorities these days, but before rushing into a list of new tasks for the president's second term, I would like to suggest sorting out an old one: Kosovo.</p> <p>The world reacted in horror six years ago when the Serbian regime of Slobodan Milosevic embarked on an ethnic cleansing operation against Kosovo's Albanians, forcing 700,000 people, nearly half the population, to flee the province. Reports of massacres and images of mileslong lines of refugees fleeing into neighboring Albania and Macedonia compelled the world to act. The NATO air campaign against Serbia that followed convinced Belgrade to give up its brutal assault, and Kosovo was put under United Nations administration.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech yesterday in Brussels, as provided by the White House. The full transcript is on the Web at nytimes.com/world.</p> <p>Our greatest opportunity and immediate goal is peace in the Middle East. After many false starts, and dashed hopes, and stolen lives, a settlement of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is now within reach. America and Europe have made a moral commitment: We will not stand by as another generation in the Holy Land grows up in an atmosphere of violence and hopelessness. America and Europe also share a strategic interest: By helping to build a lasting peace, we will remove an unsettled grievance that is used to stir hatred and violence across the Middle East.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush warned Russia on Monday that it ''must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law,'' but said he believed that the nation's future lay ''within the family of Europe and the trans-Atlantic community.''</p> <p>The president's words opened his first trip across the Atlantic since his re-election and were part of a speech aimed at building a new relationship with Europe after the dispute over the American-led invasion of Iraq.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Few people in President Bush's entourage seemed happier to get home from Europe late Thursday night than Mr. Bush himself, who spent his week in meetings with three of the prickliest characters in current American foreign relations -- President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p> <p>Unlike other American presidents, who often used trips to Europe as diversions from the scandals and politics of home, Mr. Bush spent four days in chocolate-making countries like Belgium eating his peas.</p>

The visiting Japanese general donned a Russian fur hat. Together, they watched Russian tanks maneuver across the snow-covered terrain.</p> <p>Japan and Russia are weaving closer military and economic relations, and the reason lies just across the Amur River from here -- China.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>President Bush's determined effort to raise Russia's crackdown on independent businesses and internal dissent with President Vladimir V. Putin when they meet this week is likely to get a tart response, according to the Russian ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov.</p> <p>In written answers to questions submitted by The New York Times before Mr. Bush left for Europe on Sunday, Mr. Ushakov said Mr. Putin was likely to respond to Mr. Bush's criticism by raising ''our own concerns about the situation in the United States and certain troubling aspects of Washington's policies.''</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>State Department and Pentagon officials are expressing renewed concern that Nicaragua may not destroy its arsenal of portable antiaircraft missiles as it promised Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld during his visit to Managua last autumn, administration officials said Tuesday.</p> <p>An American delegation was in Managua on Tuesday to renew pressure on the Nicaraguan government to destroy all of the shoulder-fired missiles supplied by the Soviet Union and Cuba during the 1980's. The American group was led by Rose Likins, the acting assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'religion and churches']	<p>The lower house of Parliament voted Friday to condemn anti-Semitism after an uproar touched off when a group of mostly nationalist and Communist legislators demanded last month that Jewish organizations be investigated and even outlawed for fomenting ethnic hatred and stimulating anti-Semitism themselves.</p> <p>But while 306 lawmakers approved the nonbinding resolution, 58 refused to endorse it. ''There should be no room for anti-Semitism or ethnic and religious hatred,'' the resolution said. ''Any steps aimed at inciting national or religious dissent and hatred must be stopped immediately.''</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>To some critics, Europe's plan to lift its arms embargo on China is simply a way to make sure its weapons makers claim a slice of one of the world's largest military budgets. But much more is at stake in Europe's decision than whether it sells French fighter jets or German submarines to Beijing -- namely broader commercial ties and some genuine diplomacy.</p> <p>That, political and military analysts here say, is why European leaders appear ready to defy the United States, which opposes lifting the embargo. The conflict has bubbled up during President Bush's visit here this week, injecting a discordant note into his otherwise harmonious tour.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>GIVEN the diplomatic challenges facing President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, it's good that they are meeting today in Bratislava, Slovakia. In doing so, they are keeping alive a useful and time-honored practice. After all, the principal occupants of the White House and Kremlin have been sitting down together since the chilliest days of the cold war. But the way things are going in Russia, it may be harder to justify Mr. Bush's next encounter with Mr. Putin at the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8 major industrialized countries at the Gleneagles resort in Perthshire, Scotland, in July.</p> <p>Members of the group (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan as well as Russia and the United States) are supposed to share a commitment to multiparty democracy, rule of law, freedom of the press, protection of human and civil rights, and respect for the sovereignty of their neighbors. Mr. Putin's concentration of power, his crackdown on the independent news media, his scorched-earth policy in Chechnya, and his bullying of Georgia and Ukraine have jeopardized Russia's membership in that club.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that he had instructed his government to begin coordinating with Palestinian leaders on Israel's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>Mr. Sharon, who a year ago announced his intention to pull all Israeli settlers out of Gaza unilaterally, insisting he had no Palestinian partner while Yasir Arafat remained alive, expressed eagerness to work with his successor, Mahmoud Abbas, on returning Gaza to Palestinian control. Mr. Arafat died in November.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'treaties', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>India, sharing a ravenous thirst for oil, has joined China in an increasingly naked grab at oil and natural gas fields that has the world's two most populous nations bidding up energy prices and racing against each other and global energy companies.</p> <p>Energy economists in the West cannot help admiring the success of both China and India in kindling their industrialization furnaces. But they also cannot help worrying about what the effect will be on energy supplies as the 37 percent of the world's population that lives in these two countries rushes to catch up with Europe, the United States and Japan. And environmentalists worry about the effects on global warming from the two nations' plans to burn more fossil fuels.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>A month ago a small crowd of elderly men and women briefly blocked the highway to Moscow's main international airport to protest changes in pension benefits. It seemed insignificant then, but in retrospect it seems to have been the first stirrings of something long considered dead, or at least dormant, in Russia: the public protest.</p> <p>In Beslan, relatives of those killed in the siege of Middle School No.1 last September blocked the main highway across the North Caucasus for three days in late January to protest the pace of the government's official investigation into the terrorist attack. On the island of Sakhalin in the Far East, ecologists joined local villagers in blocking roads leading to new oil and gas projects to protest their effect on the environment and local tribal cultures.</p>
['terrorism']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a top Russian envoy Saturday that Moscow's crackdown on dissent was making Russian-American relations ''more difficult,'' a State Department official said. But Ms. Rice also signaled in public that the United States would not try to isolate Russia because of its actions.</p> <p>The State Department official, speaking after a dinner between Ms. Rice and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, said the secretary cited Russia's steps to take over independent television, seize the oil company Yukos and arrest its leaders, and remove powers from state governors.</p>
['news and news media', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>It was remarkable to see President Bush lecture Vladimir Putin on the importance of checks and balances in a democratic society.</p> <p>Remarkably brazen, given that the only checks Mr. Bush seems to believe in are those written to the ''journalists'' Armstrong Williams, Maggie Gallagher and Karen Ryan, the fake TV anchor, to help promote his policies. The administration has given a whole new meaning to checkbook journalism, paying a stupendous $97 million to an outside P.R. firm to buy columnists and produce propaganda, including faux video news releases.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations', 'bombs and explosives', 'terrorism']	<p>The United States and France together called on Syria on Tuesday to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, just a day after the pro-Syrian government of Lebanon collapsed under popular pressure.</p> <p>In a joint appearance before reporters, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Michel Barnier, the French foreign minister, who are here for a one-day conference on supporting the Palestinian Authority, demanded the ''immediate withdrawal of all Syrian military and intelligence forces from Lebanon.''</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'ethics', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>In recent weeks, President Vladimir V. Putin's politics have generated most of the worry in the West. He has been cutting welfare benefits for veterans and pensioners, clamping down on free media and meddling in the Ukrainian election. Even President Bush, who badly needs the Kremlin's cooperation in combating terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons and narcotics trafficking, gently chided Mr. Putin about maintaining democratic standards when the two met in Bratislava last week.</p> <p>But the president's concerns about democratic principles may miss the larger point. The real threat to Russia's future could lie in the economy. For now, its gross domestic product is booming, it boasts a budget surplus and a windfall from record high oil prices. But it is pursuing a model of corrupt, state-managed capitalism, economists and political analysts say, that is inimical to democracy and could condemn its economy to perpetual third world status.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'ethics', 'economic conditions and trends', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>The loveliest street in Chechnya runs for all of a block here in the battered republic's second largest city.</p> <p>It is lined with trees, paved and washed. The buildings, new or newly renovated, include a cultural center and two shops. One deals in mobile phones, which only recently began to work in Chechnya. The other sells jewelry, including a necklace set that costs the equivalent of $19,000, an astonishing price in a place devastated by a decade of war and mired in abject poverty.</p>
['finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Midway between Okinawa and China, the Ramform Victory, a Norwegian seismic ship, is performing routine survey work, trawling with long seismic cables and using sound waves to create three-dimensional images of oil and gas deposits. But nothing is routine when Japan commissions a survey of what is hidden below the contested waters of the East China Sea.</p> <p>Chinese coast guard ships treat the surveyors as spies, radioing warnings to leave and shadowing the ship for days on end. On one occasion, the Chinese ships nearly collided with the vessel. Japan's trade minister, flying in a Japan coast guard plane, conducted an ostentatious survey, circling over the bright yellow gas production platform that China is building a mile west of waters claimed by Japan.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>THE hasty exit of President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan from his capital, Bishkek, last week is being hailed with the same breathless exuberance that greeted Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003 and the Orange Revolution that brought Viktor Yushchenko to the presidency of Ukraine in November. Democracy is on the march, we are told; yet another despot of the former Soviet world has been cast aside.</p> <p>It's a good story, but I'm afraid that plugging the political upheaval of this poor Central Asian nation into the paradigm du jour is akin to stuffing an elephant into a gorilla skin.</p>
['taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The police came at 5 a.m. that December day and, in front of her two young boys, took Svetlana Bakhmina away for questioning. After an interrogation that lasted well into the night, Ms. Bakhmina lost consciousness and had to be taken to a prison hospital. Her interrogation continued the following morning.</p> <p>Since her arrest, Ms. Bakhmina, 35, has remained in a cell with three other women. This month, she was denied bail and her detention was extended until May 2. And this midmonth, after suffering health problems, she ended a hunger strike demanding telephone privileges to call her sons, who are 3 and 7.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Two days after President Askar Akayev fled Kyrgyzstan, the country was mired in a parliamentary crisis as members from the old and newly elected Parliament vied for power.</p> <p>Moscow confirmed that Mr. Akayev had been welcomed in Russia, where he went after a groundswell of protests across the country against vote-rigging in legislative elections that ended with a runoff on March 13. But he has not resigned as president and Kyrgyzstan's new authorities are struggling to establish the legal foundation of their rule.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'news and news media', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Residents of Moldova, Europe's poorest nation, head to the polls on Sunday to elect the tiny country's new Parliament in a race that could further test the Kremlin's influence in the former Soviet sphere.</p> <p>Because Moldova's Parliament selects the president, results on Sunday are likely to determine who will become the next head of state.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>In an attack reminiscent of the dark and violent period of Russia's early years of privatization, the leader of its electricity monopoly, Anatoly B. Chubais, survived a roadside ambush on Thursday morning as he was driving here from his extravagant dacha. Mr. Chubais, 49, chief executive of Unified Energy System, is the designer of Russia's post-Soviet privatization and one of Moscow's most controversial figures. He was not harmed.</p> <p>Witnesses and the authorities said the attackers detonated a bomb or landmine as Mr. Chubais's armored BMW and a car carrying his bodyguards left the elite Zhavoronki region and approached Minsk Highway west of Moscow. At least two gunmen in the woods nearby sprayed the vehicles with automatic weapons fire.</p>

['terrorism']	<p>The killing of Aslan Maskhadov, the Chechen rebel leader and president of the republic's underground separatist government, set off a debate in Russia on Wednesday as to whether the death was a step forward or back.</p> <p>On the surface, the killing was a rare public success in Russia's Chechnya policy, in which capturing or killing prominent rebel leaders and terrorists has been a highly publicized goal. Politicians loyal to the Kremlin hailed it as a demoralizing loss to the separatists that would give Russia's security forces fresh momentum in the war.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Saudi Arabia told Syria on Thursday to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, adding substantially to Syria's international isolation just a day after Russia joined Western nations in making a similar call.</p> <p>Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, went Thursday to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, hoping to secure Saudi support before a coming Arab summit meeting. But Saudi officials told Reuters and The Associated Press that Crown Prince Abdullah had delivered an unusually blunt rebuff. Egypt, the other key Arab player, has also called for the withdrawal of Syria from Lebanon.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>In the first decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, democracy took root in most of its republics in name only. With the exception of the Baltic republics -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, now deeply entwined in Europe -- new political systems and new leaders emerged from the post-Soviet chaos promising freedoms but somehow managing to ensure that those freedoms led to the continuation of their power.</p> <p>But in the last year and a half, popular uprisings have claimed the sclerotic leadership of three former Soviet republics. In Georgia in November 2003, in Ukraine a year later and now in Kyrgyzstan, simmering discontent accomplished what not long ago seemed improbable: the peaceful overthrow of governments that ceased to represent the will of the people.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Protesters alleging corruption, repression and electoral fraud forced the longtime president of this central Asian country to flee his palace on Thursday, the third time a government of a former Soviet republic has been toppled in a popular uprising in a year and a half.</p> <p>President Askar Akayev and his family fled Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, after crowds at a large opposition rally seized control of the presidential palace and began looting it. Kyrgyzstan's Parliament elected a former opposition lawmaker, Ishenbai Kadyrbekov, as the country's interim president. It was unclear whether the decision was legally binding, in part because of uncertainty over whether Mr. Akayev, whose whereabouts were unknown, had stepped down.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'banks and banking', 'finances', 'law and legislation', 'ethics']	<p>In an effort to steady Russia's business climate, President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that he favored a change in the law that would effectively end investigations into the privatizations of the 1990's.</p> <p>Mr. Putin said he would support a law that would reduce the inquiries to 3 years from the current 10 years -- potentially clearing dozens of so-called oligarchs who gained their wealth in questionable asset sales. The law would end the possibility of inquiries into privatizations in the mid-1990's to late 1990's in oil, metals, cars and utilities.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Spain gathered for an informal meeting here on Friday and issued a joint statement urging Syria to withdraw troops and security services from Lebanon. They also said they were united in their desire to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The meeting, preceded by a lunch between President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was meant partly to bolster Russian-European Union relations and overcome growing unease with Mr. Putin's increasingly authoritarian governance. Recent restrictions on the Russian news media and increasing economic recentralization, in particular, have raised concerns in Europe.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A longtime business associate of the imprisoned Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky spoke out from self-imposed exile here on Sunday, denying criminal charges by the Russian authorities and saying the accusations against him are a continuation of a Kremlin campaign of intimidation.</p> <p>''The situation in Russia today I would describe as Stalinism,'' the associate, Leonid B. Nevzlin, said in a rare interview at his home in Herzliya, Israel's high-tech hub in the Tel Aviv suburbs. He said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ''enjoys the absolute power of one person, in that he uses the law enforcement system and the lack of free press'' to intimidate Russia's business elite and renationalize Yukos, once Russia's largest private oil company.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>The Communist Party of Moldova, a former Kremlin favorite that has turned Westward in recent years, appeared Sunday to have weathered its split with the Russian government and to have maintained the largest bloc in Moldova's Parliament, according to a survey of voters leaving the election polls.</p> <p>But the survey also suggested that the party was much weaker than when it unexpectedly rose to power four years ago, and that two opposition groups had emerged as a potent challenge to the incumbent government of President Vladimir Voronin, the Communist leader.</p>
['crime and criminals']	<p>After a scramble to restore order, Kyrgyzstan's new leaders appeared early Saturday to have succeeded in halting looting that erupted after the ouster of President Askar Akayev on Thursday.</p> <p>Initially, the looting was aimed at a shopping center and a luxury supermarket controlled by the family of Mr. Akayev, but it then spread to other areas. On Friday morning, patrols of so-called people's marshals and armed police officers, emerging for the first time since Mr. Akayev fled, were confronting looters, firing into the air to disband them, authorities said.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>After facing months of criticism for Russia's crackdown on freedoms and its concentration of presidential power, President Vladimir V. Putin said Monday that encouraging democracy was the main task before the nation and that human rights, freedom and a secure business climate were essential for the health of the state.</p> <p>In his annual address to Parliament, Mr. Putin offered a vision that at times and on the surface appeared to embrace the language of some of his most prominent critics.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Here on the southwestern edge of the Urals, a popular uprising against a regional government is posing one of the most significant challenges yet to President Vladimir V. Putin's political control, raising the possibility that civic protest may be spreading into Russia from its periphery.</p> <p>Heartened by the political upheavals in two of Russia's neighbors, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, thousands here have staged a series of demonstrations since February calling for the ouster of the president of the Bashkortostan region, Murtaza G. Rakhimov.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered reassurances on Wednesday to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and to listeners of a popular Moscow radio station that the United States would not supplant Russia's influence in its neighborhood despite growing American friendship with other countries in the region.</p> <p>But in a long day of talks and interviews in Russia, before flying here to Lithuania for a NATO meeting, Ms. Rice continued to suggest that Russia needed to do more to foster economic and political freedoms.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market']	<p>THE next big thing in investing is what the strategists and economists at brokerage houses have taken to calling the BRIC's -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. These developing countries sport high growth rates, and produce and consume prodigious quantities of commodities, from oil to soybeans.</p> <p>It's easy to see how their rapid emergence directly affects the American economy. Many discussions about the price of oil, the specter of commodity-driven inflation, and the burgeoning trade deficit begin and end with the BRIC's.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Kyrgyzstan's exiled president, Askar Akayev, has agreed in principle to step down, Kyrgyz officials said Saturday. His resignation would pave the way for the opposition government that ousted him more than a week ago to recover its constitutional footing.</p> <p>A delegation of Kyrgyz legislators will travel to Moscow on Sunday to negotiate final terms of the resignation, according to the speaker of the country's new Parliament, Omurbek Tekebayev.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons']	<p>After two senior-level meetings between North Korean and Chinese leaders over the last two weeks to discuss the North's nuclear-weapons program, the Chinese have failed so far to persuade North Korea to rejoin nuclear disarmament talks, senior administration officials and diplomats said Friday.</p> <p>As a result of the continuing deadlock, informal discussions have begun among the five parties to the talks on new, more aggressive strategies that could be used if and when it is decided that the talks have reached a dead end.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'social conditions and trends']	<p>Vladimir Putin gave a bizarre speech this week in which he described the fall of the Soviet Union as ''the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century'' and said that an ''epidemic of collapse has spilled over to Russia itself.''</p> <p>The sad thing is he is half right.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, reiterating American concerns about authoritarian trends in the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin, said Tuesday that Russia's coming leadership of the Group of 8 industrial nations next year gave it ''certain responsibilities'' to guarantee economic and political freedoms.</p> <p>Some critics of the Bush administration said Washington should threaten to remove Russia from the group if Moscow did not improve its record on human rights and democracy. Ms. Rice has repeatedly dismissed that approach as counterproductive, a position she reiterated.</p>
['suits and litigation', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Yukos, the crippled Russian oil company, has scheduled a long-postponed annual meeting for June 24 to elect a new board as it braces for more legal wrangles and the possible sale of its share in a refinery in Lithuania.</p> <p>On Friday, hearings are scheduled to begin in Moscow Arbitration Court over two lawsuits brought against Yukos by Rosneft, the state-owned oil company that won the majority of Yukos's assets in a forced government auction in December to defray a $28 billion tax bill.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'ethics', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A former senior aide to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, said on Wednesday that neither he nor anyone else in the Kremlin had received the rights from Saddam Hussein to sell Iraqi oil under a United Nations program, as a United States Senate subcommittee has charged.</p> <p>The aide, Aleksandr S. Voloshin, strongly disputed the findings of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He denied that he or any other official had made any deals in exchange for support for Iraq in its political struggle with the United States before Mr. Hussein was overthrown in 2003.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A House committee yesterday disclosed Iraqi documents that it said provided new information on what has long been seen as a campaign by Saddam Hussein to secure international support at the Security Council in exchange for lucrative oil contracts under the United Nations oil-for-food program.</p> <p>The documents, released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in advance of hearings planned for Monday, showed that Iraqi intelligence officials focused on French and Russian officials as part of what the Iraqi memos and letters described as a deliberate strategy to overcome sanctions and create divisions on the Security Council.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>President Bush met Sunday night with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in what was widely expected to be a tense encounter after days of recriminations over Russian rollbacks of democracy and the Soviet Union's actions in the World War II era, but the top foreign policy advisers to both men swiftly pronounced the meeting a success.</p> <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, appeared in an unusual joint briefing at a guest house on the grounds of Mr. Putin's presidential dacha outside Moscow to say the two leaders had talked extensively about nuclear proliferation and Israel's plan to withdraw from Gaza this summer.</p>
['war and revolution']	<p>That old nostalgia for Stalin is surfacing again. It always does around the May holidays. This delights a few die-hard Stalinists here but dismays many more people.</p> <p>The ambiguity is represented neatly in the person of Zurab Tsereteli, the closest thing Russia has to an official artist. With the 60th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany approaching, he cast a monumental bronze statue of Stalin, along with Churchill and Roosevelt, at their 1945 summit conference in Yalta. A monument to Stalin alone seemed a bit much, he acknowledged. But for most other people so, too, is the one Mr. Tsereteli created, depicting Stalin uncritically, in historical context.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>A day after the Bush administration warned North Korea against conducting a nuclear test, South Korea said Monday that it saw no clear evidence that the North was preparing to explode a weapon.</p> <p>Officials in South Korea, which resumed bilateral talks with North Korea on Monday, said they had not changed their position toward the North, rejecting for now harsher punitive actions sought by Washington. On Sunday, Stephen J. Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, said the United States had seen ''some evidence'' that the North Koreans were preparing for a nuclear test and warned of penalties.</p>
['medicine and health', 'news and news media', 'war and revolution']	<p>What with Air Force One, Marine One and the armor-plated limousine, President Bush isn't often behind the wheel. Maybe that's why he found himself struggling to get President Vladimir V. Putin's gleaming 1956 ivory-colored Volga into gear at the Russian president's dacha outside Moscow on Sunday night, in a mishap that was not caught in the pictures of the two waving merrily from the windows of the vintage Russian sedan.</p> <p>The Volga, recently purchased by Mr. Putin and so immaculately restored that it looked as if it belonged in a car museum, had been parked outside Mr. Putin's official meeting house on the dacha grounds as the two presidents held talks. Reporters were told that the two would emerge and drive the Volga the short distance to Mr. Putin's official residence, where the Bushes, the Putins and a few top aides were to have dinner.</p>
['gas (fuel)', 'energy and power', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>The Russian government outlined on Tuesday how it will gain control of Gazprom, the country's natural gas monopoly. Instead of merging Gazprom with the state-owned oil company Rosneft, as it initially planned, the Kremlin will use a more complicated deal structure.</p> <p>The government abandoned its merger plans because of fallout from its dismantling of the private oil giant Yukos and the legal assault on the founder of Yukos, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>The man carrying the hidden radioactive material passed among airline passengers at Sheremetyevo Airport here on an afternoon this year. His briefcase, holding the contraband, was indistinguishable from anyone else's carry-on bag.</p> <p>Then, as he approached the check-in counter, lights flashed and an alarm sounded. A mounted video camera captured the man's image. Uniformed guards seized the briefcase and took it to a lead-lined booth where it could be inspected without harming other passengers.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'treaties']	<p>Russia and the European Union signed a long-stalled agreement on Tuesday to forge closer economic, political and social ties, but President Vladimir V. Putin showed that deep tensions with some of the union's newest members remained when he offered pointed condemnations of their policies.</p> <p>Appearing after a summit meeting with European Union leaders here, Mr. Putin praised the agreement as a step toward the creation of a European continent ''with no dividing lines.'' But he then angrily criticized the Baltic nations -- former Soviet republics that joined the European Union last year -- for clinging to historic grievances over Soviet domination.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>The Bush administration said Wednesday that it would send 55,000 tons of food to North Korea this year, even as other American officials press ahead with plans to deprive the North of hard currency if there is no progress in efforts to end its nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>The food aid, the same amount as last year, was announced just as China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the United States are trying to lure North Korea back to talks that have been stalled for a year. But a State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, said in announcing the decision that there was no linkage to the nuclear issue. ''Our decisions are made on humanitarian considerations solely,'' he told reporters.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'atomic weapons', 'taxation']	<p>President Bush criticized Senate Democrats on Tuesday for ''stalling'' a vote on John R. Bolton's nomination as ambassador to the United Nations, and indicated that he would not grant them access to intelligence documents they have demanded to see before allowing the confirmation to go ahead.</p> <p>Mr. Bush's statements, at a news conference in the Rose Garden, suggested that he was intent on winning the battle over Mr. Bolton on his own terms when the Senate reconvenes next week, rather than negotiating a deal with Democrats and some Republicans who have been advocating a compromise.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'crime and criminals', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A Russian court convicted Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the embattled tycoon and founder of the Yukos oil company, on criminal charges Tuesday and sentenced him to nine years in prison, bringing to an end the most closely watched trial in Russia since the Soviet Union collapsed.</p> <p>The verdict and the sentence carried the feel of conclusions long ago foregone. The Kremlin has portrayed the oil magnate and his company as self-interested tax cheats with little respect for either the law or the state.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>The Bush administration appeared to show signs of new flexibility in talks with North Korea on Tuesday, with American and North Korean diplomats meeting here at length to discuss the delicate question of how aid or energy assistance may be provided to the North as it begins the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>Delegations from the two countries met alone here for the second straight day to discuss a proposal the administration put forward in June 2004 before North Korea walked away from talks. Christopher R. Hill, who is leading the American delegation, told reporters that the ''businesslike'' meeting again raised the prospect of a three-month ''freeze'' period on North Korea's nuclear activity, followed by a rapid dismantlement of their nuclear plants. In return, the aid spigot from South Korea and other neighbors would begin to open wider.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld arrived in this Central Asian nation on Monday to shore up an unsettled military basing arrangement that has been critical to operations in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The refueling and cargo mission operated by the American military from Manas Air Base, just outside Bishkek, the capital, has been an essential link in the supply chain for moving aid to civilians, troops and equipment into and out of Afghanistan. About 1,000 American troops operate from the airfield, which is the base for nine KC-135 refueling jets and C-130 cargo planes.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Negotiators from the United States and North Korea held a rare, private meeting on Monday, underscoring the heightened stakes and grave concerns surrounding the six-nation talks on the North Korean nuclear crisis that opened here on Tuesday.</p> <p>The United States envoy, Christopher R. Hill, played down his 75-minute afternoon meeting with the North Koreans, and American officials in Beijing provided few details of the meeting. But in Washington, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, described the meeting as ''businesslike'' and said that ''they were able to compare notes about how the talks might move forward.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>North Korea on Wednesday criticized an American plan to defuse the nuclear crisis, saying the proposal demands too many steps toward dismantling the country's nuclear program before providing any corresponding aid or energy assistance, a senior United States official said in a background meeting with reporters.</p> <p>North Korea's criticism of the American plan, first proposed in June 2004 before the talks broke off, was not unexpected, noted the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the discussions. But it underscored the ''fundamental differences'' between the countries as participants in the six-nation nuclear talks took on the difficult task of finding common ground to resolve the crisis, now in its third year.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Iran on Tuesday rejected calls by European leaders to halt its renewed nuclear activities, but indicated a willingness to continue negotiations over its program, perhaps by offering a proposal of its own.</p> <p>''There is no reason to suspend this activity,'' Sirus Naser, Iran's chief delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters after an emergency meeting here of the agency's governing board on the matter.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>An American Congressional delegation was delayed at a provincial airport in Russia on Sunday as its members tried to leave the country, in an unexplained breach of protocol.</p> <p>The delegation's aircraft departed only after entreaties from the State Department resolved a dispute over the group's travels, said Courtney Austrian, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Negotiators meeting Monday for the seventh consecutive day about the North Korean nuclear program reported no progress as the six participating nations struggled to draft a joint statement of principles that would push the disarmament process forward.</p> <p>Christopher R. Hill, the lead American negotiator, arrived at his hotel late Monday after a day in which his delegation held private talks with the North Koreans and representatives of the other four nations.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>China and Russia will hold their most ambitious joint military exercises beginning Thursday, with naval ships, bombers, fighter planes and 10,000 troops massing on China's northeast coast for maneuvers that the two countries say will show their deepening cooperation.</p> <p>They say the exercise is not intended to threaten other countries, but to improve the ability of China and Russia to thwart terrorism and separatist uprisings on their borders. But the focus of those concerns is in Central Asia, while the exercises will be on the Pacific coast, 3,000 miles away. Energy and regional tensions exist in northeast Asia, however, and the display of mutual political trust between China and Russia may be more important than the military training involved, specialists in Russian and Chinese relations said.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'frauds and swindling', 'taxation', 'elections']	<p>Prison has done little to silence Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former oil tycoon who received a nine-year sentence three months ago. He has published jailhouse treatises, granted interviews and issued regular statements through his lawyers. Now he plans to run for Parliament.</p> <p>Seizing on a legal loophole, Mr. Khodorkovsky, Russia's most famous prisoner, on Wednesday announced an improbable effort to win elected office in a special parliamentary election in December. Despite his conviction on charges of fraud and tax evasion, a verdict that some here believe was orchestrated by President Vladimir V. Putin's government, officials acknowledged that technically he had the right to run.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism']	<p>The special police unit arrived in the darkness, carrying submachine guns and taking positions around an unmarked cargo truck parked beside a nuclear reactor. The doors to the reactor swung open and a forklift hurried three large steel casks onto the truck.</p> <p>Each container held several fuel rods of highly enriched uranium, potent enough for use in a nuclear bomb.</p>
['foreign aid', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>North Korea agreed Monday to end its nuclear weapons program in return for security, economic and energy benefits, potentially easing tensions with the United States after a two-year standoff over the North's efforts to build atomic bombs.</p> <p>The United States, North Korea and four other nations participating in negotiations in Beijing signed a draft accord in which the North promised to abandon efforts to produce nuclear weapons and re-admit international inspectors to its nuclear facilities.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Security Council diplomats worked out final details on Sunday on a tough resolution against Syria, an action that will forcefully step up international pressure on the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, and deepen his government's struggle to ward off increasing isolation.</p> <p>Diplomats from the resolution's three co-sponsors, Britain, France and the United States, said they expected passage on Monday and did not foresee a veto from either China or Russia, the two countries most reluctant to punish Syria.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>An independent report on the United Nations' $64 billion oil-for-food program for Iraq shed light Thursday on a circle of political aides and fixers in Russia and France who the report said made company connections, paid kickbacks and reaped benefits through contracts granted by the government of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>The report by a committee led by Paul A. Volcker, named major multinational companies as well as individuals who were involved.The committee reported that the Iraqi government developed a policy of favoring France, as well as Russia; it considered France a ''friend'' for opposing the United Nations' sanctions against Iraq. Other companies from different countries tried to reposition themselves with French connections and the help of well-placed people.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Ten men gathered in a dim three-room apartment one recent evening to plan the unseating of this country's autocratic president, Aleksandr G.

['economic conditions and trends', 'currency', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A few years ago, Russia's finance officials could only dream of the problem Aleksei L.

['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'finances', 'international trade and world market', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The Security Council voted unanimously on Monday to compel Syria to stop obstructing a United Nations investigation into the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri or face unspecified ''further action.''</p> <p>The 15-to-0 vote was a diplomatic shunning of Syria, which has found itself increasingly isolated since the publication 10 days ago of an initial report by the chief United Nations investigator in the case that identified high-ranking Syrian officials as suspects in the assassination. Among the votes was that of Algeria, the Arab representative on the Council.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>The United States and Europe will not seek a referral this week of their case against Iran to the United Nations Security Council, American and European diplomats said Tuesday. Instead, the diplomats said, they will allow more time for China, Russia, India and other countries to persuade Iran to stop its nuclear activities.</p> <p>The diplomats said they were convinced that Iran was becoming more isolated from other countries as a result of recent statements and actions, including threats to kick out inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and to resume enrichment of uranium.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Presenting a united front against Iran, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Friday that they would press Iran to reverse itself and accept a compromise allowing it to enrich uranium, but only in Russia and under strict controls.</p> <p>The plan would let Iran enrich uranium only to levels suitable for use in nuclear reactors, using Russian technology. ''We hope that over time Iran will see the virtue of this approach, and it may provide a way out,'' Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, told reporters here on Friday, after the two leaders met.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The Bush administration and three European allies have approved a new offer to be made to Iran in a last-ditch effort to head off a confrontation over its suspected nuclear weapons program.</p> <p>The proposal would permit Iran to conduct very limited nuclear activities on its own soil, but would move the process of enriching all of its uranium to Russia, American and European officials said.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Japan won a promise on Monday from President Vladimir V. Putin to establish within a year a construction timetable for a pipeline that would carry Siberian oil to the Sea of Japan.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's visit here, his first to Japan in five years, is seen as an attempt to balance Asia's power triangle, left lopsided by flourishing ties between Russia and China.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The leading countries of Europe conferred about Iran on Monday, with growing indications that they would not move later this week to refer Iran's recent actions in its nuclear program to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions.</p> <p>Western diplomats said it remained important to keep a consensus on Iran, not only between Europe and the United States but also with China, Russia and India, all of which have said they oppose a referral to the Security Council at this time.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'religion and churches', 'terrorism']	<p>Security officials here in Karachayevo-Cherkessia, a restive republic on Russia's mountainous southern border, have a secret list of people who are kept under scrutiny.</p> <p>Those on it have committed no crimes, but are considered suspect because they are Muslims who practice Islam outside of the state's sanctioned mosques.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'law and legislation', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>TODAY the Supreme Court justices are expected to debate whether they will hear a case involving a Yemeni named Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who is accused of being Osama bin Laden's driver. A federal appeals court found that Mr. Hamdan, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and is being held at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, was not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions; he has appealed to the high court.</p> <p>If the court does not choose to review the appellate court's decision, and then overturn it, America's national security will be endangered. I say that based on my experience as the senior American intelligence officer during the final three years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1986 to 1989). And I also feel that our intelligence agencies and military commanders should make clear to the Bush administration that our country's most fundamental commitments of humanitarian treatment have long been extended to the Afghan battlefield.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday defended Russia's right to scrutinize any political activity by foreign and domestic charities and nongovernmental organizations, even as he promised that ''civil society in Russia should not suffer.''</p> <p>Making his first public remarks on an issue that has caused a furor at home and abroad, Mr. Putin said he would consult with parliamentary leaders on new legislation that would place all private organizations under strict state control and threaten others with being closed down.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'law and legislation']	<p>WHEN we visited Moscow earlier this fall, almost everyone we talked to agreed that Russia is becoming steadily less democratic. Yet Russia's society and economy are in many ways freer than ever. Our visit convinced us of the vitality and potential of Russian civic groups and nongovernmental organizations, much like the ones Western Europeans and Americans know in their own countries. Unfortunately this sector -- human rights monitors, environmental groups, policy research institutions, even public health advocates -- is now at risk.</p> <p>The latest challenge to civil society comes from legislation introduced by members of President Vladimir Putin's party and other factions in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. This legislation would, among other things, keep foreign nonprofit organizations from having offices in Russia and deny foreign funds to Russian organizations that are suspected of engaging in undefined ''political'' activities. Even the limited grants permitted under the new law would be taxed as though they were corporate profits, at rates exceeding 40 percent. Virtually all nonprofit groups would be affected.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'elections']	<p>Early this year, as President Bush began his new term, he declared a vision with allure for many people living within the stunted democracies or autocratic governments in the former Soviet Union. ''The policy of the United States,'' Mr. Bush said, ''is to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.''</p> <p>Eleven months on, Mr. Bush's inaugural challenge is facing an oblique but determined attack in territory once under Moscow's sway. The battlegrounds are elections, which offer a glimpse into an emerging nation's political health. At issue are perceptions. What exactly is democratic progress? And who gets to define it?</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights', 'crime and criminals', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>First, more than 1,000 nationalists marched openly down Moscow's central thoroughfare on Nov. 4, some handing out racist fliers. Then, about three weeks later, the police broke up a counterprotest on the same street and detained some of the organizers of what was called an ''anti-fascist'' response to the original rally.</p> <p>On Sunday, the latest in the series of dueling rallies over growing anti-immigrant sentiment in Moscow this fall looped through several backstreets in the Russian capital.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'law and legislation']	<p>Russia's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday amended legislation intended to increase the government's control over charities and other private organizations, but left in place core provisions that critics said would open the groups to political pressure or even force them to close.</p> <p>The legislation advanced despite international pressure that included a resolution of the United States Congress and appeals from leading Bush administration officials that the law, if adopted, would stifle free debate and undercut efforts to promote democracy and political pluralism in Russia.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Bruce Morrow worked for three years on the shores of Lake Samotlor, a tiny dot of water in a maze of oil wells and roads covering more than a thousand square miles of icy tundra in Siberia.</p> <p>From the maps the Russians gave Mr. Morrow, he could never really know where he was, a misery for him as an oil engineer at a joint venture between BP and Russian investors. The latitude and longitude had been blotted out from his maps and the grid diverged from true north.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'elections', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Last winter, the Kremlin-backed candidate in Ukraine's contested presidential election lost to Viktor A. Yushchenko, the pro-Western leader of the Orange Revolution.</p> <p>This winter, Russia is demanding almost a fivefold increase in the price of gas supplied to Ukraine, a change widely seen as payback for Moscow's embarrassment a year ago.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'law and legislation']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized Russia on Wednesday, saying she had serious concerns about a proposed law that could shut down private groups, including some financed by the United States, that promote democracy, human rights and related issues.</p> <p>She made her remarks during a news conference here with President Viktor A. Yushchenko, who came to power in Ukraine a year ago after a popular uprising. Many leaders of that uprising received instruction and advice from the very groups that Russia is proposing to ban or seriously restrict.</p>
['elections']	<p>The party of President Vladimir V. Putin took a strong lead on Sunday in city council elections here in what was widely seen as a dress rehearsal for federal elections in 2007 and the election for a successor to Mr. Putin in 2008.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's party, United Russia, had 46 percent of the vote with about 23 percent of it counted. The Communist Party had 17 percent, and a liberal bloc running under the name Yabloko had nearly 11 percent. Throughout the campaign, all of the opposition parties complained about United Russia, the dominant party.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>Faced with mounting criticism from its natural gas customers across Western Europe, Russia on Monday restored most of the gas it withheld from Ukraine's pipeline system a day earlier in a pricing dispute.</p> <p>Officials of the state-owned Russian company, Gazprom, presented the decision not as a reversal but as a response to Ukraine's ''theft'' of natural gas. But it became clear almost immediately that the driving force in Russia's decision was the sharp criticism across Europe, including countries like Germany that are usually reliable allies.</p>
['atomic energy']	<p>The United States and Europe, seeking Russia's help in bringing Iran's nuclear activities before the United Nations Security Council for review, have assured Russian officials that they are not pressing for sanctions against Iran right now, American and European diplomats said Wednesday.</p> <p>The diplomats said that instead they were pursuing a limited effort to convene a Security Council debate and send the matter back to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitor, for further efforts to get Iran to suspend uranium activities that the West suspects are part of a nuclear weapons program.</p>
['currency', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism']	<p>It has all the makings of a James Bond movie: an isolated authoritarian regime running a secret counterfeiting network with tentacles reaching into foreign banks, the Irish Republican Army and Chinese underworld gangs dealing in narcotics and antiaircraft missiles.</p> <p>This is the picture of North Korea that former American officials and analysts say Washington has pieced together in recent years as it has investigated the appearance around the world of bogus $100 bills so perfect that they have been called ''supernotes.''</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>After a year of increasingly troubled relations with Russia, American and European diplomats said Wednesday that President Vladimir V. Putin's decision to withhold natural gas from Ukraine's pipelines had further undercut the West's faith in his government's reliability and raised doubts about his ability to lead the Group of 8 industrial nations this year.</p> <p>The diplomats also said the settlement of the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over natural gas prices was a step forward, but said at least some of its elements were worrisome, particularly that it named a Russian company of uncertain ownership as an intermediary in the selling of natural gas to Ukraine.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'elections']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin told Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on Saturday to continue selling subsidized gas to Ukraine until the end of March if Ukraine agrees to pay market prices beginning in April.</p> <p>Mr. Putin's order, delivered on national television as Gazprom threatened to cut off gas exports for Ukraine beginning on Jan. 1, put Russia's president in the center of a dispute that has caused Europe to worry whether its gas supply will be disrupted in the January chill.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Iran announced Monday that it had postponed talks on letting Russia enrich its uranium, a proposal that Russia had offered as a way to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p> <p>Iran also signaled that it was resuming the enrichment of uranium at one of its main nuclear sites, according to diplomats close to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>General Motors, which in the United States struggles with ballooning pension and benefits payments, among other things, has more basic troubles in Russia -- the company was without engines for 11 days this month.</p> <p>G.M. said Monday that it had settled a dispute with a Russian business partner over the price of engines and other parts, and that production would resume Tuesday.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>A Russian effort to forge a compromise over Iran's nuclear program stalled Monday after five hours of talks in the Kremlin ended inconclusively. Negotiators for both countries agreed to hold new talks but did not announce when or where.</p> <p>The discussions, already delayed several days, focused on the details of Russia's offer to set up a joint venture to enrich uranium in Russia for Iran's nuclear fuel.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'terrorism', 'elections']	<p>A new Palestinian parliament dominated by the militant group Hamas was installed here Saturday, and immediately President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas lawmakers set out on a collision course over the need to honor existing agreements with Israel and conduct negotiations with it to achieve Palestinian statehood.</p> <p>In a speech to new lawmakers at his headquarters in Ramallah, Mr. Abbas congratulated Hamas on its victory but warned the legislature that it could not disavow agreements and commitments by the Palestinian leadership dating back to the late 1980's. Those include United Nations resolutions and the 1993 Oslo accords, ratified by the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization, that commit the Palestinians to a peace solution based on an independent state side by side with Israel.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media']	<p>A Russian court ruled Friday that the director of a small American-financed human rights organization had incited ethnic and religious hatred by publishing newspaper commentaries by two Chechen separatist leaders in 2004.</p> <p>The court, however, imposed only a two-year suspended sentence, allowing him to go free, rather than sentencing him to four years in prison, as prosecutors had demanded.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>RUSSIA today is not the same country it was only six years ago, when Vladimir Putin became president. Back then, the country was unsettled, tumultuous and impoverished, but it was free. Today Russia is richer -- and not free.</p> <p>A new model of Russia has taken shape. The state has become, essentially, a corporate enterprise that the nominal owners, Russian citizens, no longer control. Indeed, changes in legislation and limitations on political freedoms have effectively devalued the shares in this company -- call it Russian State -- that ordinary Russians hold, while an elite class of investors enjoys ever increasing privileges.</p>
['religion and churches', 'suits and litigation']	<p>A court in Moscow this week dismissed a civil lawsuit brought against an exhibition that a group of artists said had violated their religious freedoms by mocking Russian Orthodoxy and inciting interfaith animosity. The nine artists who filed the suit sought the equivalent of $170,000 for ''moral injury'' caused by the exhibition, ''Russia 2.'' The show ran at the same time as Moscow's first biennial of contemporary art last year and included works by some of Russia's most prominent artists, among them Gor Chahal, Marina Koldobskaya and the comic pair the Blue Nose (Vyacheslav Mizin and Aleksandr Shaburov). The judge cited the constitution's provisions separating church and state, the newspaper Kommersant reported on Thursday. ''It is the first victory for art,'' Marat Guelman, one of the show's organizers, said in a phone interview, noting the criminal conviction last year of the director and a curator at the Andrei Sakharov Museum in Moscow on a similar charge arising from a 2003 exhibition that many saw as ridiculing the Orthodox Church.</p> <p>STEVEN LEE MYERS</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday defended Russia's handling of natural gas disputes with Ukraine and Georgia, boasted of a new strategic weapon and defended the country's contribution to the Group of 8 in response to suggestions from some critics at home and abroad that his policies have disqualified it from the club of elite democratic nations.</p> <p>''Everybody wants Russia to join the club and take an active part in its work because nobody wants the G-8 to turn into a gathering of fat cats,'' Mr. Putin said. He argued that Russia, comparatively poor though making economic gains, understood ''the problem facing developing countries better than anyone else in the G-8.''</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>Moral declarations may be good for the soul, even for diplomats, but they do not always provide a policy.</p> <p>The United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- the so-called quartet on the Middle East -- have lined up in solidarity with Israel in calling on Hamas, which won the Palestinian legislative elections, to modify its radical policies. No direct aid to a Hamas-led government, they say.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Four weeks after Ukraine cut a deal to import natural gas through RosUkrEnergo, a shell entity based in Switzerland, the obscure company is facing an uncomfortable amount of attention.</p> <p>After becoming one of Europe's biggest energy traders overnight with the Ukraine deal, the company promised changes to become more open about its operations. Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, owns half of the company; its other owners have not been disclosed. The plush terms the company has received in the past from Gazprom are also a matter of much speculation.</p>
['foreign aid', 'finances']	<p>The Israeli cabinet decided Sunday to immediately freeze the transfer of about $50 million a month in tax and customs receipts due to the Palestinian Authority, arguing that the swearing in of a Hamas-dominated legislature on Saturday meant that the Palestinians were now led by the militant group.</p> <p>''It is clear that in the light of the Hamas majority in the parliament and the instructions to form a new government that were given to the head of Hamas, the Palestinian Authority is in practice becoming a terrorist authority,'' Ehud Olmert, the acting prime minister, told his cabinet. ''The state of Israel will not agree to this.''</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'books and literature']	<p>Boris A. Berezovsky, a self-exiled Russian tycoon, said Friday that he would sell his remaining business interests to a partner, to free them from what he called unrelenting political pressure from the Kremlin.</p> <p>Mr. Berezovsky, at one time Russia's richest man, is wanted by Russian authorities, who accuse him of fraud and other offenses. He has been living in Britain, where he was granted political asylum. Mr. Berezovsky said his partner, Badri Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian citizen who is also wanted in Russia, would buy him out, though Mr. Berezovsky did not say for how much.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>A senior Iranian official pledged on Wednesday to provide financial support to a Hamas-controlled Palestinian Authority, which is already in budget trouble and facing more aid cuts.</p> <p>''We will definitely help this government financially in order to resist America's cruelty,'' said Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, referring to the Palestinian Authority. He spoke in Tehran after meeting with the senior Hamas leader, Khaled Meshal, but provided no details or figures about what kind or level of support oil-affluent Iran would give.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections']	<p>France on Friday endorsed Russia's decision to hold talks on the Middle East conflict with Hamas, the radical Islamist Palestinian group, saying the discussion ''can contribute to advancing our positions.''</p> <p>Other European countries distanced themselves from the French statement, which appeared to be in defiance of the American and European view that Hamas is a terrorist organization and therefore should not be officially recognized. Israel condemned it. But the United States took a more cautious approach.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Finance ministers from the Group of 8 industrialized nations arrived Friday on a frosty, sunny day for a weekend meeting that is sure to revive doubts on Russia's membership in the club.</p> <p>For the first time, Russia, which holds the chairmanship this year, will be the host of the meeting of the G-8, whose other members are Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan.</p>
['foreign aid']	<p>The European Union is considering making direct payments to the moderate Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, as a way of supporting him while trying to maintain financial pressure on Hamas, the antiIsraeli militant group that swept to power in elections last month.</p> <p>The idea was raised this week by the European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, after a conference call with other members of the so-called Quartet -- the United States, Russia and the United Nations -- that has been promoting peace efforts between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>WITH the Iranian nuclear crisis about to land in the Security Council, the events that led up to the war in Iraq point clearly to what needs to be done.</p> <p>In the decade preceding the Iraq war, Mr. Hussein was able to defy the major powers when they were divided. Exploiting his advantage as a single actor and Washington's indecision over whether it most wanted nonproliferation or regime change, Mr. Hussein consistently outmaneuvered his diplomatic opponents.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Bush administration and Russia, struggling to forge a joint strategy on Iran, remain at odds over whether the United Nations Security Council should take a step toward imposing penalties on Iran by labeling its nuclear activities a threat to world peace, American and European officials say.</p> <p>The officials say that the Russian-American impasse, in which leading European countries are siding with the Bush administration, has held up what the West had hoped would be a unanimous move by the Security Council on Iran this month. The impasse also has echoes of the Iraq war, they say, in that Russia is concerned about a possible replay of the United States' using resolutions by the Council to confront Iran in the same way it acted against Iraq.</p>
['espionage', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Captured Iraqi documents describe a Russian spy operation that was aimed at the United States Central Command in the early days of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to a new American military report. The report says information on war plans and troop movements was passed through the Russian ambassador in Baghdad.</p> <p>Revelation of the operation, contained in the public version of a Joint Forces Command classified study, the Iraqi Perspectives Project, may have more political than military significance because American forces overwhelmed the underequipped and poorly led Iraqi Army to oust Saddam Hussein.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and Europe said Friday that they would impose sanctions against President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus and other top officials for cracking down on a peaceful protest over his re-election, which was widely seen as a sham.</p> <p>The swift and nearly unanimous condemnations from Western nations widened their rift with Belarus and posed new challenges for their relations with Russia, which has stood behind Mr. Lukashenko.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Sunday that the United States would seek clarification from Russia of an American military report that it had helped pass information to Iraq before the 2003 invasion, but she declined to make any specific allegations about Russian involvement.</p> <p>''I don't have any reason to doubt or confirm the report at this point,'' Ms. Rice said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''I do think we have to look at the documents and look very carefully.''</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Ramzan Kadyrov, the outspoken leader of a violent paramilitary force that controls much of Chechnya, continued his political rise on Saturday when he was appointed the republic's prime minister.</p> <p>Mr. Kadyrov, 29, is the son of Akhmad Kadyrov, a former Chechen president and separatist turned Kremlin loyalist who was assassinated in 2004. The father had allowed the son to lead several thousand former rebels in a notorious unit called the Presidential Security Service, which gave him a firm base of power.</p>
['suits and litigation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A Moscow court appointed a bankruptcy administrator on Tuesday for Yukos, once Russia's largest private oil company, pushing it closer to insolvency and the probable nationalization of its remaining assets.</p> <p>The action was taken on the first day of a bankruptcy hearing by the Moscow Arbitration Court, which also set a June 27 hearing to decide whether Yukos should be declared bankrupt.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>European and American diplomats circulated a new draft statement to the Security Council on Tuesday evening that weakens language condemning Iran's nuclear program but still calls on Tehran to abandon uranium enrichment activities, which the West believes are intended to make weapons.</p> <p>The new draft, written by Britain and France and supported by the United States, eliminates or softens elements in earlier drafts that had raised objections from China and Russia.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Vice President Dick Cheney declared Tuesday that the United Nations Security Council would ''impose meaningful consequences'' on Iran if it proceeded with uranium enrichment activities, and the Bush administration put an end to talk of compromise with Iran as floated by Russia.</p> <p>But the administration's tough language pressing the Tehran government to return to a suspension of its enrichment program left unclear what the Security Council would do when it takes up Iran's case next week. The administration's goal is to win consent for a statement by the Security Council president calling on Iran to cooperate with the demand for a freeze on its nuclear activities.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Iran and the United States have begun to reveal new strategies in their nuclear dispute that seem bound to escalate their confrontation, as both nations seek to turn to their advantage a highly critical report that portrays a nuclear program proceeding at full tilt, in growing secrecy.</p> <p>In many ways, what has unfolded in the past three days resembles cold-war deception and brinkmanship, with some decidedly new twists for a very different nuclear age. As in the early days of the cold war, both sides have tried to write the rules on the fly, using every tool available -- from American threats of sanctions to Iranian threats to cut off oil.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The top envoys in the six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear arms program gathered here on Monday for an academic conference on international security, but prospects that the long-stalled negotiations would resume appeared low.</p> <p>Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said upon his arrival here that he had no plans to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan. ''I am not planning to request a bilateral meeting,'' Mr. Hill told reporters, ''and to my knowledge they have not requested it either.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush said Monday that he remained committed to using diplomacy to block Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, his first public comments addressing recent speculation that the United States was weighing military action to do so.</p> <p>The president, taking questions from an audience at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, dismissed reports published over the weekend that described military planning for attacks against Iran, saying they contained ''wild speculation.'' Reports in The Washington Post and The New Yorker magazine, outlining military plans, said the United States had not ruled out using nuclear weapons against underground nuclear sites in Iran.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'elections', 'ethics']	<p>Next week, after years of waiting for an unequivocal nod of Western approval, President Ilham H. Aliyev of Azerbaijan will fly to Washington to be received at the White House, a visit his administration hopes will lift his stature.</p> <p>Being a guest of President Bush has been billed in Mr. Aliyev's circle as a chance for the 44-year-old president -- dogged by allegations of corruption, election rigging and repression of opposition figures -- to gain more international legitimacy.</p>
['taxation', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The wines and spirits section of the Azbuka Vkusa supermarket, one of Moscow's largest, has an utterly new look.</p> <p>Until last week there was a robust selection of wines from Georgia and Moldova, long the most popular in the former Soviet world. Now, on shelves once crowded with dry Tsinandalis and sweet muscats, stand hastily relocated wines from Italy, Bulgaria, Ukraine and France.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Bush administration called Friday for Russia and Europe to penalize Iran over its suspected nuclear arms program if no agreement on sanctions can be reached soon at the United Nations Security Council.</p> <p>Seeking to press Iran at a time when prospects for Security Council action appear doubtful, R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, said individual countries should work together ''for the purpose of isolating the Iranians diplomatically and economically'' if the Council cannot act in a ''reasonable'' time period.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Dry young Saperavi, a wine so tannic that Georgian winemakers often call it not red but black, can be one of the great pleasures of the former Soviet world.</p> <p>It is a wine with origins reaching back thousands of years, and whose rich and varied flavors have been newly coaxed by a generation of post-Soviet winemakers who are reviving the Caucasus' ancient culture of grapes and wines.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>A one-day trip to Iran by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, ended Thursday night with no agreement by the Iranians to halt their production of enriched uranium. And European diplomats said Iran had shown inspectors evidence that they were preparing to double the size of their small-scale production facilities within weeks.</p> <p>Before Dr. ElBaradei's arrival, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran issued a taunt meant to erase any doubts about whether Iran was determined to plunge ahead with its fuel-making facilities in defiance of a warning from the United Nations.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The Bush administration, seeking to enlist Russian support for a United Nations Security Council resolution on Iran, has agreed to language ruling out the immediate threat of military force, American and European officials said Tuesday.</p> <p>The American agreement has improved the chances that the Russians will go along with the resolution, European diplomats said.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>It did not take long for the European Union's border experts to spot evidence of the shadowy trade on Ukraine's notoriously porous border with Moldova. It came in an unexpected form, though: Tyson frozen chicken.</p> <p>''Every time, leg quarters,'' Torsten Spehr, a German border officer, said at this border crossing with Moldova's self-declared separatist region, Transnistria.</p>
['treaties', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>The Bush administration is moving to establish a new antimissile site in Europe that would be designed to stop attacks by Iran against the United States and its European allies.</p> <p>The administration's proposal, which comes amid rising concerns about Iran's suspected program to develop nuclear weapons, calls for installing 10 antimissile interceptors at a European site by 2011. Poland and the Czech Republic are among the nations under consideration.</p>
['terrorism', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>Even at night the fresh sounds rise above one of the most ruined cities on earth. They are the thumps of hammers and mallets, and the rumbles of diesel engines. Lights glow inside the shells of broken buildings, where masons are at work.</p> <p>For years spring has reliably meant renewed fighting here in the capital of Chechnya. But after more than a decade of war, banditry and stubborn disorder, a noticeably different spring campaign has gained momentum with the Caucasus thaw.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'ethics']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin fired the head of the customs service and a dozen or so midlevel security agency officials on Friday, ostensibly part of an anticorruption sweep of the Russian bureaucracy but moves that also undermined a pro-Western member of his cabinet.</p> <p>Officials caught up in the mini-purge were accused of smuggling cars, wine and even yachts to Russia, or skimming the billions of dollars in duties collected in Russia's import-dependent economy.</p>
['civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'religion and churches', 'war and revolution']	<p>Three circles of barefoot men, one ring inside another, sway to the cadence of chant.</p> <p>The men stamp in time as they sway, and grunt from the abdomen and throat, filling the room with a primal sound. One voice rises over the rest, singing variants of the names of God.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>To many Americans, oil companies like Exxon Mobil or Chevron appear all powerful, pocketing record profits as energy costs soar. But in many countries around the world, high oil prices are also making life considerably harder for big oil companies.</p> <p>Sharply higher energy prices have shifted the power to oil-producing countries, as some governments seek a larger share of the riches. As a result, even as Western oil companies expand their reach through acquisitions and multibillion-dollar projects, a resurgence of nationalist policies is weakening their influence.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>A day after chastising Moscow for its use of oil and natural gas as ''tools for intimidation and blackmail,'' Vice President Dick Cheney visited Kazakhstan on Friday to promote export routes that bypass Russia and directly supply the West.</p> <p>With his comments, Mr. Cheney waded into a messy geopolitical struggle for energy and influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union, rapidly becoming one of the world's largest-producing regions.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and Europe are divided over the latest phase of their negotiating strategy on Iran, with the Bush administration resisting a new European offer that includes a proposal for a Middle East security ''framework'' for Iran if it gives up its nuclear activities, diplomats from each side said Friday.</p> <p>The diplomats said the administration was also resisting the idea of protecting European companies from punishment by the United States for violating its sanctions if they did business with Iran, as called for in the European proposal.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Bush administration officials said on Wednesday that the package of incentives offered to Iran could theoretically allow it to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes someday, but expressed severe doubts that Iran could satisfy the conditions that would allow it to do so.</p> <p>The decision to leave that possibility open amounts to a significant shift in United States policy, because President Bush has repeatedly said that he would not allow Iran to produce nuclear fuel or to gain the knowledge necessary to build a weapon. He has insisted that all nuclear fuel for Iranian power production come from outside Iran.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's secret services to find and kill those who kidnapped and killed four Russian Embassy employees in Iraq, the Kremlin announced in a statement.</p> <p>The bluntness of the statement reflected the deep shock and anger -- much directed at the United States -- that have unfolded in Russia after the kidnapping on June 3 in an attack that killed a fifth Russian.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Iran's foreign minister said Saturday that the government would issue a counteroffer to an incentive proposal by Europe, China and the United States to persuade Iran to give up enriching uranium in the short term.</p> <p>The foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, confirmed that Iran had received the proposal and would offer its own. ''We hope that through shuttle diplomacy we can give our proposal in the form of amendment or package after it is finalized to the other side for examination,'' he said, according to the ISNA news agency.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'news and news media']	<p>YOU know you're a frequent flier when you wake up and don't remember where you are. You have to look at the hotel phone to figure it out. I've had to do that a time or two.</p> <p>But as a war correspondent, my first question in the morning isn't, ''where am I?'' It is: ''safe or not safe?''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>The Bush administration said Wednesday that the United States would join Europeans in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, but only if Tehran first suspended its uranium activities, which are thought to be a cover for developing nuclear arms.</p> <p>The declaration, by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, was a shift away from decades of refusal to hold broad, direct talks with Iran. But Iran has long said it would not agree to preconditions, and the administration's offer appeared to be aimed as much at placating American allies as at wooing Iran.</p>
['atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>After 27 years in which the United States has refused substantive talks with Iran, President Bush reversed course on Wednesday because it was made clear to him -- by his allies, by the Russians, by the Chinese, and eventually by some of his advisers -- that he no longer had a choice.</p> <p>During the past month, according to European officials and some current and former members of the Bush administration, it became obvious to Mr. Bush that he could not hope to hold together a fractious coalition of nations to enforce sanctions -- or consider military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites -- unless he first showed a willingness to engage Iran's leadership directly over its nuclear program and exhaust every nonmilitary option.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>AS the world watches the political maneuvering over restarting nuclear talks with Iran -- this time with American participation -- few are paying attention to a broader strategic competition that has started between the United States, Russia and China. Ultimately, this competition will decide not only the direction of Iran's nuclear activities but also its economic, political and military role in the Middle East and beyond. The outcome hinges on which countries will assume dominance in developing Iran's enormous oil and natural gas reserves.</p> <p>Unfortunately, by refusing to consider a ''grand bargain'' with Iran -- that is, resolution of Washington's concerns about Tehran's weapons of mass destruction and support for terrorism in return for American security guarantees, an end to sanctions and normalization of diplomatic relations -- the Bush administration is courting failure in its nuclear diplomacy and paving the way for Russia and China to win the larger strategic contest.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>The success or failure of the international initiative to curb Iran's nuclear program hinges largely on an ostensibly clear-cut request: before talks can begin, Tehran must freeze all activities related to the enrichment of uranium.</p> <p>But while that demand seems surgically precise, what it actually means is unclear. It has become the subject of anxious diplomacy around the world -- a sort of prenegotiation negotiation -- centered on finding a definition that the Iranians and the six countries behind the initiative can accept. The results will determine if the talks move ahead or fail before they formally start.</p>
['law and legislation']	<p>For wine drinkers here, things were bad enough when the authorities banned imports from Georgia and Moldova in the spring, but one could get by with other imports that were -- no offense -- better. Things are about to get worse.</p> <p>In the last few days, wines from France, Italy, the United States and everywhere else have started disappearing from shops, supermarkets and restaurants. So have the whiskeys of Scotland and Ireland, the gins of England, the tequilas of Mexico. The reason is neither panic buying (though that would be in order) nor an unexpected appearance of Russian teetotalism, but rather a new federal excise law that has bottles flying off the shelves in a way no one intended.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Two pro-Kremlin officials were assassinated minutes apart on Friday in Ingushetia, a republic bordering Chechnya in Russia's volatile North Caucasus.</p>
['elections', 'ethics']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin has dismissed Russia's chief prosecutor, who only a week ago promised to disclose new ''high-profile criminal cases'' involving government corruption, officials said Friday.</p> <p>The dismissal, ordered on Thursday and approved by legislators on Friday, was unexpected and, as is typical for the Kremlin, largely unexplained. It prompted a flurry of speculation about Mr. Putin's motives.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday defied pressure from foreign leaders to accept a package of incentives in return for ending all nuclear activities, saying Iran will pursue its legal right to develop a peaceful nuclear program.</p> <p>''Any pressure to deprive our people from their right will not bear any fruit,'' he was quoted as saying on state-run television.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>On a Tuesday afternoon two months ago, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down to a small lunch in President Bush's private dining room behind the Oval Office and delivered grim news to her boss: Their coalition against Iran was at risk of falling apart.</p> <p>A meeting she had attended in Berlin days earlier with European foreign ministers had been a disaster, she reported, according to participants in the discussion. Iran was neatly exploiting divisions among the Europeans and Russia, and speeding ahead with its enrichment of uranium. The president grimaced, one aide recalled, interpreting the look as one of exasperation ''that said, 'O.K., team, what's the answer?' ''</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a gathering of defense experts here on Saturday that Iran was ''one of the leading terrorist nations in the world.''</p> <p>Mr. Rumsfeld also questioned why Russia and China would allow Iran to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional organization that includes Russia, China and Central Asian nations.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Iran on Tuesday welcomed an array of international incentives aimed at persuading the country to freeze crucial nuclear activities, but stressed that there were issues that needed to be resolved before any agreement could be reached.</p> <p>''We had constructive talks,'' Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, told state television after meeting with Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief. ''The proposals contain positive steps and also some ambiguities which should be removed.''</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Deep beneath the thick forests of Siberia, near Lake Baikal, lies a vast deposit of natural gas known as Kovykta, a field so large it could supply all the United States' needs for three years.</p> <p>But Russia has so far refused to allow the private companies developing the field to build a pipeline to export the gas. Instead, the only customer is a tiny neighboring logging town happy to replace its soot-belching, coal-fired power with gas.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia and China, crossing a diplomatic threshold in the effort to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, joined the United States and Europe on Wednesday by agreeing to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution ordering Iran to freeze some nuclear activities, or face sanctions.</p> <p>The movement toward a resolution represented increased anger over Iran's refusal to respond to an offer of economic and energy incentives if it suspended its uranium enrichment.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>As violence spreads in the Middle East, the Bush administration is grappling with an unwanted side effect of its policies: higher oil prices caused by fears of a disruption in global oil supplies.</p> <p>While the administration seeks to confront Iran, give Israel more time to defeat Hezbollah, and secure stability in Iraq, higher oil prices reduce its maneuvering room overseas and frustrate American consumers at home.</p>
['accidents and safety', 'atomic energy', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'energy and power']	<p>The Bush administration said Saturday that it would open formal negotiations with Russia on a long-discussed civilian nuclear agreement that would pave the way for Russia to become one of the world's largest repositories of spent nuclear fuel.</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin has been looking to expand the country's role in the multibillion nuclear power business. The United States has traditionally opposed any such arrangement, in part because of concerns about the safety of Russian nuclear facilities, and because the country has helped Iran build its first major nuclear reactor.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>WHEN observing the West's conciliatory dealings with Russia, I'm reminded of a quotation often attributed to Winston Churchill: ''However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.''</p> <p>For five years, President Bush has been talking about maintaining an open dialogue with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and about how hard he has worked to convince the Russian leader that ''it's in his interest to adopt Western-style values and universal values.'' This sounds reasonable, but we don't have to go on theory. There's a track record -- one that clearly shows that persuasion and appeasement toward Russia have failed.</p>
['foreign aid', 'crime and criminals', 'atomic energy', 'energy and power', 'ethics']	<p>A former Russian nuclear energy minister who is wanted in the United States on federal conspiracy and money laundering charges was released from prison on bail on Friday by Russia's Supreme Court.</p> <p>The former minister, Yevgeny O. Adamov, has been the subject of a long legal tug-of-war between Russia and the United States, which accused him of diverting about $9 million in American aid for nuclear security to shell companies and personal accounts.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>The Russian security officers, in plain clothes, arrived in the late afternoon at a hotel where a pro-democracy conference was being held, witnesses said.</p> <p>They swiftly seized four members of a political movement opposed to President Vladimir V. Putin, handcuffed them and rushed them away. Then they turned on a German magazine correspondent who tried to photograph the arrests. One of the officers snatched his camera and left with it, too.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The Bush administration has tried to ignore North Korea, then, reluctantly, to engage it, and then to squeeze its bankers in a manner intended to make the country's leader, Kim Jong Il, personally feel the pinch.</p> <p>Yet none of these steps in the past six years has worked. So now, after a barrage of missile launchings by North Korea, President Bush and his national security advisers found themselves on Wednesday facing what one close aide described as an array of ''familiar bad choices.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'espionage']	<p>The Bush administration tried Wednesday to build international support for stronger measures, including sanctions, to persuade North Korea to abandon its weapons program after it fired a seventh missile into the Sea of Japan. But China and Russia resisted, saying they favored less punitive actions.</p> <p>''I strongly believe that it is much more effective to have more than one nation dealing with North Korea,'' President Bush said a few hours after the North followed its six-missile barrage of the previous day with a seventh missile launching.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons']	<p>President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday will announce a new global program to track potential nuclear terrorists, detect and lock up bomb-making materials and coordinate their responses if terrorists obtain a weapon, according to administration officials who have negotiated the deal.</p> <p>Within months, the officials said, they expect China, Japan, the major European powers, Kazakhstan and Australia to form the initial group of nations under what the two leaders are calling ''The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.'' The informal organization of countries is based on the American-led ''Proliferation Security Initiative,'' a group of more than 70 countries that have pledged to help seize illicit weapons as they move across oceans or are transported by air. Some countries in that group now hold regular drills to share intelligence and practice seizures.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>SPEEDING through the ruins of Chechnya this spring, Ramzan Kadyrov, the unpredictable warlord turned Chechen prime minister, was asked about the hunt for Shamil Basayev, the separatist and terrorist leader who ordered the killing of Mr. Kadyrov's father.</p> <p>Not one for subtlety, the prime minister released the steering wheel, whooped and clapped his hands in front of his forehead, as if catching a fly. Then he mashed his palms together. ''Basayev,'' he said. ''My dream is to kill him.''</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>President Bush met with some of President Vladimir V. Putin's most persistent critics upon arriving here Friday, in a signal of concern to his uneasy ally about the tenuous state of Russian democracy.</p> <p>The meeting came just hours before the two and their wives dined together privately at the 1,000-room Konstantinovsky Palace in nearby Strelna, where Russia is to play host to the annual summit meeting of the world's largest economic powers starting Saturday.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The five permanent members of the Security Council reached agreement Friday on a resolution demanding that Iran suspend nuclear enrichment and reprocessing work by the end of August or face the possibility of sanctions.</p> <p>The resolution, which is expected to go to a vote in the 15-member Council next week, requests ''full and sustained suspension'' of nuclear activities by Aug. 31 and calls on all countries to prevent the shipment to Iran of any materials that could be used in its enrichment-related activities or ballistic missile programs.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>American-financed radio news broadcasts to Russia, a staple of the American government's outreach efforts since the cold war, have been sharply curtailed in recent months under legal pressure from the Russian government, according to Russian and American officials.</p> <p>The pressure has knocked programs off the air in much of the country, limiting the Russian-language news broadcasts of Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty almost entirely to Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'law and legislation']	<p>Were he still around, what would Peter the Great make of the Group of 8 summit meeting being held this weekend in his imperial capital? Would he find any kindred autocratic spirits among the leaders of the industrialized world as they confer in the grand palaces of St. Petersburg? For critics of George W. Bush and his expansive view of presidential power, the question answers itself, and Jacques Chirac certainly wins points for hauteur. But compared to other presidents making headlines lately (leaders chosen, more or less, by their own people) Bush and Chirac have been models of executive self-restraint.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments']	<p>President Viktor A. Yushchenko of Ukraine, the reformer who rode a wave of popular protests to power in the Orange Revolution but lost credibility this year when his party came in third in parliamentary elections, was forced to nominate his former rival as prime minister early Thursday.</p> <p>The appointment, which is likely to be approved by Parliament, sets up an unusual power-sharing government between the opponents in the scandal-tainted election of a year and a half ago.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Russia's defense minister said Friday that it was premature to consider punitive actions against Iran despite its refusal so far to suspend its efforts to enrich uranium as the United Nations Security Council has demanded.</p> <p>Although Russia agreed to the Security Council's resolution on July 31, Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov's remarks made it clear that Russia would not support taking the next step that the United States and Britain have called for: imposing sanctions against Iran or its leaders over its nuclear programs. The Council set Aug. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to its demand.</p>
['religion and churches', 'freedom and human rights', 'immigration and refugees']	<p>A series of recent incidents, including the killing last week of a popular religious leader by government security forces in this restive southern border town, has many here calling into question the pro-Western orientation of Kyrgyzstan.</p> <p>Expectations that the Central Asian nation would lead its neighbors toward a pro-Western -- and especially pro-American -- alignment crested after it ousted its president in March 2005. The so-called Tulip Revolution was part of a wave of ''colored revolutions'' that overthrew leaders aligned with Russia in Georgia and Ukraine and swept into power pro-Western administrations.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States, in its first formal reaction after Iran's counteroffer to an incentives proposal to quit its nuclear program, said Iran's position ''falls short'' of United Nations demands.</p> <p>A State Department statement said the United States was ''consulting closely'' with members of the United Nations Security Council over its next steps.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Despite suspicions that Iran is intimately involved in the current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Bush administration has carefully stopped short of accusing Iran of inciting the crisis.</p> <p>President Bush has said on several occasions that he believes Iran has armed and encouraged Hezbollah, a Shiite militia operating from southern Lebanon, and is fomenting terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere through proxies like Hezbollah. But he has shied away from words or actions that could spark an open confrontation with Iran.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States has imposed sanctions on seven foreign companies, two of them Russian, for providing Iran with materials that could be used to make unconventional weapons or cruise or ballistic missile systems, it was announced Friday.</p> <p>The sanctions, effective July 28, will be in place for two years. During that time, American government agencies are not allowed to buy goods or services from the seven companies or provide them with assistance. The sanctions also bar the sale of some military equipment, services or technologies to the companies or their subsidiaries.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'taxation', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>One judge slumped on her arm throughout a hearing in the multibillion-dollar business dispute, droopy eyes closing at times as lawyers spoke and an air-conditioner hummed.</p> <p>When it was over, she and two colleagues deliberated for less than half an hour before ordering that the Yukos oil company, once Russia's largest company, be declared bankrupt and its assets liquidated.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Iran responded Tuesday to a set of incentives from Europe and the United States aimed at ending its nuclear program, but did not agree to suspend the enrichment of uranium by the end of the month, the West's primary demand.</p> <p>In its response, Iran offered ''serious talks'' over its nuclear activities but did not raise the issue of suspending enrichment by Aug. 31, the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, Western diplomats said.</p>
['atomic energy', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'energy and power', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>It was always going to be tough for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to hold together her fragile coalition of world powers trying to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon has made that job harder.</p> <p>While Iran's official response to the package of carrots from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China was, at 21 pages, voluminous, the key point is that Iran's leaders did not agree to suspend enrichment of uranium, the central demand of the coalition.</p>
['atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'energy and power', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Just days before it is supposed to suspend enrichment of uranium or face the prospect of sanctions, Iran continues to project an image of defiance and confidence. Its position regarding the demand that it suspend enrichment remains a determined ''no.''</p> <p>On Saturday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a provocative, if symbolic, gesture by formally inaugurating a heavy-water reactor. The Iranians say the plant would be used for peaceful power generation. But nuclear experts note that heavy-water facilities are more useful for weapons because they produce lots of plutonium -- the preferred ingredient for missile warheads.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>The Boeing Company entered into a joint venture with a Russian supplier of titanium parts for its 787 Dreamliner airplane on Friday, though the supplier could fall under United States sanctions against companies that have exported military technology to Iran.</p> <p>Boeing has been dealing with the Russian company, VSMPO-Avisma, for nine years, and has turned to it as a major supplier for its popular new midsize airliner, the 787 Dreamliner.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in South Africa on Tuesday for a two-day state visit, the first for a Kremlin leader, that reunites two old ideological soulmates under a new banner: making money.</p> <p>Hours after landing in Cape Town and meeting with President Thabo Mbeki, Mr. Putin said at a news conference that Russia planned multibillion dollar investments in South Africa, signed a business cooperation agreement and announced a deal to extend sales of nuclear fuel and technology to South Africa's nascent nuclear power industry.</p>
['atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>As the Bush administration presses the world's other major powers to speed ahead with sanctions against Iran, a fascinating puzzle of conflicting evidence, contained in the latest findings by international inspectors, is fueling the debate on whether to confront Tehran over its nuclear activities.</p> <p>Ever since the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report last Thursday, American officials have insisted that it sealed their case. Iran, they argue, has refused the United Nations Security Council's demand that it cease enriching uranium.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'energy and power', 'finances']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia dismissed concerns over his country's growing interest in the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company at a meeting here Saturday with his French and German counterparts.</p> <p>''As far as the acquisition of a 5 percent stake is concerned, it is not at all evidence of aggressive behavior on the part of the Russian side,'' Mr. Putin told reporters after discussions with President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at Compiègne, north of Paris, that ranged from Russia's handling of its energy resources to such diplomatic issues as Lebanon and Iran. ''We will not use this stake to change in any way the institutional situation of EADS.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said Thursday that ''some important progress'' had been made in two days of talks over resolving Iran's nuclear ambitions and that more talks would be held next week.</p> <p>''We have had the opportunity of being together for several hours and of working with great intensity,'' Mr. Solana said after the talks with Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator. ''We have made some important progress on the elements related to how the potential negotiations can take place.''</p>
['energy and power', 'law and legislation', 'gas (fuel)', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Gazprom, the natural gas operator, has benefited handsomely from its position as the monopoly supplier of Russian natural gas to Europe. Now the Kremlin-backed energy company may get a similar role in Asia.</p> <p>This year Gazprom surpassed BP and Shell to become the second-largest energy company in the world by market capitalization, after Exxon Mobil. The value of its stock, traded in London and on Russian exchanges, doubled in 2005.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'energy and power']	<p>What a difference a few weeks can make. As OPEC ministers prepare to meet here Monday, the question on their minds is not how high oil prices will rise, but how far they may drop.</p> <p>Crude oil prices have fallen more than $10 a barrel in the last month, driving down the retail price of gasoline and providing some relief for consumers. While energy prices remain high, they have not risen to the heights that many analysts had feared, in part because of a light hurricane season this summer, the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, and the fact that the United Nations has not imposed sanctions on Iran.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia on Friday cast new doubt on the prospects for the Bush administration's efforts to punish Iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear program, even as European leaders expressed wariness at moving quickly to impose sanctions.</p> <p>In Moscow, officials expressed regret that an Aug. 31 deadline had passed without an agreement by Iran to halt its efforts to enrich uranium that could be used for building nuclear weapons, as American and European officials believe Iran intends to do.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'freedom and human rights', 'news and news media']	<p>When Vice President Dick Cheney came to this oil-rich Central Asian nation this spring he expressed admiration for what he called its ''political development.'' Yet just a day before his visit began, the authoritarian government effectively shut down the two most prominent American democracy organizations working here.</p> <p>While American officials are negotiating to reverse the government's decision, they have yet to complain about it publicly.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'atomic weapons', 'treaties']	<p>Five nations in Central Asia signed a nuclear-free-zone treaty on Friday that commits the region's rich uranium deposits to peaceful uses but leaves open loopholes that could allow Russia to transport nuclear weapons into Central Asia.</p> <p>It is the first mutual security pact among all five Central Asian nations, a group that has often quarreled about security issues.</p>
['atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>After intense talks about Iran's nuclear program, the United States and other major world powers face two unappealing choices as the United Nations General Assembly opens this week: introduce a resolution in the Security Council for sanctions against Tehran that may not be tough enough to make a difference, or delay any punitive measures, rendering their diplomacy on Iran meaningless.</p> <p>So the Bush administration, along with Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany, have quietly shifted their strategy.</p>
['international trade and world market']	<p>Americans and Europeans are used to buying mass produced shoes, toys and microwave ovens from China. So why not roses?</p> <p>That is the thinking behind an elaborate Chinese government effort to export cut flowers, aimed not just at developing a new business to take on the world but at redeveloping the social and economic landscape here in southwestern China.</p>
['terrorism', 'freedom and human rights', 'news and news media']	<p>Anna Politkovskaya, the veteran Russian journalist and author who made her name as a searing critic of the Kremlin and its policies in Chechnya, was found dead on Saturday in her apartment building, shot in the head with a pistol, the authorities and her colleagues said.</p> <p>Ms. Politkovskaya, 48, was a journalist with few equals in Russia. She was a special correspondent for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper and had become one of the country's most prominent human rights advocates.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The mourners stood in the rain, which fell heavily at moments on Tuesday, fulfilling their part in a ritual of sadness and anger and, politically speaking, inconsequence, which has become strikingly common in Russia today.</p> <p>They gathered, in this case, on the western edge of Moscow for the funeral of Anna Politkovskaya, a tenacious, sometimes reckless, but always passionate journalist and human rights advocate, who died three days ago at the hands of, from all appearances, a professional killer.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday that the United States did not intend to invade or attack North Korea, but she warned the North's leaders that they now risked sanctions ''unlike anything that they have faced before.''</p> <p>Even China, North Korea's most important ally, said Tuesday that tough measures were in order, though its representatives said the punishments might not necessarily be the harsh ones that Washington was proposing.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>As eras go, the post-cold war has been a pretty good one. The collapse of communism, the spread of free-market democracies and the general reign of stability bought and paid for by U.S. power all combined to create a world in which China and India have been able to rise peacefully, America has prospered, and Europe has become whole and free. Yes, there's been 9/11, Bosnia, the rise of the petro-dictators and African wars -- which are hardly trivial. But all in all, compared with the vast repression and nuclear standoff that characterized the cold war, the post-cold-war era has been much better for a lot of humanity.</p> <p>Too bad it's probably over.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>Russia surpassed the United States in 2005 as the leader in weapons deals with the developing world, and its new agreements included selling $700 million in surface-to-air missiles to Iran and eight new aerial refueling tankers to China, according to a new Congressional study.</p> <p>Those weapons deals were part of the highly competitive global arms bazaar in the developing world that grew to $30.2 billion in 2005, up from $26.4 billion in 2004. It is a market that the United States has regularly dominated.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Violent clashes in Budapest on Monday as the police tried to contain a month-old antigovernment protest movement marred the 50th anniversary of Hungary's uprising against Soviet domination.</p> <p>The police used rubber bullets, tear gas and a water cannon to disperse thousands of protesters who had gathered for a rally after a group of them took control of a Soviet-era T-34 tank that was on display for the commemorations and drove it toward the police. About two dozen people were injured, none seriously.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'ethics', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The tale of the 167,000 Motorola cellphones took another turn on Monday.</p> <p>In the first chapter seven months ago, the Interior Ministry seized the phones at a Moscow airport. The ministry said first that the phones were counterfeit, then contraband and then a health hazard. A month later, government officials, with Russian news media cameras flashing, fed thousands of the phones into a chipping machine.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'ethics', 'law and legislation']	<p>The Russian government said Monday that it had begun registering private foreign organizations whose operations in Russia were suspended last week, and that it was rushing to review the amended applications of at least 65 other organizations, which remained idled.</p> <p>Among the groups granted permission to resume work were some that Russian officials had sharply criticized, saying they were encouraging revolutions or meddling in Russia's domestic affairs. They included the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs and the International Republican Institute.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>North Korea said Wednesday that it would consider sanctions a ''declaration of a war'' and vowed to carry out further nuclear tests if the United States maintained a ''hostile attitude.'' The North seems to be following a clear strategy that experts say has allowed it, a small, isolated, nearly bankrupt nation, to keep the attention of the United States for more than a decade.</p> <p>In the country's first remarks since its reported nuclear test on Monday, North Korea said it felt compelled to prove its nuclear capacity to ''protect its sovereignty and right to existence from the daily increasing danger of war'' from the United States.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will urge the countries of northeast Asia to create a strict system of radiation monitoring and inspections to prevent North Korea from smuggling nuclear materials into or out of the country, a senior State Department official said Tuesday.</p> <p>But in what appears to be an effort to cajole China to enforce the new United Nations sanctions against North Korea aggressively, the United States will ask the countries to focus their efforts on conducting inspections in their own territories, including ports, and on suspicious ships, trucks and aircraft rather than every piece of cargo.</p>
['crime and criminals', 'news and news media']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin has a penchant for making pithy, acerbic, sometimes coarse comments. On Wednesday, a microphone inadvertently left on during a brief appearance with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel captured his views on the sex scandal involving Israel's president.</p> <p>According to journalists and officials in the room and published accounts by Agence France-Presse late Wednesday and Kommersant and The Jerusalem Post on Thursday, Mr. Putin was heard saying, ''Say hello to your president,'' to Mr. Olmert, referring to President Moshe Katsav, who could face criminal charges that he raped and assaulted two former employees. Mr. Putin added, ''He really surprised us.''</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>Scores of foreign private organizations were forced to cease their operations in Russia on Thursday while the government considered whether to register them under a new law that has received sharp international criticism.</p> <p>Among the suspended organizations are some of those most critical of the Kremlin, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, and others, like the National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute, that have been accused by Russian officials of instigating or assisting revolutions against other former Soviet republics.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council voted unanimously on Saturday to impose strict sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear test, overcoming objections from Russia and China by explicitly excluding the threat of military force.</p> <p>The resolution, drafted by the United States, clears the way for the toughest international action against North Korea since the end of the Korean War. Primarily, it bars the sale or transfer of material that could be used to make nuclear, biological and chemical weapons or ballistic missiles, and it bans international travel and freezes the overseas assets of people associated with the North's weapons programs.</p>
['foreign investments', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power']	<p>For more than a decade, Dmitri V. Lisitsyn waged a lonely, losing battle to protect the local salmon and gray whales from the world's large oil companies, which are turning bucolic Sakhalin Island into an industrial hub for energy in Asia.</p> <p>Now, Mr. Lisitsyn suddenly has the full support of an unlikely environmental champion: the Russian government.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>Diplomatic tensions between Russia and Georgia worsened significantly on Tuesday when Russian officials vowed to impose indefinite economic sanctions on the nation to the south.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said the suspension of transportation links and postal service -- announced Monday and effective early Tuesday -- was intended to cut what he described as illegal transfers of cash from the sizable Georgian diaspora in Russia. He said the cash was being used to finance Georgia's military buildup.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Israel's Parliament has a long tradition of heated debate, but Avigdor Lieberman may be the only lawmaker who has called for the execution of fellow legislators.</p> <p>Back in May, Mr. Lieberman said he would support the death penalty for Arab lawmakers who met with Hezbollah, the Lebanese guerrilla group, or with Hamas, the radical Islamic faction that heads the Palestinian Authority government. Israel classifies both as terrorist organizations.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'elections', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States proposed tough new United Nations sanctions on North Korea on Monday after its reported test of a nuclear device, and President Bush warned the North that he considered its activity a potential threat to American national security.</p> <p>At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the United States pressed for international inspections of all cargo moving into and out of North Korea to detect weapons-related material, and a ban on all trading in military goods and services with the country.</p>
['immigration and refugees']	<p>Aleksandr A. Belov found wide publicity last year when the organization he created gave a cash award to a Russian woman accused of stabbing an Armenian taxi driver to death. During her trial, covered with lurid relish by the news media, she testified that the driver had tried to rape her.</p> <p>''She rid Moscow of a rapist,'' Mr. Belov told a radio station at the time. Not just a rapist, however: a rapist from abroad. He went on to assert that half of all serious crimes were committed by immigrants, the issue at the heart of his personal mission and, by all appearances, his growing public prominence.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media', 'law and legislation']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized shrinking Russian press freedoms, questioned the enforcement of a restrictive new law on foreign private groups here and called for eased tensions between Russia and neighboring Georgia when she arrived here Saturday to discuss the North Korean nuclear crisis.</p> <p>Ms. Rice's remarks raised the possibility of a testy atmosphere for the discussions in Moscow, the last stop of her pan-Asia trip aimed at urging tough enforcement of the Security Council sanctions imposed on North Korea a week ago in response to its Oct. 9 underground nuclear test.</p>
['finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Russian government has never been straightforward about its plans to take control of the oil and gas business.</p> <p>So, Lithuanians were suspicious when Russia said it shut its pipeline -- the only one supplying Russian crude oil -- in late July because of a leak.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>North Korea said Sunday night that it had set off its first nuclear test, becoming the eighth country in history, and arguably the most unstable and most dangerous, to proclaim that it has joined the club of nuclear weapons states.</p> <p>The test came just two days after the country was warned by the United Nations Security Council that the action could lead to severe consequences.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Russia announced Monday that it was suspending air, rail, sea and road links to its small southern neighbor, Georgia, taking its first significant retaliatory steps after last week's arrests by Georgia of four Russian military officers on accusations of espionage.</p> <p>Several hours after Russia suspended travel, as well as postal service, between the countries, Georgia released the four officers into the custody of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an international body to which both countries belong that had helped negotiate the release.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>The commander of United States military activities in Latin America said Monday that Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez had become a destabilizing force, and that other countries in the Western hemisphere shared that concern.</p> <p>The commander, Gen. Bantz J. Craddock of the Army, said, ''What I have heard in the last few months is more concern by more countries'' about an increase in Venezuela's purchase of weapons, especially small arms.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'espionage']	<p>Russia deported 153 citizens of Georgia on Friday as a wave of punitive measures against Georgian migrants and businesses grew, prompting criticism that the government is carrying out an ethnically motivated campaign of harassment.</p> <p>The deportations came at the end of a week of political and diplomatic conflict between Russia and Georgia that began with the arrests of four Russian military officers for espionage, and has shown little sign of easing despite the officers' release.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States said it had won agreement on Friday from the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany to seek sanctions against Iran over its refusal to shut down a nuclear enrichment program that could be used to build bombs.</p> <p>While the State Department praised the agreement, which was reached at a one-day meeting here of senior officials from the six nations, American diplomats conceded that there could still be long and difficult negotiations over what penalties to impose and their timing.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and three European allies have given Russia and China a draft text for a Security Council resolution against Iran's nuclear program. The proposal includes the extraordinary step of preventing Iranian students from studying nuclear physics at foreign universities and colleges.</p> <p>The draft resolution would also prohibit any technical or financial assistance that could benefit Iran's nuclear program, and would impose a visa ban on any Iranians involved in nuclear activities, according to European diplomats involved in the negotiations.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin, a former spy who is still popular in Russia after six years in office, said Wednesday that he would continue to ''influence the life in our country'' after his second term is up in 2008, but that he would not run for president again.</p> <p>Mr. Putin said he would step down ''even though I like my work.'' Although a third consecutive term is forbidden under Russia's 1993 Constitution, his supporters have called for a referendum to do away with that ban.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States pressed for a Saturday vote on a Security Council resolution that would impose sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear test, but questions from China and Russia on Friday evening cast the timing and possibly the content of the document into doubt.</p> <p>The terms of the resolution had already been softened three times this week to meet objections from China and Russia, and earlier Friday there appeared to be agreement on holding a vote Saturday morning.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The American push to win Security Council backing for tough, swift sanctions against North Korea appeared to be set back by China and Russia on Thursday, in an echo of the obstacles the United States faces in a similar push to punish Iran.</p> <p>The United States circulated a softened draft resolution to the Security Council in response to North Korea's assertion that it conducted a nuclear test on Monday. The United States pressed for a vote by Friday, but China and Russia immediately signaled their opposition to critical parts of the measure and said they needed more time. On Thursday night, a new draft resolution was circulated, and Reuters quoted the Chinese and Russian ambassadors calling the revisions improvements.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The United States and China spoke in a unified voice on Friday to call for the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program, but they did not announce concrete steps to increase pressure on the North Korean government.</p> <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she had been told by the Chinese government that a special envoy sent by Beijing to North Korea had delivered ''a strong message.'' And the Chinese foreign minister, standing beside Ms. Rice, pledged his nation's commitment to breaking the stalemate over the North's nuclear weapons program.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>President Bush arrived here Thursday morning in one of Asia's most prosperous corners, opening a five-day visit that will test whether the Republican defeat last week diminished his influence as he presses other nations to confront Iran and North Korea.</p> <p>Stopping Wednesday in Moscow for refueling, Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, had a 90-minute visit with President Vladimir V. Putin, which the White House described as largely social.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>A meeting of six nations working on a resolution to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions broke up Tuesday evening with the ambassadors reporting widening disagreements and lessening prospects of a swift accord.</p> <p>''The mood is not right for serious discussions,'' said Wang Guangya, the ambassador of China, emerging from the meeting of the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany, whose envoys had gathered at the French Mission.</p>
['airlines and airplanes']	<p>The case of the poisoned former K.G.B. agent took a bizarre twist when British Airways said that traces of radiation had been detected Wednesday on jets that flew between London and Moscow, establishing a possible Russian link and indicating that more than 30,000 people might have been exposed to the radiation.</p> <p>The airline said tests had found ''very low traces'' of radioactivity so far on two of three Boeing 767s, which were singled out because the police suspected that passengers included people linked to the investigation. At least one of the planes flew between London and Moscow days before the former agent, Alexander V. Litvinenko, fell ill from the radioactive poison, polonium 210, that doctors say killed him.</p>
['news and news media', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The British police said Sunday that they were investigating the suspected poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a Russian former K.G.B. operative living in exile in Britain who had been inquiring into the killing of a journalist in Moscow last month.</p> <p>The Russian authorities had no immediate comment on suggestions in news reports that the Russian secret service had poisoned Mr. Litvinenko, who is hospitalized and seriously ill, because he had criticized former colleagues and President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
['energy and power', 'espionage', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>Russia intensified its economic pressure on Georgia on Thursday as the state-controlled gas monopoly, Gazprom, indicated that it would seek to more than double the price it charges for natural gas, beginning in January.</p> <p>The move to raise the price follows a series of punitive restrictions imposed by Russia on trade with Georgia, as relations between the neighbors deteriorated precipitously in recent months.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>Israeli tank shells killed 18 Palestinians, including 8 children and 6 women, at a cluster of houses here on Wednesday, one of the largest single losses of life in Gaza in years.</p> <p>Some Hamas leaders called for a suicide-bombing retaliation inside Israel and, unusually, for the United States to be taught ''hard lessons'' as well.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Russia on Friday submitted a broad revision of a draft resolution designed to curb Iran's nuclear program, and the United States promised counterproposals, casting talks on the subject into increasing doubt and delay.</p> <p>An hourlong meeting of ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany ended with no discussion of specifics, and a decision to circulate the amended drafts among the six governments, said John R. Bolton, the American ambassador.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'international trade and world market', 'gas (fuel)', 'energy and power', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines.</p> <p>Yet onshore, in towns like this one, not a light is to be seen -- not a street lamp, not a glow in a window -- as women crouch by the roadside at dawn, sorting by candlelight the vegetables they will sell for two cents a bunch at the morning market.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'finances']	<p>In a series of closed-door meetings on the edges of the economic summit meeting of Asian nations here, President Bush and his aides have signaled that they will dangle a new set of incentives for North Korea to give up nuclear weapons and technology, American officials said. But the offers would hinge on the North's coming to talks next month agreeing to begin immediately dismantling some of the equipment it is using to build an arsenal.</p> <p>The stepped up diplomatic effort was made as Mr. Bush met leaders of the four countries that surround North Korea for the first time since the North conducted a nuclear test on Oct. 9. The meetings included a warm session with Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and a frosty one with the South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun.</p>
['terrorism', 'united states armament and defense', 'ethics']	<p>Since 1993, when Robert M. Gates left Washington after completing 14 months as head of the Central Intelligence Agency saying it was ''time to get a life,'' he has recalled the capital's clashing egos and the news media's magnifying glass less than fondly.</p> <p>Mr. Gates has kept his distance, basking in the tranquillity of a lakefront house near Seattle and then in the homespun rituals of Texas A&M University, where he has served as president since 2002. He has recalled the public battering he took in two Senate confirmation hearings as ''unpredictable, frustrating, exhausting, insulting, humiliating'' -- in short, ''a lot like a root canal.''</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Inside the Kremlin last week, the executives of three major international companies -- Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi and Mitsui -- heaped praise on the man whose government had effectively forced them to cede control of the world's largest combined oil and natural gas project.</p> <p>''Thank you very much for your support,'' Shell's chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, told President Vladimir V. Putin during a meeting that ended a six-month regulatory assault on the project, Sakhalin II, but only after the companies surrendered control of it to the state energy giant, Gazprom. ''This was a historic occasion.''</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, threatened Tuesday to halt natural gas supplies to Belarus if that country did not agree to a large price increase by the first of the year.</p> <p>The strong Russian position suggests that Moscow is becoming aggressive in energy pricing even with countries that have been close allies.</p>
['public opinion', 'books and literature', 'gas (fuel)', 'energy and power', 'ethics']	<p>Perhaps the kindest thing to say about Gerhard Schröder's return to private life last year is that it was not as unseemly as that of his predecessor as German chancellor, Helmut Kohl.</p> <p>Mr. Kohl admitted he took illegal cash payments, leaving his reputation in tatters. Mr. Schröder, by contrast, took a job as chairman of the board of a Russian-German pipeline joint venture, and was roundly condemned by critics who said he had championed the pipeline while in office and improperly cashed in on his friendship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>After months of missed deadlines, threats and counterproposals in the effort to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions, the fragile coalition of six world powers that has been facing down Tehran may be about to splinter.</p> <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sounded fed up Thursday with Russia's refusal to sign on to the list of United Nations Security Council sanctions the United States would like to see enacted against Iran.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved sanctions intended to curb Iran's nuclear program, capping months of negotiations over how severe and sweeping the restrictions should be.</p> <p>The resolution, prepared by Germany and the Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- bans the import and export of materials and technology used in uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missiles.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'ethics']	<p>Montenegro has never seen anything quite like the Hotel Splendid. For almost half a mile, this complex of penthouse suites, swimming pools and boutiques stretches along the Adriatic shoreline providing unparalleled luxury for those who can afford it.</p> <p>But like many of the projects backed by Russian investment funds that have recently poured into this small country, the hotel has earned a less than glamorous reputation. Three bombs exploded at the site during construction. The police officer investigating the blasts was killed. When the hotel opened in September, guests were bused in under the watchful eyes of armed guards.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, agreed on Friday to continue supplying gas to Georgia, but at double the price, the latest increase for a pro-Western nation on Russia's border.</p> <p>Aleksandr I. Medvedev, Gazprom's deputy chief executive, said three Georgian importers had agreed to buy gas at the company's asking price of $235 for 1,000 cubic meters, close to that paid by richer nations in Europe.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program ended Friday without tangible progress, and Pyongyang quickly renewed threats to ''improve its nuclear deterrent.''</p> <p>American and Asian diplomats said that during five days of negotiations in Beijing, the North Korean delegation had declined to discuss disarmament in formal sessions, insisting it would do so only after the United States removed financial measures that have further isolated North Korea from the international economy.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The Security Council postponed voting Friday on a resolution aimed at halting Iran's nuclear program, after Russia objected that the document restricted legitimate business activities.</p> <p>After a full day of negotiations, however, the resolution's European sponsors were optimistic that the Security Council would approve a slightly altered version by the end of the day on Saturday. The altered version of the resolution is aimed at satisfying Russia's demands without weakening the measure in such a way that it would be unpalatable to the Americans and Europeans.</p>
['religion and churches', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Islamic militants are using a recent peace deal with the government to consolidate their hold in northern Pakistan, vastly expanding their training of suicide bombers and other recruits and fortifying alliances with Al Qaeda and foreign fighters, diplomats and intelligence officials from several nations say. The result, they say, is virtually a Taliban mini-state.</p> <p>The militants, the officials say, are openly flouting the terms of the September accord in North Waziristan, under which they agreed to end cross-border help for the Taliban insurgency that revived in Afghanistan with new force this year.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>For Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, 2006 is ending as it began: in a dispute over prices and control of a pipeline in a neighboring country that is threatening the smooth flow of natural gas to Europe.</p> <p>But this time, the price increase was levied on a Russian ally, Belarus, a country whose foreign policy is aligned with Moscow in all but one important aspect: support for increasing cash flow at Gazprom.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The European sponsors of a resolution to take steps against Iran for its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear activities submitted a freshly revised draft to the Security Council on Wednesday evening and called for a vote on Friday.</p> <p>In a major concession to Russia, the principal dissenter during the months it has taken to settle on the language of the resolution, the final revision eases a travel ban on people involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>The chief American negotiator at talks to address North Korea's nuclear program said Wednesday that the parties could reach a new agreement on rolling back North Korea's bomb-making effort this week, but the prospects for a meaningful breakthrough remained uncertain.</p> <p>The chief negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters that the United States, North Korea and the four other countries participating in the Chinese-sponsored talks had begun discussing details of how to carry out a 2005 draft agreement on ending North Korea's nuclear program. He said the tenor of the often tortuous discussions had improved.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The United States and North Korea staked out tough positions as six-nation disarmament negotiations began here on Monday, two months after North Korea tested an atomic weapon.</p> <p>The senior United States negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, warned North Korea that it faced an extended period of sanctions if it refused to abandon its nuclear-weapons program.</p>
['energy and power', 'finances', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Statoil of Norway agreed on Monday to buy the oil and gas operations of a rival, Norsk Hydro, in an estimated $28 billion deal that would create the world's largest off-shore operator and a new national energy champion.</p> <p>Combining Statoil with the gas and oil operations of Norsk Hydro will create a Norwegian powerhouse that produces 1.9 million barrels a day and will be controlled by Norway's government.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'public opinion', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>With gradations of unease rather than outrage inspired by the hanging of Saddam Hussein, Western politicians sought a cautious balance on Saturday between revulsion at his record, support for his executioners and concern at the use of a capital penalty they largely shun in their own countries.</p> <p>But religious leaders -- Christian and Muslim -- used stronger and more critical language in response to the news of Mr. Hussein's execution, which greeted most Western Europeans on their breakfast time news shows and in some newspaper headlines two days before the New Year.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'immigration and refugees']	<p>Maria Sadina hunched over fading pictures of her parents, ethnic Germans who were deported in 1941 from the Volga region in Russia to one of Karaganda's many gulag camps.</p> <p>Ms. Sadina's father was imprisoned for praising the quality of a German-made tractor, and for a decade he worked as a slave laborer in the nearby coal mines. Her mother was sent to the Karaganda gulag simply for her German heritage.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The tangled tale of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the maverick Russian K.G.B. agent turned dissident who died of radiation poisoning last week, has seized the headlines recently, but its roots can be traced to a late spring evening in Moscow in 1994.</p> <p>At just after 5 p.m. on June 7, Boris A. Berezovsky, one of Russia's most powerful oligarchs, was leaving the offices of his car dealership in a chauffeured Mercedes 600. According to Russian news accounts at the time, he and his bodyguard were sitting in the rear seat behind the driver. As the car drove by a parked vehicle, a remote-controlled bomb detonated, decapitating the driver but somehow leaving Mr. Berezovsky unscathed.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>Europeans produced a revised draft of a Security Council resolution on Iran on Friday, and said they would formally introduce it on Monday in the hope of obtaining a speedy vote on much-delayed action to curb Tehran's nuclear program.</p> <p>The text was drawn up after weeks of meetings in European capitals among the three nations drafting the measure, Britain, France and Germany, in consultation with the United States. It is aimed at meeting persistent objections from China and Russia.</p>
['ethics', 'international trade and world market', 'law and legislation']	<p>Saparmurat Niyazov, the authoritarian president of Turkmenistan, died unexpectedly early Thursday, the Turkmen government said, raising questions about succession and stability in a nation that is essential to European energy supplies.</p> <p>Mr. Niyazov, who gave himself the name Turkmenbashi, or the Head of All Turkmen, had ruled his sparsely populated nation since becoming chairman of the Turkmen Communist Party in 1985, when the country was a Soviet republic.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances', 'energy and power']	<p>Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, bought control of the world's largest combined oil and natural gas development Thursday after a highly publicized campaign of pressure on its foreign operator, Royal Dutch Shell.</p> <p>Shell's sale of 50 percent plus one share followed months of accusations against the project by a Russian environmental regulator -- a problem that President Vladimir V. Putin, in announcing Gazprom's entry, said would now most likely be resolved.</p>
['economic conditions and trends']	<p>Karl Marx wrote that the state was nothing more than the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. But in Russia, President Vladimir Putin has stood Marx on his head: the state dominates many of the most important businesses, not the other way around. A new hybrid of country and corporation has been created, fusing the public and private sectors together to serve the Kremlin. Andrei Illarionov, who in December 2005 resigned as an economic adviser to Putin, calls it ''a corporate state.''</p>
['terrorism', 'law and legislation', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Marina Litvinenko, the widow of the former K.G.B. agent who died of radiation poisoning in London, said Friday that he began to worry about the safety of Russian exiles like himself in July, when the Parliament in Moscow, with little overseas fanfare, approved a law legalizing strikes beyond Russia's borders against those the Kremlin considered to be extremists or terrorists.</p> <p>But she said her husband, Alexander V. Litvinenko, still felt protected by asylum in Britain.</p>
['immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights', 'taxation']	<p>To those fearful of homegrown Muslim extremism, this city was Londonistan. But now, after the mysterious poisoning death of the former K.G.B. agent Alexander V. Litvinenko, other sobriquets are more current: Londongrad, Moscow-on-the-Thames.</p> <p>The new names reflect the changes wrought here by a complicated influx from beyond the Urals, one that has built with ever greater pace since the cold war.</p>
['ethics', 'biographical information']	<p>In a sign of the growing reach of Russia's business elite, a billionaire tried -- and for a time succeeded -- in blocking an article in the Russian language edition of Forbes magazine which featured her on its cover.</p> <p>The episode led to the resignation of Forbes' editor in Russia last week and once again raised questions about intimidation of the press here.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>The chief American envoy to talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program said Monday morning that he hoped a new round of six-nation negotiations would get under way shortly, and he expressed cautious optimism about prospects for reaching a settlement.</p> <p>The envoy, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, told reporters after consultations with the Chinese in Beijing that he felt there was a new ''basis for making progress.'' He said China, the host of the talks, may announce the start date for a new session shortly.</p>
['terrorism', 'immigration and refugees', 'freedom and human rights', 'espionage']	<p>THIS week the United States government will begin automatically declassifying hundreds of millions of documents from the cold war, under a law meant to streamline the cost and hassle of keeping secret files that are more than 25 years old. Among the dossiers bearing names like Alger Hiss, Theodore Hall and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will be one labeled ''Frigyes Klein'': my father, Fred Klein.</p> <p>My father was never a spy, never a member of the Communist Party. He came by ship to the United States in 1956, fleeing Communism during the Hungarian revolution to pursue the American dream. He worked on a Ford automobile assembly line in Cincinnati by day and moonlighted sharpening lawnmowers at night, saving enough money in a few years to buy a small house. To him, treasonous behavior meant buying a car made outside of America. Nonetheless, as I discovered recently, the F.B.I. kept a file on him from the day he arrived in the United States.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Bronze Soldier stands in a small park near Tallinn's lovely Old Town, staring mournfully at the snow-covered earth, helmet in hand. An inscription in Russian and Estonian says simply, ''To the fallen of the Second World War.'' It is far less conspicuous, as war monuments go, than the furor its fate has caused.</p> <p>Estonia's Parliament, led by Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, laid the legal foundation this month to dismantle the Bronze Soldier and relocate it to a military cemetery or a memorial park on the nearby Gulf of Finland. The monument, supporters said, has become a source of tension, not remembrance, which has proved to be the case.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'war and revolution']	<p>China and Russia vetoed an American-drafted resolution on Friday calling for the military rulers of Myanmar to release all political prisoners, cease attacks on ethnic minorities and speed a transition to democracy.</p> <p>The vote was 9 to 3 with South Africa joining China and Russia in opposition, and three other countries, Congo Republic, Indonesia and Qatar, abstaining.</p>
['foreign investments', 'banks and banking', 'stocks and bonds', 'international trade and world market', 'finances']	<p>SOUTH AFRICA is a nation of contradictions. Crowded high-end malls, political stability and the country's designation as host of the 2010 World Cup reflect a sense of optimism and progress. And yet 16 years after the end of apartheid, this nation of 45 million continues to grapple with widespread poverty and H.I.V., which affects about 12 percent of the population.</p> <p>Signs of the nation's growing prosperity as well as its continuing challenges are evident at the gleaming Johannesburg Stock Exchange, whose bathrooms feature boxes with free condoms to stop the spread of AIDS.</p>
['atomic energy']	<p>India sealed a wide-ranging package of agreements with Russia on Thursday, the first day of a summit meeting intended to demonstrate that their longstanding relationship had not deteriorated as a result of India's growing engagement with the United States.</p> <p>In a joint statement issued after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, Russia offered to build four new nuclear power plants in India, in addition to the two reactors it is already building here.</p>
['oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>When BP announced a landmark investment of $6.15 billion in Russia in 2003, the event was celebrated with a healthy dose of British pomp and circumstance.</p> <p>President Vladimir V. Putin flew to London for the announcement of a joint venture, standing with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, who called the deal a ''concrete testament'' to Britain's long-term confidence in Russia. BP's chief executive, John Browne, who announced his retirement unexpectedly on Friday, was personally instrumental in brokering the deal.</p>
['terrorism', 'bombs and explosives']	<p>After nine months without a suicide bombing in Israel, a Palestinian walked from Egypt across the open desert border, hitched a ride from a wary Israeli motorist and then blew himself up on Monday inside a bakery in the Red Sea resort town of Eilat, Israeli officials said.</p> <p>Three Israelis who worked in the bakery were killed by the blast; it was the first time that Eilat, isolated at the very southern tip of Israel, has ever been hit by a suicide bombing.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)']	<p>As a New Year's deadline arrived, Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, struck a deal early Monday to supply gas to Belarus for the next five years, averting a price dispute that threatened to disrupt supplies to Europe, the company said in a statement.</p> <p>The agreement, reached as the Russian capital celebrated the New Year with rolling displays of fireworks, more than doubled the price that Belarus will pay for natural gas this year and raised it significantly in the years to come.</p>
['embargoes and economic sanctions', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus appeared to be the last leader in the old Soviet neighborhood to realize that he was dealing with a different Russia.</p> <p>For much of last year, he dragged out negotiations on new gas and energy deals, assuming that pleas of solidarity and Slavic brotherhood -- encapsulated in a dusty treaty that a decade ago envisioned a glorious Union State of Belarus and Russia -- would avert a steep rise in prices.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Seeking to revive stalled negotiations to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the United States held ''substantive'' talks with North Korean diplomats here on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill.</p> <p>The unusual one-on-one sessions, the first to be held outside Beijing during the Bush administration, were signs of progress since negotiations broke off in December after North Korea demanded that Washington lift financial sanctions against it.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The United States and four other nations reached a tentative agreement to provide North Korea with roughly $400 million in fuel oil and aid, in return for the North's starting to disable its nuclear facilities and allowing nuclear inspectors back into the country, according to American officials who have reviewed the proposed text.</p> <p>While the accord sets a 60-day deadline for North Korea to accomplish those first steps toward disarmament, it leaves until an undefined moment in the future -- and to another negotiation -- the actual removal of North Korea's nuclear weapons and the fuel that it has manufactured to produce them.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Qatar on Monday to discuss trade, security and the possible formation of a natural gas cartel on the second leg of a three-day tour of the Middle East that is widely seen as an attempt to expand Russia's strategic role in the region.</p> <p>''We seek to develop special relations between Qatar and Russia,'' Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, said shortly after Mr. Putin arrived. ''Relations at all levels have been developing vigorously over the past year and a half.''</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Officials in the Czech Republic and Poland vowed Tuesday that they would not be intimidated by Russia, a day after a general in Moscow declared that nuclear weapons could be aimed at their countries if they allowed the Bush administration to build ballistic missile defenses within their borders.</p> <p>Russia has reacted with open hostility to the plan, which comes on the heels of further NATO expansion onto the territory of the former Soviet Union.</p>
['television', 'international trade and world market', 'taxation']	<p>Hollywood has often been a whipping boy here, but with a new Congress in session, the heads of the major movie studios converged on the capital Tuesday to pitch their industry in the unaccustomed role of good guy: boon to the trade balance, engine of economic growth, polisher of the nation's image and employer of a big, uncelebrated, middle-class work force.</p> <p>Cheered by the Democratic takeover, the industry's leadership hopes to press its agenda of fighting piracy, obtaining new tax advantages and reining in movie and television production from going abroad.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>On a Friday night in late December, the tortuous three-year diplomatic effort to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program finally seemed dead. Two months earlier, North Korea had conducted its first nuclear weapons test, and five days of talks in Beijing had just ended in failure and acrimony.</p> <p>But that evening, the American team sent a messenger to the gated North Korean Embassy. Would the North be interested in a private, bilateral meeting outside Beijing? A few days later, the North agreed and chose a location -- Berlin.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Foreign policy experts are still trying to parse Vladimir Putin's weekend blast against America, which he described as a brutish country that ''has overstepped its national borders, in every area.'' But rather than asking what exactly motivated Mr. Putin to lash out at the U.S. in this way, the question we should be asking is: why do remarks like these play so well in Russia today?</p> <p>I've just returned from Moscow and I can tell you what analysts there told me, what even Russian liberals reminded me of: NATO expansion. We need to stop kidding ourselves. After the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, the Bush I and Clinton administrations decided to build a new security alliance -- an expanded NATO -- and told Russia it could not be a member.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>It is hard to imagine that either George W. Bush or Kim Jong-il would have agreed even a year ago to the kind of deal they have now approved. The pact, announced Tuesday, would stop, seal and ultimately disable North Korea's nuclear facilities, as part of a grand bargain that the administration has previously shunned as overly generous to a repressive country -- especially one that has not yet said when or if it will give up its nuclear arsenal.</p> <p>But in the past few months, the world has changed for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim, two men who have made clear how deeply they detest each other. Both are beset by huge problems, and both needed some kind of breakthrough.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'foreign aid']	<p>The deal that could lead North Korea to shut its main nuclear reactor came under criticism from both ends of the political spectrum immediately after it was announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>From the right, hardliners argued that the United States should have held out until North Korea agreed to fully declare and dismantle its entire nuclear program.</p>
['united states armament and defense', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>American officials said Tuesday that they had agreed to hold the highest-level contact with the Iranian authorities in more than two years as part of an international meeting on Iraq.</p> <p>The discussions, scheduled for the next two months, are expected to include Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Iranian and Syrian counterparts.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Bush administration officials tried Wednesday to tamp down Russian concerns, voiced in strikingly harsh terms, over American plans to base missile defenses in Eastern Europe.</p> <p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the missile defense proposal, which calls for deploying 10 interceptors in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic, was solely intended to counter the possible development of long-range Iranian missiles.</p>
['foreign aid', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Fractures between the United States and Europe began to appear Wednesday over whether the new Palestinian unity government was likely to receive international economic support even as the Middle East peace negotiators officially continued their wait-and-see approach.</p> <p>After the meeting here of representatives of the so-called quartet of Middle East peace negotiators -- the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union -- the group released a statement that ''reaffirmed'' its support for a Palestinian government that would recognize Israel and renounce violence.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'economic conditions and trends', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'energy and power']	<p>Russia today is a country that takes three hands to describe.</p> <p>On the one hand, it is impossible any more to call Vladimir Putin's government ''democratic,'' given the way it has neutered the Russian Parliament, intimidated or taken over much of the Russian press, subordinated the judiciary and coercively extended its control over the country's key energy companies.</p>
['elections']	<p>Sergei B. Ivanov walked in late to the holiday performance of the army's Academy of Song and Dance. He sat in a seat saved for him between a mop-haired boy and a girl with a fluffy white ribbon in her hair. He watched, stiffly tapping his foot, as Soldier Ivan danced with fairies on his way to saving the children's New Year's presents from the old witch Baba Yaga. Grandfather Frost Russia's Santa Claus arrived in the end, of course, with gifts for the children in the audience, sons and daughters of Russia's military men. The soldier/actor's voice boomed as he introduced ''a very big present,'' ''our wonderful guest'': Ivanov, then the country's minister of defense (and soon to be named first deputy prime minister), the man who might well be the next president of Russia.</p>
['arms control and limitation and disarmament', 'energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>By now we can too readily imagine the horror of terrorists exploding a nuclear weapon in a major American city: the gutted skyscrapers, the melted cars, the charred bodies. For Sam Nunn, however, a new terror begins the day after. That's when the world asks whether another bomb is out there. ''If a nuclear bomb went off in Moscow or New York City or Jerusalem, any number of groups would claim they have another,'' Nunn told me recently. These groups would make steep demands as intelligence officials scrambled to determine which claims were real. Panic would prevail. Even after the detonation of a small, crude weapon that inflicted less damage than the bomb at Hiroshima, Nunn suggested, ''the psychological damage would be incalculable. It would be a slow, step-by-step process to regain confidence. And the question will be, Why didn't we take steps to prevent this? We will have a whole list of things we wish we'd done.''</p>
['atomic weapons', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The coalition of six world powers that has been trying to get Iran to rein in its nuclear program will begin drafting a new United Nations Security Council resolution to ratchet up the pressure again, officials said Monday after a meeting in London.</p> <p>Top officials from the United States, Britain, China, Russia, Germany and France agreed to begin working on the resolution after the International Atomic Energy Agency reported last week that Iran was expanding its efforts to enrich uranium, in continuing defiance of the United Nations.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>Two candidates in local elections here in March, a soccer star and figure skating champion, have no known intention of giving up sports for legislative politics. If they win, as they almost certainly will, their Kremlin-friendly parties, not the voters, will choose the candidates to fill their seats.</p> <p>An opposition party was kicked off the ballot for forging signatures but given little chance to prove otherwise. Government-controlled television has effectively barred parties except those loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin from the airwaves.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'finances', 'atomic energy']	<p>Russia said Monday that it would slow work on Iran's nearly completed Bushehr nuclear power plant.</p> <p>Russia contended that Iran had not made the last two $25 million monthly payments, in a dispute about whether it could pay in euros instead of dollars.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Britain and the United States said Friday that they were discussing the stationing of an American antiballistic missile defense system on British soil.</p> <p>The United States previously offered to locate the missile system in the Czech Republic and Poland, drawing furious objections from Russia, though Washington argues that the system is not built to defend against Russia but against Iran, principally, and other potential threats.</p>
['atomic weapons']	<p>Negotiators on Thursday will resume the long-stalled talks aimed at North Korean nuclear disarmament amid tentative signs of a possible breakthrough in a diplomatic process that seemed shattered four months ago when North Korea tested a nuclear device.</p> <p>Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy, arrived in Beijing on Wednesday and held separate meetings with Chinese and Russian diplomats. Mr. Hill has been shuttling around the world, meeting with envoys from North Korea and other countries, in an effort to restart and advance the talks that North Korea abandoned more than a year ago.</p>
['energy and power', 'international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>There may be only one thing dumber than getting addicted to consuming oil as a country -- and that is getting addicted to selling it. Because getting addicted to selling oil can make your country really stupid, and if the price of oil suddenly drops, it can make your people really revolutionary. That's the real story of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union -- it overdosed on oil -- and it could end up being the real story of Iran, if we're smart.</p> <p>It is hard to come to Moscow and not notice what the last five years of high oil prices have done for middle-class consumption here. Five years ago, it took me 35 minutes to drive from the Kremlin to Moscow's airport. On Monday, it took me two and half hours. There was one long traffic jam from central Moscow to the airport, because a city built for 30,000 cars, which 10 years ago had 300,000 cars, today has three million cars and a ring of new suburbs.</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'gas (fuel)', 'finances']	<p>Even as the United States intensifies its efforts to isolate Iran, President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that Russia would consider OPEC-like cooperation with Tehran on sales of natural gas. He stopped short of endorsing price fixing, however, saying he was concerned only with ensuring stable supplies for consuming nations.</p> <p>Mr. Putin reiterated Russia's opposition to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, but his remarks underscored a widening rift with the United States and its allies over how to force Tehran to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>
['terrorism', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia accused the United States on Saturday of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses, undermining international institutions and making the Middle East more unstable through its clumsy handling of the Iraq war.</p> <p>In an address to an international security conference, Mr. Putin dropped all diplomatic gloss to recite a long list of complaints about American domination of global affairs, including many of the themes that have strained relations between the Kremlin and the United States during his seven-year administration.</p>
['terrorism', 'atomic weapons', 'foreign aid', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program stalled on Saturday as disagreements arose about the size and timing of the aid package that would be provided to North Korea in exchange for shutting down the country's nuclear weapons facilities.</p> <p>''The differences on the issue still remain large,'' said Qin Gang, spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>IRAN has once again defied the United Nations by proceeding with enrichment activities, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported yesterday. And yet, simultaneously, Iranian officials have been sending a very different message -- one that has gone largely unremarked but merits close attention.</p> <p>After a meeting with the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leader's chief foreign policy adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, declared last week that suspending uranium enrichment is not a red line for the regime -- in other words, the mullahs might be ready to agree to some kind of a suspension. Another powerful insider, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said much the same thing in a different setting, while a third high-ranking official acknowledged that the Islamic Republic is seriously considering a proposal by President Vladimir Putin of Russia to suspend enrichment at least long enough to start serious negotiations with the United Nations.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Here in Russia's third-largest city on Saturday, barely was a banner unfurled or an anti-Kremlin slogan chanted before a wave of heavily armored police officers engulfed a small group of demonstrators and journalists gathered for a protest against President Vladimir V. Putin's government.</p> <p>Protest organizers said about 200 marchers made it to Gorky Square in the city center before the police, wielding nightsticks, descended. About 10 elderly people yelling ''Fascists! Fascists!'' pressed their backs against the shields of a second wave of police officers but were knocked to the ground. After the initial police charge, most demonstrators melted into the crowd of onlookers, though the police herded about 30 people, including some foreign news photographers, into waiting buses.</p>
['suits and litigation', 'ethics']	<p>The editor in chief of the Russian edition of Forbes magazine was found guilty of defamation Wednesday in a dispute over an article about a business run by the wife of the mayor of Moscow.</p> <p>In a legal interpretation that is likely to further chill journalism in Russia, a city court in Moscow ruled against the editor, Maksim V. Kashulinsky, not for the contents of the article, but for commenting publicly on the controversy surrounding its publication.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'war and revolution']	<p>THE six-party agreement signed with North Korea last month should certainly be applauded as a necessary first step in improving relations with the United States. While a good deal of the North Korean program is shrouded in mystery -- just this week the United States again urged the North Koreans to disclose any uranium-enrichment activities -- there are some things we do know, including the nature and status of the country's reactors.</p> <p>North Korea's one functioning reactor, at Yongbyon, uses natural uranium for fuel and graphite as its moderator (the substance that slows the neutrons and enhances the fission reaction). These are the same ingredients used in the first reactor ever designed, which was tested by Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago in 1942. The best estimate is that Yongbyon has produced about 100 pounds of plutonium since it went into full operation in 1990. This is enough for six to eight nuclear bombs, depending on their design. (The North Koreans might have used about six kilograms in their Oct. 9 test.) The construction of the larger reactors North Korea was building was apparently already suspended, for various technical reasons, before the agreement.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin has ruled it out, and the Kremlin was quick to do so again on Friday, but the idea never quite dies: amending Russia's Constitution to allow Mr. Putin to extend his presidency beyond its legal end in 2008, now only a year away.</p> <p>The proposal seemed to gain new life when Sergei Mironov, the chairman of the upper house of Parliament, or Federation Council, proposed Friday not only to allow Mr. Putin to seek a third term but also to expand presidential terms to five or seven years from the current four.</p>
['television', 'espionage', 'assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>A few hours after meeting a former K.G.B. general outside a spy museum here, an outspoken critic of the Kremlin became engulfed in the kind of intrigue he studies when he was shot Thursday outside his suburban Maryland home.</p> <p>The shooting occurred four days after the critic, Paul M. Joyal, warned on ''Dateline NBC,'' the television news magazine, that a ''message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin: 'If you do, no matter who you are, where you are, we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible.'' Mr. Joyal was speaking about the poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a K.G.B. defector, who was poisoned last fall in London.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>An unusually large and unruly protest against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin ended here Saturday in clashes with the police and the arrest of opposition leaders. Rally organizers and the police said more than 100 people were arrested after a midafternoon scuffle between marchers and riot police on the main street, Nevsky Prospekt, in the heart of the city's tourist district. St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, is Mr. Putin's hometown.</p> <p>The rally was held in advance of local elections scheduled for March 11. Opposition events typically draw no more than several hundred people, but several thousand gathered for the rally in Vosstaniya Square.</p>
['public opinion', 'elections', 'atomic weapons', 'terrorism', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>To hear the Democrats vying for the 2008 presidential nomination tell it, their foreign-policy views represent a sharp, even radical break with the course the Bush administration has pursued since 9/11. Senator Hillary Clinton has contrasted President Bush's unilateralism with what she has called her own internationalism. Senator Barack Obama vowed to provide ''the kind of leadership we need to re-establish our standing in the world and renew our allies' respect.'' Former Senator John Edwards has emphasized his differences with the administration's domestic policy, but he has also promised to abandon a foreign policy ''based on ideology'' and to ''return America to its place of moral leadership.''</p>
['news and news media', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Riot police officers swarmed on a group of several dozen journalists and demonstrators on Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's third-largest city, cutting off a protest against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin.</p> <p>The police, vastly outnumbering the protesters and wielding night sticks and metal shields, detained about 30 people, the Interfax agency quoted a spokesman as saying. A protest organizer said the number of people detained at the raid was more than 100, plus another 100 who had been arrested in an earlier roundup. Among those detained were several foreign and Russian journalists, including a photographer for The New York Times who was later released.</p>
['frauds and swindling', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>Only a few visible traces of Yukos Oil remain in Nefteyugansk, a remote Siberian town so inseparable from Russia's energy wealth that it has neft, or oil, in its name. Here and there, workers' barracks, trucks and some aging equipment are still painted yellow and green, the color of Yukos's logo.</p> <p>The rest of what was once the most valuable subsidiary of the richest Russian company has new colors -- black and gold -- and a new owner, Rosneft.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'embargoes and economic sanctions', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Russia has informed Iran that it will withhold nuclear fuel for Iran's nearly completed Bushehr power plant unless Iran suspends its uranium enrichment as demanded by the United Nations Security Council, European, American and Iranian officials say.</p> <p>The ultimatum was delivered in Moscow last week by Igor S. Ivanov, the secretary of the Russian National Security Council, to Ali Hosseini Tash, Iran's deputy chief nuclear negotiator, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a confidential diplomatic exchange between two governments was involved.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>Dmitri V. Kovtun arrived in London for the first time in his life last Oct. 16. He dropped his bags off at a hotel near Piccadilly Circus and immediately went to meet, also for the first time, Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer whose killing by radioactive poisoning five weeks later became one of the most celebrated crimes of the post-cold-war era.</p> <p>British investigators quickly zeroed in on Mr. Kovtun and an associate of his, Andrei K. Lugovoi, who both met with Mr. Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day he fell ill. But Mr. Kovtun says they have it backward, maintaining that Oct. 16 was the day that Mr. Litvinenko exposed him to the poison, polonium 210. ''I am far from thinking that something was premeditated,'' Mr. Kovtun said. ''I think things that were not premeditated were happening.''</p>
['energy and power', 'atomic weapons', 'atomic energy']	<p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran wants to take part in a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to brief member states about Iran's nuclear program, a government spokesman said Sunday on state-run television.</p> <p>''The president of Iran plans to speak in a possible meeting of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear program to defend the right of the Iranian nation to use peaceful nuclear technology,'' said the government spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham.</p>
['atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'atomic weapons', 'finances', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>The Security Council received on Thursday a draft of a new resolution to impose sanctions on Iran for its defiance of demands that it suspend its nuclear enrichment activities and return to negotiations over its nuclear program.</p> <p>The measure expands a roster from an earlier resolution that lists companies and individuals subject to an assets freeze. Among them are Bank Sepah, four groups controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force, and seven commanders identified as ''key persons'' in the corps.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'law and legislation', 'civil war and guerrilla warfare', 'war and revolution']	<p>LATE last month some 25,000 people held a rally in the Afghan capital, Kabul. Were they calling for more aid? Were they rallying to demand military action against the Taliban? No, they were urging President Hamid Karzai to sign a law providing legal amnesty for actions committed during the civil war that raged in Afghanistan during and after the Soviet occupation.</p> <p>While the law has passed both houses of Afghanistan's Parliament, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and several humanitarian groups have argued against it on the grounds that it eliminates any possibility for justice for the people killed, tortured and raped during that awful period. Some have made subtle threatens, saying that should Mr. Karzai sign the law, he might have a harder time getting international aid. I understand such humanitarian feelings and the calls for justice, but President Karzai should sign the law -- for four good reasons.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday appointed Ramzan A. Kadyrov, a widely feared young official whose security forces have been accused of kidnappings, torture and other abuses, to be president of Chechnya, the battered southern republic.</p> <p>The appointment, while expected, cemented Mr. Kadyrov's position as the dominant political figure in Chechnya, where Russian and Chechen forces have largely quashed a separatist movement after two wars, beginning in 1994.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'news and news media', 'elections']	<p>At their first meeting with journalists since taking over Russia's largest independent radio news network, the managers had startling news of their own: from now on, they said, at least 50 percent of the reports about Russia must be ''positive.''</p> <p>In addition, opposition leaders could not be mentioned on the air and the United States was to be portrayed as an enemy, journalists employed by the network, Russian News Service, say they were told by the new managers, who are allies of the Kremlin.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution']	<p>Estonia's government removed a Soviet-era war memorial early on Friday morning after a night of protest and violence that killed one person, injured dozens and left a swath of shattered windows and overturned cars in the center of the capital, Tallinn, officials there said.</p> <p>The removal of the monument, which includes a six-and-a-half-foot sculpture known as the Bronze Soldier, prompted a renewed diplomatic fury in neighboring Russia, where officials have repeatedly declared that tampering with the monument amounted to blasphemy and even the glorification of Nazism.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>When the United States first asked Poland and the Czech Republic to base missile defenses on their soil, the proposed interceptors and radar were cast as a prudent hedge against Iran and a guarantee that Europe's security was indivisible from that of America, which was moving ahead with defenses for its own territory.</p> <p>But with Russia's rejection of a new American invitation to cooperate on missile defense -- a rebuff delivered with an exclamation point when the Kremlin threatened Thursday to pull out of a treaty on conventional weapons in Europe -- the initiative risked driving Moscow further from Europe and dividing Europe's public over the future of its shared security.</p>
['airlines and airplanes', 'finances']	<p>Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, made a surprise bid on Monday for all or part of Italy's national airline, Alitalia, as one of three potential buyers to meet a deadline set by the Italian ministry of finance.</p> <p>If successful, Aeroflot's bid for the Italian flag carrier would be its first large investment outside the former Soviet Union, and it would be in keeping with a trend of Russian state-owned businesses making strategic investments in Europe.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>A fragile power-sharing deal in Ukraine collapsed Monday when President Viktor A. Yushchenko ordered the dissolution of Parliament, the base of support for his rival, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, whom the president accused of usurping power. Mr. Yushchenko ordered new elections for May 27, less than eight weeks away.</p> <p>Mr. Yanukovich's supporters in Parliament responded by calling an emergency session and passing a resolution declaring Mr. Yushchenko's decree to disband Parliament unconstitutional. The deputies also voted against allocating money for the new elections.</p>
['energy and power', 'gas (fuel)', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, has made handsome profits selling natural gas to Europe.</p> <p>Now the company is positioning itself to make even more money, this time from the effluents from all that gas it sells to Europe. Gazprom announced Tuesday that it is selling carbon dioxide emissions credits that companies in the European Union need in order to burn Gazprom's fuel.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>The Bush administration is offering Russia a new package of incentives to drop its strong opposition to American missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, including an invitation to begin linking some American and Russian antimissile systems, according to senior administration and military officials.</p> <p>The package includes American offers to cooperate on developing defense technology and to share intelligence about common threats, as well as to permit Russian officials to inspect the future missile bases.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's first democratically elected president, was buried Wednesday after a somber, symbolic funeral service attended by Russia's political elite, current and former world leaders, family and close friends.</p> <p>The service was held in full accordance with Orthodox Christian tradition in the ornate Christ the Savior Cathedral, which was destroyed by the Soviet government in 1931, the year of Mr. Yeltsin's birth, and reconstructed with his approval. It was the first time since the death of Czar Aleksandr III in 1894 that the Orthodox church officially presided over the funeral of a head of state.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market', 'embargoes and economic sanctions']	<p>Iran said Sunday that it was seeking international bids for building two more nuclear power plants despite international pressure over its nuclear program.</p> <p>''Iran is launching two international tenders for the construction of two nuclear power stations of between 1,000 and 1,600 megawatts capacity in Bushehr,'' said Ahmad Fayazbakhsh, the deputy head of the nation's Atomic Energy Organization, who was quoted by the ISNA news agency.</p>
['legislatures and parliaments', 'freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots', 'elections']	<p>Riot police officers dispersed an opposition rally in St. Petersburg on Sunday, rounding up and arresting protesters and their leaders in a chaotic street scene.</p> <p>The crackdown, on several hundred people who had gathered for an authorized rally but who then began an unauthorized march, followed a similar police action on Saturday in Moscow after a protest that attracted several thousand people.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates pressed the Kremlin's top leaders on Monday to accept a detailed new plan for cooperation on missile defense in Europe that he said would make Russia a full partner in the American effort by sharing information, jointly developing new technology and even combining the two countries' defensive radar systems.</p> <p>The immediate answer from Russia's new defense minister, Anatoly E. Serdyukov, was a firm statement that the Kremlin had not dropped its strong opposition to American proposals for antimissile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion turned opposition politician in Russia, was arrested with nearly 200 other protesters during a rally in Moscow on Saturday that ended in clashes with riot troops.</p> <p>The rally, the third so-called Dissenters' March held by a loose antigovernment coalition known as Other Russia, was noteworthy because authorities aggressively pursued the organizers, including President Vladimir V. Putin's former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, whom the police jostled but did not arrest. Mr. Kasparov was later fined and released.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that Russia would suspend its compliance with a treaty on conventional arms in Europe that was forged at the end of the cold war, opening a fresh and intense dispute in the souring relations between NATO and the Kremlin.</p> <p>The announcement, made in Mr. Putin's annual address to Parliament, underscored the Kremlin's anger at the United States for proposing a new missile defense system in Europe, which the Bush administration insists is meant to counter potential threats from North Korea and Iran.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>Much of Europe is arguing over a Washington proposal to plant in Poland fewer than a dozen antimissile missiles that might not work, to guard against an Iranian threat that may not exist.</p> <p>The main party in Poland's governing coalition is inclined to accept the deal, and the country's president, Lech Kaczynski, known in Europe for his fierce conservatism and nationalist talk, has been invited to the White House in July to talk things over with President Bush.</p>
['bombs and explosives', 'news and news media', 'law and legislation']	<p>Two suicide car bombs killed 25 people near Ramadi on Monday, the provincial security chief said, dealing a blow to a city recently considered a showcase for the strategy of integrating former insurgents into the Iraqi security forces.</p> <p>In Baghdad, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki spoke by secure video conference with President Bush about the Iraqi government's efforts to move forward on legislation that will help salvage the crumbling relationship between Shiite and Sunni Arab factions in the government, said Tony Snow, the White House spokesman.</p>
['terrorism', 'religion and churches', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>On Thursday there will be a regional conference in Egypt to discuss stabilizing Iraq, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will represent the U.S. President Bush should go instead and give this speech:</p> <p>I want to take this opportunity to speak to the Arab and Muslim nations gathered here today and to the world at large. I begin with a simple message: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I rushed into the invasion of Iraq. I honestly believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. I was wrong, and I now realize that in unilaterally launching the war the way I did, you all feel that I breached a bond of trust between America and the world. Not only did that alienate you from us, it made us less effective in Iraq. We had too few allies and too little legitimacy. I apologize -- sincerely.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>Russia held a test launching of a new intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday and said it had successfully fired the weapon almost entirely across its northern airspace to the Russian Far East.</p> <p>The launching of the missile, which traveled more than 5,000 miles and was covered extensively on state television, occurred as President Vladimir V. Putin again chided the West for American-led plans to install an antimissile shield in Europe.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>The United States and its European allies, acting despite opposition from Russia, scheduled a vote for Wednesday on a binding Security Council resolution establishing an international court to try those suspected of killing Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister.</p> <p>Mr. Hariri, 60, an anti-Syrian politician, was killed along with 22 others when a car bomb exploded as his convoy was passing on a downtown Beirut street in February 2005. The public outcry that followed forced Syria to end its 29-year dominating presence in Lebanon.</p>
['treaties']	<p>Russia called Monday for an emergency meeting with the United States and European countries to discuss the future of a conventional arms treaty in Europe, which President Vladimir V. Putin suspended last month and has threatened to withdraw from altogether.</p> <p>The request for a meeting, which Russia asked to be held in mid-June, could be a step toward scuttling the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, known as C.F.E.</p>
['international trade and world market', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline', 'gas (fuel)', 'law and legislation', 'energy and power']	<p>The Russian government continued Monday to press its strategy of securing for Gazprom, the state-owned natural gas company, a monopoly on exports to Asia.</p> <p>In doing so, it is threatening an important investment by a big British rival, BP, with methods similar to those used last fall to force Royal Dutch Shell to sell a controlling stake in another energy development in the Russian Far East, the Sakhalin II project. Gazprom was also the beneficiary in that case.</p>
['demonstrations and riots', 'war and revolution', 'computers and the internet']	<p>When Estonian authorities began removing a bronze statue of a World War II-era Soviet soldier from a park in this bustling Baltic seaport last month, they expected violent street protests by Estonians of Russian descent.</p> <p>They also knew from experience that ''if there are fights on the street, there are going to be fights on the Internet,'' said Hillar Aarelaid, the director of Estonia's Computer Emergency Response Team. After all, for people here the Internet is almost as vital as running water; it is used routinely to vote, file their taxes, and, with their cellphones, to shop or pay for parking.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Bush, under pressure from allies in Europe to be more forthcoming about his plans for basing missile interceptors in the region, said Monday that he was intensifying his efforts to persuade Russia to cooperate with the United States on the initiative ''so that they don't see us as an antagonistic force, but see us as a friendly force.''</p> <p>Mr. Bush said he was trying to convince President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that cooperation was ''in Russia's security interests,'' even though Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates did not win Mr. Putin's support during a trip to Moscow last week.</p>
['united states armament and defense']	<p>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that while Russia and the United States were going through a period of uneasy relations, the problems fell far short of those of the cold war and that the two countries continued to cooperate in a number of important areas.</p> <p>''Russia is not the Soviet Union, so this is not a U.S.-Soviet relationship,'' Ms. Rice said, speaking en route to Moscow and planned meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin and senior Russian officials.</p>
['treaties', 'missiles and missile defense systems', 'atomic weapons']	<p>THE criticism by Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, of the United States and NATO put one in mind of an alpha dog at the junkyard gate -- tough, unrelenting, pugnacious. The trend started with his Feb. 10 speech in Munich, and in Moscow on April 26 his annual address to Parliament carried it forward. He railed against foreigners trying to change the economic and political system, even the culture, of the Russian Federation and called for a new law to prevent such imprecations. He also suspended Russian participation in a key arms control agreement, the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.</p> <p>Russians are clearly frustrated with what they perceive to be a lack of respect for their concerns, especially regarding the proposed deployment of American missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic. But to insist that the United States and NATO are the enemy? The argument contradicts Russia's own interests, never mind that it has little link to reality. The cold war is, in fact, over.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>AS we all know, there is such a thing as a good idea whose time has not yet come. This adage can hold even for presidents of the United States.</p> <p>A case in point is the American proposal to establish a new ballistic missile defense site in Poland and the Czech Republic. The system -- which would complement the one established in recent years in California and Alaska -- is intended primarily to protect Europe and America from a missile launched from the Middle East. It is in principle a worthy idea, but the military benefits in the short term are not worth the worsening of relations with Russia that it has already engendered.</p>
['religion and churches', 'united states armament and defense', 'war and revolution']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin seemed to obliquely compare the foreign policy of the United States to the Third Reich in a speech on Wednesday commemorating the 62nd anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany.</p> <p>The comments were the latest in a series of sharply worded Russian criticisms of the foreign policy of the United States -- on Iraq, missile defense, NATO expansion and, more broadly, United States unilateralism in foreign affairs.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>Germany's relations with Russia were never likely to be as cozy under Angela Merkel as under her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, who adopted a 3-year-old Russian girl and, on his 60th birthday, invited President Vladimir V. Putin home to celebrate.</p> <p>But Mrs. Merkel's tense exchanges with Mr. Putin over human rights and other contentious issues at a Europe-Russia summit meeting last week underscore how much has changed, at least in tone.</p>
['demonstrations and riots']	<p>Diplomatic tensions between Russia and Estonia spilled into the streets on Wednesday as protesters disrupted a news conference by the Estonian ambassador, harassed diplomats at the embassy and briefly blocked trucks crossing the border near St. Petersburg.</p> <p>Russia escalated the dispute when a spokesman for the state rail company told news agencies that repairs would be scheduled on its links entering Estonia, halting shipments of oil to the country's Baltic Sea ports. Russia has been criticized for cutting off energy to punish neighbors that fall from favor.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>The United States and Russia, with relations between them at their most contentious since the collapse of the Soviet Union, openly sparred here on Wednesday at a meeting of foreign ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, accused the United States of starting a new arms race and implicitly threatened to veto any United Nations Security Council resolution that, like the one proposed by the United States and its European allies, would recognize the independence of Kosovo.</p>
['assassinations and attempted assassinations']	<p>A divided Security Council approved a resolution on Wednesday establishing an international tribunal to prosecute suspects in the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister.</p> <p>Ten of the 15 members of the Council voted in favor, one more than the nine votes needed for passage. But five countries -- Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar -- abstained.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'foreign investments', 'finances', 'oil (petroleum) and gasoline']	<p>The Kremlin is hoping it can put the focus on gains in the Russian economy at a forum for business leaders next month in St. Petersburg, highlighting growth that has been overshadowed by negative political news from Russia.</p> <p>The Russian government has billed the gathering in St. Petersburg as a kind of Davos for emerging markets, with an emphasis on Russia's oil-driven economy.</p>
['banks and banking', 'economic conditions and trends', 'television', 'news and news media', 'finances', 'computers and the internet']	<p>The computer attacks, apparently originating in Russia, first hit the Web site of Estonia's prime minister on April 27, the day the country was mired in protest and violence. The president's site went down, too, and soon so did those of several departments in a wired country that touts its paperless government and likes to call itself E-stonia.</p> <p>Then the attacks, coming in waves, began to strike newspapers and television stations, then schools and finally banks, raising fears that what was initially a nuisance could have economic consequences.</p>
['news and news media', 'demonstrations and riots']	<p>The police detained more than a dozen opposition leaders and journalists here on Friday, preventing them from flying to a provincial city to take part in anti-Kremlin protests. The action followed a wave of harassment of the protest's organizers.</p> <p>The detentions added a new element of frostiness to President Vladimir V. Putin's meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders of the European Union near the city, Samara.</p>
['news and news media']	<p>The largest society of independent journalists in Russia, long critical of the Kremlin's curtailment of the independent news media, defied a government eviction notice on Friday, saying it would try to remain in its offices in spite of state pressure.</p> <p>The refusal by the society, the Russian Union of Journalists, to follow the government's order punctuated a day of resistance to a fresh round of crackdowns on the independent news media here.</p>
['economic conditions and trends', 'books and literature', 'freedom and human rights']	<p>When President Bush declared last week that political openness naturally accompanied economic openness, his counterparts in Beijing and Moscow were not the only ones to object. Liberal and conservative intellectuals, even once ardent supporters, have backed away from the century-old theory that democracy and capitalism, like Paris Hilton and paparazzi, need each other to survive.</p> <p>From China, where astounding economic growth persists despite Communist Party rule, to Russia, where President Vladimir V. Putin has squelched opposition, to Venezuela, where dissent is silenced, developments around the world have been tearing jawbreaker-size holes in what has been a remarkably powerful idea, not only in academic circles but also in both Republican and Democratic administrations -- that capitalism and democracy are two sides of a coin.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin offered new suggestions on Friday for alternatives to a missile defense system in Europe, saying Russia would not object to American interceptor missiles in Iraq, Turkey or at sea, and proposing that Russia and the West study emerging missile threats jointly.</p> <p>Mr. Putin made his latest proposals hours after Azerbaijan said it was willing to discuss another Russian proposal, made Thursday, to use a Soviet-era early warning radar on its territory in the Caucasus as part of a missile defense system against Iran.</p>
['airlines and airplanes']	<p>The Boeing Company announced on Saturday a $3.5 billion sale of airplanes to Aeroflot, the Russian national airline, in a deal that defied the souring political relations between the United States and Russia.</p> <p>Boeing characterized the deal, which ended a high-stakes battle with its European rival, Airbus, as a vote of confidence in the quality of its new 787 Dreamliner airplane. The model is selling well even in countries otherwise loath to patronize American businesses.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'crime and criminals', 'finances']	<p>The United States appears to be close to reaching a deal to transfer $25 million in frozen funds to North Korea, with Russia and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acting as intermediaries, in hopes of getting North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program, American officials said Monday.</p> <p>The funds have been frozen for nearly two years at a bank that the Bush administration has labeled a violator of American money laundering laws. Because of that label, the bank is barred from doing business with any bank in the United States.</p>
['energy and power', 'finances', 'atomic energy', 'international trade and world market']	<p>Seventy years after the United States invented uranium enrichment, the sole American company in the business is struggling to survive, while nuclear power experts worry that its failure would leave the Russians dominant in the market for fuel processing.</p> <p>The company, USEC, has liquidated some of its valuable uranium inventories to stay afloat, as its income has declined because of changing market conditions. But it had also maintained a high dividend, bought back stock and spent heavily on severance payments after frequent purges in the executive suite. The company spent more than $100 million on two new technologies for enrichment before abandoning them and embarking on a third.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'computers and the internet']	<p>The United States and Russia have agreed to accelerate a program that detects radioactive materials along Russia's borders and plan to have automated detection systems installed at all Russian border crossing points by 2011, American energy officials said Thursday.</p> <p>As part of the agreement, the program, administered jointly by Russia's federal custom service and the National Nuclear Security Administration in the United States, will be completed six years ahead of schedule.</p>
['freedom and human rights']	<p>A top Russia expert at the State Department issued an unusually sharp public criticism on Thursday of Moscow's behavior under President Vladimir V. Putin, describing the Kremlin as bullying its neighbors while silencing political opponents and suppressing individual rights at home.</p> <p>The comments, approved by the White House, are the latest volley of criticism between Washington and Moscow in recent days. Although the White House said this week that President Bush would play host to Mr. Putin on July 1 at the Bush family compound in Maine, the speech is likely to add tension at a time when the broader dialogue between Washington and Moscow is already taking the most caustic tones since the collapse of communism.</p>
['freedom and human rights', 'missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>President Bush delivered a two-pronged message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday, two days before their scheduled meeting in Germany, chiding Mr. Putin for derailing democratic reforms while assuring the Russian leader that he had nothing to fear from a missile defense system in Europe.</p> <p>Mr. Bush issued the human rights rebuke on the first day of an eight-day swing through Europe, in a venue laden with symbolism: a conference on democracy co-led by the former Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky. Democracy advocates and dissidents from 17 countries had gathered in Czernin Palace, in the very room where the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was dissolved, to hear Mr. Bush speak.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems']	<p>After months of angrily rejecting a White House plan for missile defense in Europe, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia surprised President Bush on Thursday with an offer to build a joint system in the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.</p> <p>The proposed system, designed to guard against a missile attack from Iran, poses serious diplomatic and technical challenges, experts said. But the fact that it was suggested by Mr. Putin, and not immediately rejected by Mr. Bush, indicated a desire on both sides to cool the hostile exchanges that in recent months had driven relations to a low point in the post-cold-war era.</p>
['religion and churches']	<p>Barbed wire still lines the perimeter of the secret police compound here on the southern edge of Moscow where more, perhaps far more, than 20,000 people were shot and buried from August 1937 through October 1938, at the height of Stalin's purges.</p> <p>Now, gradually, Butovsky poligon -- literally, the Butovo shooting range -- is becoming a shrine to all of the victims of Stalin's murderous campaigns. Grass-covered mounds holding the victims' bones crisscross the pastoral field, which is now dotted with flowers and birch trees.</p>
['elections', 'law and legislation']	<p>President Vladimir V. Putin said that Russia could benefit from longer presidential terms, though he again ruled out the possibility that he would remain in office after the expiration of his second term next year, according to remarks published Monday.</p> <p>The remarks, made in an interview with a group of invited journalists from Group of 8 countries at his residence outside Moscow on Friday, further clouded the situation around Mr. Putin's post-presidential plans and his possible successor. The Kremlin published the text of the interview at kremlin.ru/eng/.</p>
['missiles and missile defense systems', 'united states armament and defense', 'atomic energy']	<p>At a moment of rising tensions between Washington and Moscow, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia appear likely to use a meeting in Germany this week to focus on the one area where they appear to share a common interest: slowing Iran's ability to produce nuclear fuel.</p> <p>On virtually everything else -- independence for Kosovo, missile defense and a sharp turn toward authoritarianism in Russia -- Mr. Bush's aides say they expect to have little leverage over Mr. Putin. Over the weekend, the Russian president threatened to once again point missiles at European targets if the United States went through with its plan to build a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
['espionage']	<p>Russia's intelligence service said Friday that it had opened a criminal investigation into British espionage here in Russia, based on statements and undisclosed evidence provided by a businessman who is accused of poisoning Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer and a Kremlin critic.</p> <p>The announcement by the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor of the Soviet K.G.B., further confused a murder investigation that has soured relations between Russia and Britain. The countries have staked out starkly different positions regarding the killing of Mr. Litvinenko and the motives behind it.</p>
['atomic weapons', 'united states armament and defense']	<p>A year after President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced a new strategy toward Iran, a behind-the-scenes debate has broken out within the administration over whether the approach has any hope of reining in Iran's nuclear program, according to senior administration officials.</p> <p>The debate has pitted Ms. Rice and her deputies, who appear to be winning so far, against the few remaining hawks inside the administration, especially those in Vice President Dick Cheney's office who, according to some people familiar with the discussions, are pressing for greater consideration of military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>
